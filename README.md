| **[DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLSM-Ensemble: Ensembling CLIP-based Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05154v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL 2025) short paper</p></details> |
| **[TriCLIP-3D: A Unified Parameter-Efficient Framework for Tri-Modal 3D Visual Grounding based on CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14904v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChordPrompt: Orchestrating Cross-Modal Prompt Synergy for Multi-Domain Incremental Learning in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19608v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hues and Cues: Human vs. CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02305v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with the commonly used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures. 8th annual conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |
| **[Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20760v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> |
| **[Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15779v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

| **[Language-Aware Information Maximization for Transductive Few-Shot CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00305v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly, we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is publicly available at:\[ \href{https://github.com/ghassenbaklouti/LIMO}{\text{here}} \]</p></details> |  |
| **[EZ-Sort: Efficient Pairwise Comparison via Zero-Shot CLIP-Based Pre-Ordering and Human-in-the-Loop Sorting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21550v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at CIKM 2025 (ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management)</p></details> |
| **[InterCLIP-MEP: Interactive CLIP and Memory-Enhanced Predictor for Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16464v6)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcasm in social media, often expressed through text-image combinations, poses challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been demonstrated to overly rely on spurious cues within the textual modality, revealing a limited ability to genuinely identify sarcasm through nuanced text-image interactions. To solve this problem, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, which introduces Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) with an efficient training strategy to extract enriched text-image representations by embedding cross-modal information directly into each encoder. Additionally, we design a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP) with a dynamic dual-channel memory that stores valuable test sample knowledge during inference, acting as a non-parametric classifier for robust sarcasm recognition. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant accuracy and F1 score improvements on MMSD and MMSD2.0.

| **[Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP. In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, code:https://github.com/chi-chi-zx/FSA</p></details> |
| **[ReCLIP++: Learn to Rectify the Bias of CLIP for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06747v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works utilize CLIP to perform the challenging unsupervised semantic segmentation task where only images without annotations are available. However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/dogehhh/ReCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our CVPR 24 paper</p></details> |
| **[Know "No" Better: A Data-Driven Approach for Enhancing Negation Awareness in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10913v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While CLIP has significantly advanced multimodal understanding by bridging vision and language, the inability to grasp negation - such as failing to differentiate concepts like "parking" from "no parking" - poses substantial challenges. By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[ProPy: Building Interactive Prompt Pyramids upon CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19024v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins.

| **[From Global to Local: Social Bias Transfer in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17750v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases, learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all? We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias, finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally, we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias mitigation practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Capacity and Low-PAPR BICM-OFDM Systems Using Non-Equiprobable and Non-Uniform Constellation Shaping With Clipping and Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15639v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution, and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters, each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

| **[CLIPSym: Delving into Symmetry Detection with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14197v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision, and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant decoder, and the SAPG technique.

| **[WP-CLIP: Leveraging CLIP to Predict Wölfflin's Principles in Visual Art](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12668v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP, on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles.

| **[Style Ambiguity Loss Using CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02055v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore using the style ambiguity training objective, originally used to approximate creativity, on a diffusion model. However, this objective requires the use of a pretrained classifier and a labeled dataset. We introduce new forms of style ambiguity loss that do not require training a new classifier or a labeled dataset. Instead of using a classifier, we generate centroids in the CLIP embedding space, and images are classified based on their relative distance to said centroids. We find the centroids via K-means clustering of an unlabeled dataset, as well as using text labels to generate CLIP embeddings, to be used as centroids.

| **[Continual Learning on CLIP via Incremental Prompt Tuning with Intrinsic Textual Anchors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20680v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[CLAIR: CLIP-Aided Weakly Supervised Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12290v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin, Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | BMVC 2025 |
| **[TokLIP: Marry Visual Tokens to CLIP for Multimodal Comprehension and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05422v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[A CLIP-based Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) Framework for Pedestrian Re-Identification in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11218v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00098v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains. Code of all experiments and benchmarks is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-pfl4asr.</p></details> | Under review |

| **[Revolutionizing Reinforcement Learning Framework for Diffusion Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06949v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose TraceRL, a trajectory-aware reinforcement learning framework for diffusion language models (DLMs) that incorporates preferred inference trajectory into post-training, and is applicable across different architectures. Equipped with a diffusion-based value model that enhances training stability, we demonstrate improved reasoning performance on complex math and coding tasks. Besides, it can also be applied to adapt block-specific models to larger blocks, which improves sampling flexibility. Employing TraceRL, we derive a series of state-of-the-art diffusion language models, namely TraDo. Although smaller than 7B-scale AR models, TraDo-4B-Instruct still consistently outperforms them across complex math reasoning tasks. TraDo-8B-Instruct achieves relative accuracy improvements of 6.1% over Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct and 51.3% over Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Through curriculum learning, we also derive the first long-CoT DLM, outperforming Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct on MATH500 with an 18.1% relative accuracy gain. To facilitate reproducible research and practical applications, we release a comprehensive open-source framework for building, training, and deploying diffusion LLMs across diverse architectures. The framework integrates accelerated KV-cache techniques and inference engines for both inference and reinforcement learning, and includes implementations of various supervised fine-tuning and RL methods for mathematics, coding, and general tasks.

| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach limits interaction between SFT and RL, thereby constraining overall effectiveness. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outcome-based Exploration for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06941v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL, which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation, where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and (ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration, which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

However, it remains difficult for many industrial and commercial actors to decide on whether they should adopt distributed solar-battery systems, which is largely due to the unavailability of fast, low-cost, and high-resolution irradiance forecasts. Here, we present SunCastNet, a lightweight data-driven forecasting system that provides 0.05$^\circ$, 10-minute resolution predictions of surface solar radiation downwards (SSRD) up to 7 days ahead. SunCastNet, coupled with reinforcement learning (RL) for battery scheduling, reduces operational regret by 76--93\% compared to robust decision making (RDM). In 25-year investment backtests, it enables up to five of ten high-emitting industrial sectors per region to cross the commercial viability threshold of 12\% Internal Rate of Return (IRR). These results show that high-resolution, long-horizon solar forecasts can directly translate into measurable economic gains, supporting near-optimal energy operations and accelerating renewable deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main text ~12 pages, 4 figures, 0 tables</p></details> |
| **[Off-Policy Maximum Entropy RL with Future State and Action Visitation Measures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06655v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum entropy reinforcement learning integrates exploration into policy learning by providing additional intrinsic rewards proportional to the entropy of some distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel approach in which the intrinsic reward function is the relative entropy of the discounted distribution of states and actions (or features derived from these states and actions) visited during future time steps. This approach is motivated by three results. First, this new objective is a lower bound on the negated entropy of the marginal visitation distribution of states and actions, commonly used as an alternative exploration objective. Second, a policy maximizing the expected discounted sum of intrinsic rewards also maximizes a lower bound on the state-action value function of the decision process. Third, the distribution used in the intrinsic reward definition is the fixed point of a contraction operator. Existing algorithms can therefore be adapted to learn this fixed point off-policy and compute the intrinsic rewards. We finally introduce an algorithm maximizing our new objective and show that resulting policies have good state-action space coverage and achieve high-performance control.</p></details> |  |
| **[Staying in the Sweet Spot: Responsive Reasoning Evolution via Capability-Adaptive Hint Scaffolding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06923v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy. Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint (part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5 points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[The Majority is not always right: RL training for solution aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06870v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling up test-time compute, by generating multiple independent solutions and selecting or aggregating among them, has become a central paradigm for improving large language models (LLMs) on challenging reasoning tasks. While most prior work relies on simple majority voting or reward model ranking to aggregate solutions, these approaches may only yield limited benefits. In this work, we propose to learn aggregation as an explicit reasoning skill: given a set of candidate solutions, we train an aggregator model to review, reconcile, and synthesize a final, correct answer using reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. A key ingredient is careful balancing of easy and hard training examples, allowing the model to learn both to recover minority-but-correct answers as well as easy majority-correct answers. Empirically, we find our method, AggLM, outperforms both strong rule-based and reward-model baselines, across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it generalizes effectively to solutions from differing models, including stronger ones than contained in the training data, all while requiring substantially fewer tokens than majority voting with larger numbers of solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[floq: Training Critics via Flow-Matching for Scaling Compute in Value-Based RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06863v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD) methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq (flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching, typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly 1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures, highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement learning meets bioprocess control through behaviour cloning: Real-world deployment in an industrial photobioreactor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06853v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inherent complexity of living cells as production units creates major challenges for maintaining stable and optimal bioprocess conditions, especially in open Photobioreactors (PBRs) exposed to fluctuating environments. To address this, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL) control approach, combined with Behavior Cloning (BC), for pH regulation in open PBR systems. This represents, to the best of our knowledge, the first application of an RL-based control strategy to such a nonlinear and disturbance-prone bioprocess. Our method begins with an offline training stage in which the RL agent learns from trajectories generated by a nominal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller, without direct interaction with the real system. This is followed by a daily online fine-tuning phase, enabling adaptation to evolving process dynamics and stronger rejection of fast, transient disturbances. This hybrid offline-online strategy allows deployment of an adaptive control policy capable of handling the inherent nonlinearities and external perturbations in open PBRs. Simulation studies highlight the advantages of our method: the Integral of Absolute Error (IAE) was reduced by 8% compared to PID control and by 5% relative to standard off-policy RL. Moreover, control effort decreased substantially-by 54% compared to PID and 7% compared to standard RL-an important factor for minimizing operational costs. Finally, an 8-day experimental validation under varying environmental conditions confirmed the robustness and reliability of the proposed approach. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of RL-based methods for bioprocess control and paves the way for their broader application to other nonlinear, disturbance-prone systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[UMO: Scaling Multi-Identity Consistency for Image Customization via Matching Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06818v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However, since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching" paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity preserving.

| **[Reward function compression facilitates goal-dependent reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06810v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning agents learn from rewards, but humans can uniquely assign value to novel, abstract outcomes in a goal-dependent manner. However, this flexibility is cognitively costly, making learning less efficient. Here, we propose that goal-dependent learning is initially supported by a capacity-limited working memory system. With consistent experience, learners create a "compressed" reward function (a simplified rule defining the goal) which is then transferred to long-term memory and applied automatically upon receiving feedback. This process frees up working memory resources, boosting learning efficiency. We test this theory across six experiments. Consistent with our predictions, our findings demonstrate that learning is parametrically impaired by the size of the goal space, but improves when the goal space structure allows for compression. We also find faster reward processing to correlate with better learning performance, supporting the idea that as goal valuation becomes more automatic, more resources are available for learning. We leverage computational modeling to support this interpretation. Our work suggests that efficient goal-directed learning relies on compressing complex goal information into a stable reward function, shedding light on the cognitive mechanisms of human motivation. These findings generate new insights into the neuroscience of intrinsic motivation and could help improve behavioral techniques that support people in achieving their goals.</p></details> |  |

A key ingredient of our analysis is showing that the optimal robust $Q$ operator is a strict contraction with respect to a carefully designed semi-norm (with constant functions quotiented out). This property enables a stochastic approximation update that learns the optimal robust $Q$-function using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We also provide an efficient routine for robust $Q$-function estimation, which in turn facilitates robust critic estimation. Building on this, we introduce an actor-critic algorithm that learns an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy within $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ samples. We provide numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of our algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The actor-critic result and its proof have been updated.

| **[Physics-informed Value Learner for Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06782v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the coexistence of distinct vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) connectivity requirements, together with highly dynamic and heterogeneous network topologies, presents significant challenges for unified reliability modeling and resource optimization. To address these issues, we propose VariSAC, a graph neural network (GNN)-augmented deep reinforcement learning framework for assured, time-continuous connectivity in RIS-assisted, ISAC-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) systems. Specifically, we introduce the Continuous Connectivity Ratio (CCR), a unified metric that characterizes the sustained temporal reliability of V2I connections and the probabilistic delivery guarantees of V2V links, thus unifying their continuous reliability semantics. Next, we employ a GNN with residual adapters to encode complex, high-dimensional system states, capturing spatial dependencies among vehicles, base stations (BS), and RIS nodes. These representations are then processed by a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) agent, which jointly optimizes channel allocation, power control, and RIS configurations to maximize CCR-driven long-term rewards. Extensive experiments on real-world urban datasets demonstrate that VariSAC consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of continuous V2I ISAC connectivity and V2V delivery reliability, enabling persistent connectivity in highly dynamic vehicular environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</p></details> |  |

While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress, fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs, highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.

In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, first version</p></details> |

Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency FURUTA pendulum platform.

Despite advances in deep generative models, there is no consensus metric for their evaluation. We focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Group Effect Enhanced Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning for Individual Travel Behavior Modeling under Incentives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06656v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy, generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).</p></details> |  |
| **[ReST-RL: Achieving Accurate Code Reasoning of LLMs with Optimized Self-Training and Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19576v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models (PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on coding problems to verify the validity of the proposed RL paradigm. Upon comparison, our approach significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g., PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g., APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the reasoning ability of LLM policies.

| **[IntrEx: A Dataset for Modeling Engagement in Educational Conversations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06652v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Engagement and motivation are crucial for second-language acquisition, yet maintaining learner interest in educational conversations remains a challenge. While prior research has explored what makes educational texts interesting, still little is known about the linguistic features that drive engagement in conversations. To address this gap, we introduce IntrEx, the first large dataset annotated for interestingness and expected interestingness in teacher-student interactions. Built upon the Teacher-Student Chatroom Corpus (TSCC), IntrEx extends prior work by incorporating sequence-level annotations, allowing for the study of engagement beyond isolated turns to capture how interest evolves over extended dialogues. We employ a rigorous annotation process with over 100 second-language learners, using a comparison-based rating approach inspired by reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to improve agreement. We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can predict human interestingness judgments. We find that LLMs (7B/8B parameters) fine-tuned on interestingness ratings outperform larger proprietary models like GPT-4o, demonstrating the potential for specialised datasets to model engagement in educational settings. Finally, we analyze how linguistic and cognitive factors, such as concreteness, comprehensibility (readability), and uptake, influence engagement in educational dialogues.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 Findings camera-ready, 9+7 pages</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Aware RAG: MoL-Enhanced RL for Efficient Training and Scalable Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06650v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems rely heavily on the retrieval stage, particularly the coarse-ranking process. Existing coarse-ranking optimization approaches often struggle to balance domain-specific knowledge learning with query enhencement, resulting in suboptimal retrieval performance. To address this challenge, we propose MoLER, a domain-aware RAG method that uses MoL-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning to optimize retrieval. MoLER has a two-stage pipeline: a continual pre-training (CPT) phase using a Mixture of Losses (MoL) to balance domain-specific knowledge with general language capabilities, and a reinforcement learning (RL) phase leveraging Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize query and passage generation for maximizing document recall. A key innovation is our Multi-query Single-passage Late Fusion (MSLF) strategy, which reduces computational overhead during RL training while maintaining scalable inference via Multi-query Multi-passage Late Fusion (MMLF). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets show that MoLER achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming baseline methods. MoLER bridges the knowledge gap in RAG systems, enabling robust and scalable retrieval in specialized domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Game Theory and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Zonal Ancillary Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03288v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We characterize zonal ancillary market coupling relying on noncooperative game theory. To that purpose, we formulate the ancillary market as a multi-leader single follower bilevel problem, that we subsequently cast as a generalized Nash game with side constraints and nonconvex feasibility sets. We determine conditions for equilibrium existence and show that the game has a generalized potential game structure. To compute market equilibrium, we rely on two exact approaches: an integrated optimization approach and Gauss-Seidel best-response, that we compare against multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. On real data from Germany and Austria, simulations indicate that multi-agent deep reinforcement learning achieves the smallest convergence rate but requires pretraining, while best-response is the slowest. On the economics side, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning results in smaller market costs compared to the exact methods, but at the cost of higher variability in the profit allocation among stakeholders. Further, stronger coupling between zones tends to reduce costs for larger zones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Small Vectors, Big Effects: A Mechanistic Study of RL-Induced Reasoning via Steering Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06608v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols. These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral changes induced by reasoning training.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Steering LLM Reasoning Through Bias-Only Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18706v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that training a single $d$-dimensional steering vector per layer with reinforcement learning, while freezing all base weights, matches the accuracy of fully RL-tuned reasoning models on mathematical-reasoning tasks. On an 8 billion-parameter model this adds only $\approx 0.0016\%$ additional parameters and reproduces performance across a range of base models and mathematical-reasoning benchmarks. These results tighten the upper bound on the parameter budget required for high-level chain-of-thought reasoning, indicating that millions of adapter weights are unnecessary. The minimal trainable footprint reduces optimizer memory and inter-GPU communication, lowering the overall cost of fine-tuning. Moreover, a logit-lens analysis shows that the learned vectors amplify coherent token directions, providing clearer insight into the model's internal computations.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[Emergent Hierarchical Reasoning in LLMs through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03646v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven highly effective at enhancing the complex reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet underlying mechanisms driving this success remain largely opaque. Our analysis reveals that puzzling phenomena like ``aha moments", ``length-scaling'' and entropy dynamics are not disparate occurrences but hallmarks of an emergent reasoning hierarchy, akin to the separation of high-level strategic planning from low-level procedural execution in human cognition. We uncover a compelling two-phase dynamic: initially, a model is constrained by procedural correctness and must improve its low-level skills. The learning bottleneck then decisively shifts, with performance gains being driven by the exploration and mastery of high-level strategic planning. This insight exposes a core inefficiency in prevailing RL algorithms like GRPO, which apply optimization pressure agnostically and dilute the learning signal across all tokens. To address this, we propose HIerarchy-Aware Credit Assignment (HICRA), an algorithm that concentrates optimization efforts on high-impact planning tokens. HICRA significantly outperforms strong baselines, demonstrating that focusing on this strategic bottleneck is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. Furthermore, we validate semantic entropy as a superior compass for measuring strategic exploration over misleading metrics such as token-level entropy.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Molecular Generative Adversarial Network with Multi-Property Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00081v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), have been employed for $de~novo$ molecular generation in drug discovery. Most prior studies have utilized reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, particularly Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), to handle the discrete nature of molecular representations in GANs. However, due to the inherent instability in training GANs and RL models, along with the high computational cost associated with MCTS sampling, MCTS RL-based GANs struggle to scale to large chemical databases. To tackle these challenges, this study introduces a novel GAN based on actor-critic RL with instant and global rewards, called InstGAN, to generate molecules at the token-level with multi-property optimization. Furthermore, maximized information entropy is leveraged to alleviate the mode collapse. The experimental results demonstrate that InstGAN outperforms other baselines, achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art models, and efficiently generates molecules with multi-property optimization. The source code will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

To enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs, diverse Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based fine-tuning approaches have been proposed to address the limited generalization capability of LLMs trained solely via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Despite their effectiveness, two major limitations hinder the advancement of LLMs. First, vanilla RL-based approaches ignore annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and incorporate unstable reasoning path sampling, which typically results in model collapse, unstable training process, and suboptimal performance. Second, existing SFT approaches generally overemphasize the annotated CoT, potentially leading to performance degradation due to insufficient exploitation of potential CoT. In this paper, we propose a Contrastive learning with annotated CoT-based Reinforced Fine-Tuning approach, i.e., \TheName{}, to enhance the reasoning performance of LLMs while addressing the aforementioned limitations. Specifically, we propose learning a representation for each CoT. Based on this representation, we design novel contrastive signals to guide the fine-tuning process. Our approach not only fully exploits the available annotated CoT but also stabilizes the fine-tuning procedure by incorporating an additional unsupervised learning signal. We conduct comprehensive experiments and in-depth analysis with three baseline approaches, two foundation models, and two datasets to demonstrate significant advantages of \TheName{} in terms of robustness, performance (up to 10.15\%), and efficiency (up to 30.62\%).

| **[Barlow-Swin: Toward a novel siamese-based segmentation architecture using Swin-Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06885v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows, particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks, their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep, computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy: Efficient Estimation of Segmentation Quality without Ground-Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04522v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the quality of automatic image segmentation is crucial in clinical practice, but often very challenging due to the limited availability of ground truth annotations. In this paper, we introduce In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy (In-Context RCA), a novel framework for automatically estimating segmentation quality in the absence of ground-truth annotations. By leveraging recent in-context learning segmentation models and incorporating retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images, our approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data. Validated across diverse medical imaging modalities, our method demonstrates robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential.

| **[Text4Seg++: Advancing Image Segmentation via Generative Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06321v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks. To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the MLLM framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our conference paper arXiv:2410.09855</p></details> |
| **[MedSeqFT: Sequential Fine-tuning Foundation Models for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06096v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies, however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore, evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks. Code will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DiffOSeg: Omni Medical Image Segmentation via Multi-Expert Collaboration Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13087v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic ``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

| **[Dual Interaction Network with Cross-Image Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05953v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations. The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference, enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement, outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tbwa233/Probabilistic-SAM/.</p></details> | Preprint |

Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations. To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases. The dataset is available at https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |
| **[MeshMetrics: A Precise Implementation of Distance-Based Image Segmentation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05670v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former, the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention. Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package, available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.</p></details> |  |

For intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where accurate scene understanding is critical for safety and efficiency, this new paradigm offers unprecedented capabilities. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of LLM-augmented image segmentation, focusing on its applications, challenges, and future directions within ITS.

It comprises approximately 110,000 X-ray images of 10 knee implant pair combinations (2 femur and 5 tibia implants) captured during 1,600 trials, incorporating poses associated with daily activities such as level gait and ramp descent.

| **[Depthwise-Dilated Convolutional Adapters for Medical Object Tracking and Segmentation Using the Segment Anything Model 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14613v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community.

| **[Towards Efficient Pixel Labeling for Industrial Anomaly Detection and Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05034v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD) frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC = 99.1\% on MVTec AD).</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Self-Driving Segmentation in Adverse Weather Conditions: A Dual Uncertainty-Aware Training Approach to SAM Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04735v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging, where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases, we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter (UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts. We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets. Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather, while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Unlabeled Structures through Task Consistency Training for Versatile Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04732v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Versatile medical image segmentation (VMIS) targets the segmentation of multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-Scale Volume Priors with Wasserstein-Based Consistency for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04273v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite signi cant progress in semi-supervised medical image segmentation, most existing segmentation networks overlook e ective methodological guidance for feature extraction and important prior information from datasets. In this paper, we develop a semi-supervised medical image segmentation framework that e ectively integrates spatial regularization methods and volume priors. Speci cally, our approach integrates a strong explicit volume prior at the image scale and Threshold Dynamics spatial regularization, both derived from variational models, into the backbone segmentation network. The target region volumes for each unlabeled image are estimated by a regression network, which e ectively regularizes the backbone segmentation network through an image-scale Wasserstein distance constraint, ensuring that the class ratios in the segmentation results for each unlabeled image match those predicted by the regression network. Additionally, we design a dataset-scale Wasserstein distance loss function based on a weak implicit volume prior, which enforces that the volume distribution predicted for the unlabeled dataset is similar to that of labeled dataset. Experimental results on the 2017 ACDC dataset, PROMISE12 dataset, and thigh muscle MR image dataset show the superiority of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |

In LML, the majority class of instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to train a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using the majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications, including pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer sentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a Counting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by counting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis experiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high proportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we developed a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the proportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within the bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on four datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirmed the effectiveness of each module.

While models configured by nnU-Net perform well, they are large and slow, thus limiting real-time use. We identified the most effective components of nnU-Net for cardiac segmentation through an ablation study, incrementally evaluating data augmentation schemes, architectural modifications, loss functions, and post-processing techniques. Our analysis revealed that simple affine augmentations and deep supervision drive performance, while complex augmentations and large model capacity offer diminishing returns. Based on these insights, we developed a lightweight U-Net (2M vs 33M parameters) that achieves statistically equivalent performance to nnU-Net on CAMUS (N=500) with Dice scores of 0.93/0.85/0.89 vs 0.93/0.86/0.89 for LV/MYO/LA ($p>0.05$), while being 16 times smaller and 4 times faster (1.35ms vs 5.40ms per frame) than the default nnU-Net configuration.

Convolutional neural networks, while effective, are constrained by limited receptive fields and thus struggle to model long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers capture global context, yet their quadratic complexity and large parameter budgets hinder use on the small-sample medical datasets common in dermatology. We introduce the MedLiteNet, a lightweight CNN Transformer hybrid tailored for dermoscopic segmentation that achieves high precision through hierarchical feature extraction and multi-scale context aggregation. The encoder stacks depth-wise Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between resolutions, and embeds a boundary-aware self-attention module to sharpen lesion contours.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPENet: Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network for Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02993v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image, overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE) module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI2025</p></details> |

While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation.

| **[MSA2-Net: Utilizing Self-Adaptive Convolution Module to Extract Multi-Scale Information in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01498v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The nnUNet segmentation framework adeptly adjusts most hyperparameters in training scripts automatically, but it overlooks the tuning of internal hyperparameters within the segmentation network itself, which constrains the model's ability to generalize. Addressing this limitation, this study presents a novel Self-Adaptive Convolution Module that dynamically adjusts the size of the convolution kernels depending on the unique fingerprints of different datasets. This adjustment enables the MSA2-Net, when equipped with this module, to proficiently capture both global and local features within the feature maps. Self-Adaptive Convolution Module is strategically integrated into two key components of the MSA2-Net: the Multi-Scale Convolution Bridge and the Multi-Scale Amalgamation Decoder. In the MSConvBridge, the module enhances the ability to refine outputs from various stages of the CSWin Transformer during the skip connections, effectively eliminating redundant data that could potentially impair the decoder's performance. Simultaneously, the MSADecoder, utilizing the module, excels in capturing detailed information of organs varying in size during the decoding phase. This capability ensures that the decoder's output closely reproduces the intricate details within the feature maps, thus yielding highly accurate segmentation images. MSA2-Net, bolstered by this advanced architecture, has demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving Dice coefficient scores of 86.49\%, 92.56\%, 93.37\%, and 92.98\% on the Synapse, ACDC, Kvasir, and Skin Lesion Segmentation (ISIC2017) datasets, respectively. This underscores MSA2-Net's robustness and precision in medical image segmentation tasks across various datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mix-modal Federated Learning for MRI Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02541v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) image segmentation is crucial in diagnosing and treating many diseases, such as brain tumors. Existing MRI image segmentation methods mainly fall into a centralized multimodal paradigm, which is inapplicable in engineering non-centralized mix-modal medical scenarios. In this situation, each distributed client (hospital) processes multiple mixed MRI modalities, and the modality set and image data for each client are diverse, suffering from extensive client-wise modality heterogeneity and data heterogeneity. In this paper, we first formulate non-centralized mix-modal MRI image segmentation as a new paradigm for federated learning (FL) that involves multiple modalities, called mix-modal federated learning (MixMFL). It distinguishes from existing multimodal federating learning (MulMFL) and cross-modal federating learning (CroMFL) paradigms. Then, we proposed a novel modality decoupling and memorizing mix-modal federated learning framework (MDM-MixMFL) for MRI image segmentation, which is characterized by a modality decoupling strategy and a modality memorizing mechanism. Specifically, the modality decoupling strategy disentangles each modality into modality-tailored and modality-shared information. During mix-modal federated updating, corresponding modality encoders undergo tailored and shared updating, respectively. It facilitates stable and adaptive federating aggregation of heterogeneous data and modalities from distributed clients. Besides, the modality memorizing mechanism stores client-shared modality prototypes dynamically refreshed from every modality-tailored encoder to compensate for incomplete modalities in each local client. It further benefits modality aggregation and fusion processes during mixmodal federated learning. Extensive experiments on two public datasets for MRI image segmentation demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Noisy Labels to Intrinsic Structure: A Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Framework for Noise-Robust Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02419v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The effectiveness of convolutional neural networks in medical image segmentation relies on large-scale, high-quality annotations, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Even expert-labeled datasets inevitably contain noise arising from subjectivity and coarse delineations, which disrupt feature learning and adversely impact model performance. To address these challenges, this study propose a Geometric-Structural Dual-Guided Network (GSD-Net), which integrates geometric and structural cues to improve robustness against noisy annotations. It incorporates a Geometric Distance-Aware module that dynamically adjusts pixel-level weights using geometric features, thereby strengthening supervision in reliable regions while suppressing noise. A Structure-Guided Label Refinement module further refines labels with structural priors, and a Knowledge Transfer module enriches supervision and improves sensitivity to local details. To comprehensively assess its effectiveness, we evaluated GSD-Net on six publicly available datasets: four containing three types of simulated label noise, and two with multi-expert annotations that reflect real-world subjectivity and labeling inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that GSD-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance under noisy annotations, achieving improvements of 2.52% on Kvasir, 22.76% on Shenzhen, 8.87% on BU-SUC, and 4.59% on BraTS2020 under SR simulated noise.

Partial differential equations (PDE)-based methods have proven to show reliable results when incorporated in both denoising and segmentation of images. In our work, we discuss a multi-stage PDE-based image processing approach. It relies upon the nonlinear diffusion for noise removal and clustering and region growing for segmentation. In the first stage of the approach, the raw image is computed from noisy measurement data. The second stage aims to filter out the noise using anisotropic diffusion. We couple these stages into one optimisation problem which allows us to incorporate a diffusion coefficient based on a presegmented image. The third stage performs the final segmentation of the image. We demonstrate our approach on both images for which the ground truth is known and on MR measurements made by an experimental, inexpensive scanner.</p></details> | 24 pages, 7 figures |

To address this, an adaptive Co-Kriging-assisted multi-fidelity multi-objective NAS algorithm is proposed to further reduce the computational cost of NAS by incorporating a clustering-based local multi-fidelity infill sampling strategy, enabling efficient exploration of the search space for faster convergence. This algorithm is further accelerated by the use of a novel continuous encoding method to represent the connections of nodes in each cell within a generalized cell-based U-Net backbone, thereby decreasing the search dimension (number of variables). Results indicate that the proposed NAS algorithm outperforms previously published state-of-the-art methods under limited computational budget on three numerical benchmarks, a 2D Darcy flow regression problem and a CHASE_DB1 biomedical image segmentation problem. The proposed method is subsequently used to create a wind velocity regression model with application in urban modelling, with the found model able to achieve good prediction with less computational complexity. Further analysis revealed that the NAS algorithm independently identified principles undergirding superior U-Net architectures in other literature, such as the importance of allowing each cell to incorporate information from prior cells.</p></details> |  |

However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once (YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR) steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%, especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model, particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as input.</p></details> |  |

Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy. Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions.

Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2) MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently, enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video. Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its strong generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

However, the prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000 instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images). Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE) module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene: pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can balance the need for additional sensors or training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

To address this, we introduce StripDet, a novel lightweight framework designed for on-device efficiency. First, we propose the novel Strip Attention Block (SAB), a highly efficient module designed to capture long-range spatial dependencies. By decomposing standard 2D convolutions into asymmetric strip convolutions, SAB efficiently extracts directional features while reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear. Second, we design a hardware-friendly hierarchical backbone that integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a superior accuracy-efficiency trade-off while establishing itself as a practical solution for real-world 3D detection on edge devices.</p></details> |  |

In ego-motion estimation, the visual-inertial setup is commonly adopted due to complementary characteristics between sensors (e.g., scale perception and low drift). For optimal event-based visual-inertial fusion, accurate spatiotemporal (extrinsic and temporal) calibration is required. In this work, we present eKalibr-Inertial, an accurate spatiotemporal calibrator for event-based visual-inertial systems, utilizing the widely used circle grid board. Building upon the grid pattern recognition and tracking methods in eKalibr and eKalibr-Stereo, the proposed method starts with a rigorous and efficient initialization, where all parameters in the estimator would be accurately recovered. Subsequently, a continuous-time-based batch optimization is conducted to refine the initialized parameters toward better states. The results of extensive real-world experiments show that eKalibr-Inertial can achieve accurate event-based visual-inertial spatiotemporal calibration. The implementation of eKalibr-Inertial is open-sourced at (https://github.com/Unsigned-Long/eKalibr) to benefit the research community.</p></details> |  |

Integrative Turing-like tests for Language and Vision Demonstrate a Narrowing Gap](http://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13087v3)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As AI becomes increasingly embedded in daily life, ascertaining whether an agent is human is critical. We systematically benchmark AI's ability to imitate humans in three language tasks (image captioning, word association, conversation) and three vision tasks (color estimation, object detection, attention prediction), collecting data from 636 humans and 37 AI agents. Next, we conducted 72,191 Turing-like tests with 1,916 human judges and 10 AI judges. Current AIs are approaching the ability to convincingly impersonate humans and deceive human judges in both language and vision. Even simple AI judges outperformed humans in distinguishing AI from human responses. Imitation ability showed minimal correlation with conventional AI performance metrics, suggesting that passing as human is an important independent evaluation criterion. The large-scale Turing datasets and metrics introduced here offer valuable benchmarks for assessing human-likeness in AI and highlight the importance of rigorous, quantitative imitation tests for AI development.</p></details> | <details><summary>83 pa...</summary><p>83 pages, 4 main figures, 17 supp figures, and 4 supp tables</p></details> |
| **[CRAB: Camera-Radar Fusion for Reducing Depth Ambiguity in Backward Projection based View Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05785v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB (Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in 3D object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICRA 2025</p></details> |

Albeit efficient, PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations, narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First, we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using 3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively, and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and ``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5, 43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8 milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m) struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5 values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions, addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform adequately.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sense4FL: Vehicular Crowdsensing Enhanced Federated Learning for Object Detection in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17697v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To accommodate constantly changing road conditions, real-time vision model training is essential for autonomous driving (AD). Federated learning (FL) serves as a promising paradigm to enable autonomous vehicles to train models collaboratively with their onboard computing resources. However, existing vehicle selection schemes for FL all assume predetermined and location-independent vehicles' datasets, neglecting the fact that vehicles collect training data along their routes, thereby resulting in suboptimal vehicle selection. In this paper, we focus on the fundamental perception problem and propose Sense4FL, a vehicular crowdsensing-enhanced FL framework featuring \textit{trajectory-dependent} vehicular \textit{training data collection} to \rev{improve the object detection quality} in AD for a region. To this end, we first derive the convergence bound of FL by considering the impact of both vehicles' uncertain trajectories and uploading probabilities, from which we discover that minimizing the training loss is equivalent to minimizing a weighted sum of local and global earth mover's distance (EMD) between vehicles' collected data distribution and global data distribution. Based on this observation, we formulate the trajectory-dependent vehicle selection and data collection problem for FL in AD. Given that the problem is NP-hard, we develop an efficient algorithm to find the solution with an approximation guarantee. Extensive simulation results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in improving object detection performance compared with existing benchmarks.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Quaternion Approximation Networks for Enhanced Image Classification and Oriented Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05512v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO, DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware perception and application in other domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2025</p></details> |

While standard methods employ a frame-based, multi-label approach, we introduce an onset-based detection method which we name Voxaboxen. It takes inspiration from object detection methods in computer vision, but simultaneously takes advantage of recent advances in self-supervised audio encoders. For each time window, Voxaboxen predicts whether it contains the start of a vocalization and how long the vocalization is. It also does the same in reverse, predicting whether each window contains the end of a vocalization, and how long ago it started. The two resulting sets of bounding boxes are then fused using a graph-matching algorithm. We also release a new dataset designed to measure performance on detecting overlapping vocalizations. This consists of recordings of zebra finches annotated with temporally-strong labels and showing frequent overlaps. We test Voxaboxen on seven existing data sets and on our new data set. We compare Voxaboxen to natural baselines and existing sound event detection methods and demonstrate SotA results. Further experiments show that improvements are robust to frequent vocalization overlap.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Analysis of Layer-Freezing Strategies for Enhanced Transfer Learning in YOLO Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05490v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth, dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but, rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical, evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in scenarios with limited resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 14 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Existing methods are confined to closed-set settings, where the training and testing sets consist of the same scenes and/or object categories. However, real-world applications often introduce new environments and novel object categories, posing a challenge to these methods. In this paper, we address monocular 3D object detection in an open-set setting and introduce the first end-to-end 3D Monocular Open-set Object Detector (3D-MOOD). We propose to lift the open-set 2D detection into 3D space through our designed 3D bounding box head, enabling end-to-end joint training for both 2D and 3D tasks to yield better overall performance. We condition the object queries with geometry prior and overcome the generalization for 3D estimation across diverse scenes. To further improve performance, we design the canonical image space for more efficient cross-dataset training. We evaluate 3D-MOOD on both closed-set settings (Omni3D) and open-set settings (Omni3D to Argoverse 2, ScanNet), and achieve new state-of-the-art results.

| **[A biologically inspired separable learning vision model for real-time traffic object perception in Dark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05012v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover, there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components: a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1 percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at https://github.com/alanli1997/slvm.</p></details> |  |
| **[YOLOv13: Real-Time Object Detection with Hypergraph-Enhanced Adaptive Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17733v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The YOLO series models reign supreme in real-time object detection due to their superior accuracy and computational efficiency. However, both the convolutional architectures of YOLO11 and earlier versions and the area-based self-attention mechanism introduced in YOLOv12 are limited to local information aggregation and pairwise correlation modeling, lacking the capability to capture global multi-to-multi high-order correlations, which limits detection performance in complex scenarios. In this paper, we propose YOLOv13, an accurate and lightweight object detector. To address the above-mentioned challenges, we propose a Hypergraph-based Adaptive Correlation Enhancement (HyperACE) mechanism that adaptively exploits latent high-order correlations and overcomes the limitation of previous methods that are restricted to pairwise correlation modeling based on hypergraph computation, achieving efficient global cross-location and cross-scale feature fusion and enhancement. Subsequently, we propose a Full-Pipeline Aggregation-and-Distribution (FullPAD) paradigm based on HyperACE, which effectively achieves fine-grained information flow and representation synergy within the entire network by distributing correlation-enhanced features to the full pipeline. Finally, we propose to leverage depthwise separable convolutions to replace vanilla large-kernel convolutions, and design a series of blocks that significantly reduce parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing performance. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely used MS COCO benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters and FLOPs. Specifically, our YOLOv13-N improves mAP by 3.0\% over YOLO11-N and by 1.5\% over YOLOv12-N.

Existing methods based on vision transformers (ViTs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) architectures aim to leverage both global and local features, but the difficulty in effectively integrating these heterogeneous features limits their overall performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a graph-enhanced contextual and regional perception network (GCRPNet), which builds upon the Mamba architecture to simultaneously capture long-range dependencies and enhance regional feature representation. Specifically, we employ the visual state space (VSS) encoder to extract multi-scale features. To further achieve deep guidance and enhancement of these features, we first design a difference-similarity guided hierarchical graph attention module (DS-HGAM). This module strengthens cross-layer interaction capabilities between features of different scales while enhancing the model's structural perception,allowing it to distinguish between foreground and background more effectively. Then, we design the LEVSS block as the decoder of GCRPNet. This module integrates our proposed adaptive scanning strategy and multi-granularity collaborative attention enhancement module (MCAEM). It performs adaptive patch scanning on feature maps processed via multi-scale convolutions, thereby capturing rich local region information and enhancing Mamba's local modeling capability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and superiority.</p></details> |  |

Surveillance cameras are often installed around buildings to detect falling objects, but such detection remains challenging due to the small size and fast motion of the objects. Moreover, the field of falling object detection around buildings (FODB) lacks a large-scale dataset for training learning-based detection methods and for standardized evaluation. To address these challenges, we propose a large and diverse video benchmark dataset named FADE. Specifically, FADE contains 2,611 videos from 25 scenes, featuring 8 falling object categories, 4 weather conditions, and 4 video resolutions. Additionally, we develop a novel detection method for FODB that effectively leverages motion information and generates small-sized yet high-quality detection proposals.

This task is critically important to marine ecology.

Despite numerous efforts devoted, mainstream detectors still underperform in such scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce RS-TinyNet, a multi-stage feature fusion and enhancement model explicitly tailored for RS tiny object detection in various RS scenarios. RS-TinyNet comes with two novel designs: tiny object saliency modeling and feature integrity reconstruction. Guided by these principles, we design three step-wise feature enhancement modules. Among them, the multi-dimensional collaborative attention (MDCA) module employs multi-dimensional attention to enhance the saliency of tiny objects. Additionally, the auxiliary reversible branch (ARB) and a progressive fusion detection head (PFDH) module are introduced to preserve information flow and fuse multi-level features to bridge semantic gaps and retain structural detail. Comprehensive experiments on public RS dataset AI-TOD show that our RS-TinyNet surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors by 4.0% AP and 6.5% AP75. Evaluations on DIOR benchmark dataset further validate its superior detection performance in diverse RS scenarios. These results demonstrate that the proposed multi-stage feature fusion strategy offers an effective and practical solution for tiny object detection in complex RS environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The content of the thesis requires supplementation to make it more substantial</p></details> |

However, different vehicle platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the diverse vehicle platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective, generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection. Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches, DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data. A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks. Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art segmentation networks are typically developed and tuned on ground-perspective photographs and do not directly address remote sensing challenges such as extreme scale variation, foreground-background imbalance, and large image sizes. We explore the incorporation of the differential morphological profile (DMP), a multi-scale shape extraction method based on grayscale morphology, into modern segmentation networks. Prior studies have shown that the DMP can provide critical shape information to Deep Neural Networks to enable superior detection and classification performance in overhead imagery. In this work, we extend prior DMPNet work beyond classification and object detection by integrating DMP features into three state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer semantic segmentation architectures. We utilize both direct input, which adapts the input stem of feature extraction architectures to accept DMP channels, and hybrid architectures, a dual-stream design that fuses RGB and DMP encoders. Using the iSAID benchmark dataset, we evaluate a variety of DMP differentials and structuring element shapes to more effectively provide shape information to the model. Our results show that while non-DMP models generally outperform the direct-input variants, hybrid DMP consistently outperforms direct-input and is capable of surpassing a non-DMP model on mIoU, F1, and Recall.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

To solve this inverse problem, we assume that interior velocity measurements are available only within a localized subregion of the fluid domain. First, we present an identifiability result. We then formulate the problem as a shape optimization task: to identify the obstacle, we minimize a nonlinear least-squares criterion with a regularization term that penalizes the perimeter of the obstacle to be identified. We prove the existence and stability of a minimizer of the least-squares functional. To recover the unknown obstacle, we present a non-iterative identification method based on the topological derivative. The corresponding asymptotic expansion of the least-squares functional is computed in a straightforward manner using a penalty method. Finally, as a realistic application, we demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed non-iterative procedure through numerical experiments using the INSTMCOTRHD ocean model, which incorporates realistic Mediterranean bathymetry, stratification, and forcing conditions.</p></details> |  |

Annotation is usually a labor-intensive step that require associating labels ranging from a simple classification label to more complex tasks such as object detection, oriented bounding box estimation, and instance segmentation. Traditional tools often require extensive manual input, limiting scalability for large datasets. To address this, we introduce VisioFirm, an open-source web application designed to streamline image labeling through AI-assisted automation. VisioFirm integrates state-of-the-art foundation models into an interface with a filtering pipeline to reduce human-in-the-loop efforts. This hybrid approach employs CLIP combined with pre-trained detectors like Ultralytics models for common classes and zero-shot models such as Grounding DINO for custom labels, generating initial annotations with low-confidence thresholding to maximize recall. Through this framework, when tested on COCO-type of classes, initial prediction have been proven to be mostly correct though the users can refine these via interactive tools supporting bounding boxes, oriented bounding boxes, and polygons. Additionally, VisioFirm has on-the-fly segmentation powered by Segment Anything accelerated through WebGPU for browser-side efficiency. The tool supports multiple export formats (YOLO, COCO, Pascal VOC, CSV) and operates offline after model caching, enhancing accessibility. VisioFirm demonstrates up to 90\% reduction in manual effort through benchmarks on diverse datasets, while maintaining high annotation accuracy via clustering of connected CLIP-based disambiguate components and IoU-graph for redundant detection suppression. VisioFirm can be accessed from \href{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}{https://github.com/OschAI/VisioFirm}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Object Detection and Associated Hardware Accelerators Targeting Autonomous Vehicles: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04173v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The efficiency of object detectors depends on factors like detection accuracy, processing time, and computational resources. Processing time is crucial for real-time applications, particularly for autonomous vehicles (AVs), where instantaneous responses are vital for safety. This review paper provides a concise yet comprehensive survey of real-time object detection (OD) algorithms for autonomous cars delving into their hardware accelerators (HAs). Non-neural network-based algorithms, which use statistical image processing, have been entirely substituted by AI algorithms, such as different models of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Their intrinsically parallel features led them to be deployable into edge-based HAs of various types, where GPUs and, to a lesser extent, ASIC (application-specific integrated circuit) remain the most widely used. Throughputs of hundreds of frames/s (fps) could be reached; however, handling object detection for all the cameras available in a typical AV requires further hardware and algorithmic improvements. The intensive competition between AV providers has limited the disclosure of algorithms, firmware, and even hardware platform details. This remains a hurdle for researchers, as commercial systems provide valuable insights while academics undergo lengthy training and testing on restricted datasets and road scenarios. Consequently, many AV research papers may not be reflected in end products, being developed under limited conditions. This paper surveys state-of-the-art OD algorithms and aims to bridge the gap with technologies in commercial AVs. To our knowledge, this aspect has not been addressed in earlier surveys. Hence, the paper serves as a tangible reference for researchers designing future generations of vehicles, expected to be fully autonomous for comfort and safety.</p></details> |  |

However, their high computational complexity, large memory footprints, and irregular data access patterns present significant challenges for deployment in latency- and power-constrained environments. Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) provide an attractive hardware platform for such workloads due to their reconfigurability, fine-grained parallelism, and potential for energy-efficient acceleration. This paper presents a comprehensive review of design trade-offs, optimization strategies, and implementation challenges for FPGA-based inference of transformers and VLMs. We examine critical factors such as device-class selection, memory subsystem constraints, dataflow orchestration, quantization strategies, sparsity exploitation, and toolchain choices, alongside modality-specific issues unique to VLMs, including heterogeneous compute balancing and cross-attention memory management. Additionally, we discuss emerging trends in hardware-algorithm co-design, highlighting innovations in attention mechanisms, compression, and modular overlays to improve efficiency and adaptability. Practical issues such as runtime flexibility, verification overhead, and the absence of standardized FPGA multimodal benchmarks are also considered. Finally, we outline future directions toward scalable, portable, and reconfigurable FPGA solutions that adapt to evolving model architectures while sustaining high utilization and predictable performance. This synthesis offers both a technical foundation and a forward-looking perspective to help bridge the gap between advanced multimodal AI models and efficient FPGA deployment.</p></details> |  |

In addition, we extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.</p></details> |  |

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods.

We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA. Given offline detections, our algorithm tracks at 250+ fps on a single laptop CPU. Code is available at https://github.com/hwcao17/pkf.</p></details> |  |

In this study, a novel benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers. The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, dataset available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBARI-org/DeepSea-MOT</p></details> |

Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections.</p></details> | BMVC2025 poster |
| **[See No Evil: Adversarial Attacks Against Linguistic-Visual Association in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02028v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[ADVMEM: Adversarial Memory Initialization for Realistic Test-Time Adaptation via Tracklet-Based Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02182v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[NOOUGAT: Towards Unified Online and Offline Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02111v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline} Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios. Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeatureSORT: Essential Features for Effective Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04249v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FeatureSORT, a simple yet effective online multiple object tracker that reinforces the DeepSORT baseline with a redesigned detector and additional feature cues. In contrast to conventional detectors that only provide bounding boxes, our modified YOLOX architecture is extended to output multiple appearance attributes, including clothing color, clothing style, and motion direction, alongside the bounding boxes. These feature cues, together with a ReID network, form complementary embeddings that substantially improve association accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate stronger post-processing strategies, such as global linking and Gaussian Smoothing Process interpolation, to handle missing associations and detections. During online tracking, we define a measurement-to-track distance function that jointly considers IoU, direction, color, style, and ReID similarity. This design enables FeatureSORT to maintain consistent identities through longer occlusions while reducing identity switches. Extensive experiments on standard MOT benchmarks demonstrate that FeatureSORT achieves state-of-the-art online performance, with MOTA scores of 79.7 on MOT16, 80.6 on MOT17, 77.9 on MOT20, and 92.2 on DanceTrack, underscoring the effectiveness of feature-enriched detection and modular post processing in advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training. In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches.

This paper presents algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges using Lidar sensor data, emphasizing ensemble Kalman filter. The developed predictive collision avoidance algorithm employs the data provided by lidar sensors to track multiple objects and predict their velocities and future positions, enabling the AMR to navigate safely and effectively. A modification to the dynamic windowing approach is introduced to enhance the performance of the collision avoidance system. The overall system architecture encompasses object detection, multi-object tracking, and predictive collision avoidance control. The experimental results, obtained from both simulation and real-world data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, which lays the foundation for future research on global planners, other controllers, and the integration of additional sensors.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Springer International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> |

The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 28th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)</p></details> |
| **[Multiple Object Detection and Tracking in Panoramic Videos for Cycling Safety Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15199v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyclists face a disproportionate risk of injury, yet conventional crash records are too limited to reconstruct the circumstances of incidents or to diagnose risk at the finer spatial and temporal detail needed for targeted interventions. Recently, naturalistic studies have gained traction as a way to capture the complex behavioural and infrastructural factors that contribute to crashes. These approaches typically involve the collection and analysis of video data. A video promising format is panoramic video, which can record 360-degree views around a rider. However, its use is limited by severe distortions, large numbers of small objects and boundary continuity. This study addresses these challenges by proposing a novel three-step framework: (1) enhancing object detection accuracy on panoramic imagery by segmenting and projecting the original 360-degree images into four perspective sub-images, thus reducing distortion; (2) modifying multi-object tracking models to incorporate boundary continuity and object category information for improved tracking consistency; and (3) validating the proposed approach through a real-world application focused on detecting overtaking manoeuvres by vehicles around cyclists. The methodology is evaluated using panoramic videos recorded by cyclists on London's roadways under diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate notable improvements over baseline methods, achieving higher average precision across varying image resolutions. Moreover, the enhanced tracking approach yields a 3.0% increase in multi-object tracking accuracy and a 4.6% improvement in identification F-score. The overtaking detection task achieves a high F-score of 0.81, illustrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world cycling safety scenarios.

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball.

However, this aspect of the problem is mostly overlooked or mitigated by employing two-stage association and utilizing low confidence detections in the second stage. Recently proposed BoostTrack attempts to avoid the drawbacks of multiple stage association approach and use low-confidence detections by applying detection confidence boosting. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the confidence boost used in BoostTrack and propose a method to improve its performance. To construct a richer similarity measure and enable a better selection of true positive detections, we propose to use a combination of shape, Mahalanobis distance and novel soft BIoU similarity. We propose a soft detection confidence boost technique which calculates new confidence scores based on the similarity measure and the previous confidence scores, and we introduce varying similarity threshold to account for lower similarity measure between detections and tracklets which are not regularly updated. The proposed additions are mutually independent and can be used in any MOT algorithm. Combined with the BoostTrack+ baseline, our method achieves near state of the art results on the MOT17 dataset and new state of the art HOTA and IDF1 scores on the MOT20 dataset.

| **[6-DoF Object Tracking with Event-based Optical Flow and Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14776v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range, that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |

Despite doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles, previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format of the fast racket sport.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first comprehensive survey for multi-modal visual object tracking; 6 multi-modal tasks; 338 references</p></details> |

However, this efficiency often compromises the expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG) and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD) design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on the GOT-10K dataset.

| **[Interleaving Reasoning for Better Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06945v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL), which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF, GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .</p></details> |  |
| **[TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06499v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at https://github.com/KomJay520/TIDE.</p></details> |  |

This review provides a comprehensive synthesis of recent progress in the field, organized into four key domains: image generation, text generation, molecular profile-morphology generation, and other specialized generation applications. By analyzing over 150 representative studies, we trace the evolution of content generation architectures -- from early generative adversarial networks to recent advances in diffusion models and generative vision-language models. We further examine the datasets and evaluation protocols commonly used in this domain and highlight ongoing limitations, including challenges in generating high-fidelity whole slide images, clinical interpretability, and concerns related to the ethical and legal implications of synthetic data. The review concludes with a discussion of open challenges and prospective research directions, with an emphasis on developing integrated and clinically deployable generation systems.

While these models have shown promising performance, concerns have been raised regarding the potential misuse of the generated fake images. In response to this, we have presented a simple yet effective training-free method to attribute fake images generated by text-to-image models to their source models. Given a test image to be attributed, we first inverse the textual prompt of the image, and then put the reconstructed prompt into different candidate models to regenerate candidate fake images. By calculating and ranking the similarity of the test image and the candidate images, we can determine the source of the image. This attribution allows model owners to be held accountable for any misuse of their models. Note that our approach does not limit the number of candidate text-to-image generative models. Comprehensive experiments reveal that (1) Our method can effectively attribute fake images to their source models, achieving comparable attribution performance with the state-of-the-art method; (2) Our method has high scalability ability, which is well adapted to real-world attribution scenarios. (3) The proposed method yields satisfactory robustness to common attacks, such as Gaussian blurring, JPEG compression, and Resizing. We also analyze the factors that influence the attribution performance, and explore the boost brought by the proposed method as a plug-in to improve the performance of existing SOTA. We hope our work can shed some light on the solutions to addressing the source of AI-generated images, as well as to prevent the misuse of text-to-image generative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been withdrawn by the authors because the proposed approach is currently undergoing optimization and improvement.

We then introduce a probabilistic framework that emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and copyright and IP.

Recent research indicates that the learned semantic concepts of pre-trained models are critical for identifying fake images. However, the misalignment between the forgery and semantic concept spaces hinders the model's forgery detection performance. To address this problem, we propose a novel Semantic Discrepancy-aware Detector (SDD) that leverages reconstruction learning to align the two spaces at a fine-grained visual level. By exploiting the conceptual knowledge embedded in the pre-trained vision language model, we specifically design a semantic token sampling module to mitigate the space shifts caused by features irrelevant to both forgery traces and semantic concepts. A concept-level forgery discrepancy learning module, built upon a visual reconstruction paradigm, is proposed to strengthen the interaction between visual semantic concepts and forgery traces, effectively capturing discrepancies under the concepts' guidance. Finally, the low-level forgery feature enhancemer integrates the learned concept level forgery discrepancies to minimize redundant forgery information. Experiments conducted on two standard image forgery datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed SDD, which achieves superior results compared to existing methods.

HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090 GPUs, representing a significant reduction in computational requirements compared to traditional approaches. Our key contributions include: (1) Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), a novel U-shape transformer, Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), that employs cross-attention for skip connections, providing superior feature integration that leads to remarkable compositional consistency; (2) a comprehensive training recipe that incorporates TREAD acceleration, a novel shifted square crop strategy for efficient arbitrary aspect-ratio training, and progressive resolution scaling; and (3) an empirical demonstration that smaller models (343M parameters) with carefully crafted architectures can achieve high-quality results and emergent capabilities, such as intuitive camera control. Our work provides an alternative paradigm of scaling, demonstrating a viable path toward democratizing high-quality text-to-image generation for individual researchers and smaller organizations with limited computational resources.</p></details> |  |

This makes them highly promising for image reconstruction, where the goal is to recover a clean image from a degraded observation. In this work, we introduce a conditional sampling framework that leverages the powerful priors learned by diffusion models while enforcing consistency with the available measurements. To further adapt pre-trained diffusion models to the specific degradation at hand, we propose a novel fine-tuning strategy. In particular, we employ LoRA-based adaptation using images that are semantically and visually similar to the degraded input, efficiently retrieved from a large and diverse dataset via an off-the-shelf vision-language model.

Critically, comparable pretrained foundation models do not exist for 3D, significantly limiting progress in this domain. As a result, the potential of vision-language models to produce high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images conditioned solely on natural language descriptions remains completely unexplored. Addressing this gap would enable powerful clinical and research applications, such as personalized counterfactual explanations, simulation of disease progression scenarios, and enhanced medical training by visualizing hypothetical medical conditions in realistic detail. Our work takes a meaningful step toward addressing this challenge by introducing a framework capable of generating high-resolution 3D counterfactual medical images of synthesized patients guided by free-form language prompts. We adapt state-of-the-art 3D diffusion models with enhancements from Simple Diffusion and incorporate augmented conditioning to improve text alignment and image quality. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of a language-guided native-3D diffusion model applied specifically to neurological imaging data, where faithful three-dimensional modeling is essential to represent the brain's three-dimensional structure. Through results on two distinct neurological MRI datasets, our framework successfully simulates varying counterfactual lesion loads in Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and cognitive states in Alzheimer's disease, generating high-quality images while preserving subject fidelity in synthetically generated medical images. Our results lay the groundwork for prompt-driven disease progression analysis within 3D medical imaging.</p></details> |  |

| **[Test-Time Scaling of Diffusion Models via Noise Trajectory Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03164v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The iterative and stochastic nature of diffusion models enables test-time scaling, whereby spending additional compute during denoising generates higher-fidelity samples. Increasing the number of denoising steps is the primary scaling axis, but this yields quickly diminishing returns. Instead optimizing the noise trajectory--the sequence of injected noise vectors--is promising, as the specific noise realizations critically affect sample quality; but this is challenging due to a high-dimensional search space, complex noise-outcome interactions, and costly trajectory evaluations. We address this by first casting diffusion as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a terminal reward, showing tree-search methods such as Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) to be meaningful but impractical. To balance performance and efficiency, we then resort to a relaxation of MDP, where we view denoising as a sequence of independent contextual bandits. This allows us to introduce an $\epsilon$-greedy search algorithm that globally explores at extreme timesteps and locally exploits during the intermediate steps where de-mixing occurs. Experiments on EDM and Stable Diffusion reveal state-of-the-art scores for class-conditioned/text-to-image generation, exceeding baselines by up to $164\%$ and matching/exceeding MCTS performance. To our knowledge, this is the first practical method for test-time noise trajectory optimization of arbitrary (non-differentiable) rewards.</p></details> |  |

Existing character editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepShade: Enable Shade Simulation by Text-conditioned Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12103v4)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heatwaves pose a significant threat to public health, especially as global warming intensifies. However, current routing systems (e.g., online maps) fail to incorporate shade information due to the difficulty of estimating shades directly from noisy satellite imagery and the limited availability of training data for generative models. In this paper, we address these challenges through two main contributions. First, we build an extensive dataset covering diverse longitude-latitude regions, varying levels of building density, and different urban layouts. Leveraging Blender-based 3D simulations alongside building outlines, we capture building shadows under various solar zenith angles throughout the year and at different times of day. These simulated shadows are aligned with satellite images, providing a rich resource for learning shade patterns. Second, we propose the DeepShade, a diffusion-based model designed to learn and synthesize shade variations over time. It emphasizes the nuance of edge features by jointly considering RGB with the Canny edge layer, and incorporates contrastive learning to capture the temporal change rules of shade. Then, by conditioning on textual descriptions of known conditions (e.g., time of day, solar angles), our framework provides improved performance in generating shade images. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by using our shade predictions to calculate shade ratios for real-world route planning in Tempe, Arizona. We believe this work will benefit society by providing a reference for urban planning in extreme heat weather and its potential practical applications in the environment.</p></details> | 7pages, 4 figures |

However, acquiring sufficient data is often challenging and costly. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models in high-quality image synthesis and advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose a novel framework called LLM-assisted Paired Image Generation (LaPIG). This framework enables the construction of comprehensive, high-quality paired visible and thermal images using captions generated by LLMs. Our method encompasses three parts: visible image synthesis with ArcFace embedding, thermal image translation using Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), and caption generation with LLMs. Our approach not only generates multi-view paired visible and thermal images to increase data diversity but also produces high-quality paired data while maintaining their identity information. We evaluate our method on public datasets by comparing it with existing methods, demonstrating the superiority of LaPIG.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Image Generation to Infrastructure Design: a Multi-agent Pipeline for Street Design Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05469v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation, and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation infrastructure planning and facility design.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi CSI using a pretrained latent diffusion model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10605v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LatentCSI, a novel method for generating images of the physical environment from WiFi CSI measurements that leverages a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). Unlike prior approaches that rely on complex and computationally intensive techniques such as GANs, our method employs a lightweight neural network to map CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of an LDM. We then apply the LDM's denoising diffusion model to the latent representation with text-based guidance before decoding using the LDM's pretrained decoder to obtain a high-resolution image. This design bypasses the challenges of pixel-space image generation and avoids the explicit image encoding stage typically required in conventional image-to-image pipelines, enabling efficient and high-quality image synthesis. We validate our approach on two datasets: a wide-band CSI dataset we collected with off-the-shelf WiFi devices and cameras; and a subset of the publicly available MM-Fi dataset. The results demonstrate that LatentCSI outperforms baselines of comparable complexity trained directly on ground-truth images in both computational efficiency and perceptual quality, while additionally providing practical advantages through its unique capacity for text-guided controllability.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[InfoScale: Unleashing Training-free Variable-scaled Image Generation via Effective Utilization of Information](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01421v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have become dominant in visual generation but suffer performance drop when tested on resolutions that differ from the training scale, whether lower or higher. In fact, the key challenge in generating variable-scale images lies in the differing amounts of information across resolutions, which requires information conversion procedures to be varied for generating variable-scaled images. In this paper, we investigate the issues of three critical aspects in DMs for a unified analysis in variable-scaled generation: dilated convolution, attention mechanisms, and initial noise. Specifically, 1) dilated convolution in DMs for the higher-resolution generation loses high-frequency information. 2) Attention for variable-scaled image generation struggles to adjust the information aggregation adaptively. 3) The spatial distribution of information in the initial noise is misaligned with variable-scaled image. To solve the above problems, we propose \textbf{InfoScale}, an information-centric framework for variable-scaled image generation by effectively utilizing information from three aspects correspondingly. For information loss in 1), we introduce Progressive Frequency Compensation module to compensate for high-frequency information lost by dilated convolution in higher-resolution generation. For information aggregation inflexibility in 2), we introduce Adaptive Information Aggregation module to adaptively aggregate information in lower-resolution generation and achieve an effective balance between local and global information in higher-resolution generation. For information distribution misalignment in 3), we design Noise Adaptation module to re-distribute information in initial noise for variable-scaled generation. Our method is plug-and-play for DMs and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness in variable-scaled image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptGuard: Soft Prompt-Guided Unsafe Content Moderation for Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03544v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions. However, these models are vulnerable to misuse, particularly generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as sexually explicit, violent, political, and disturbing images, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. We further enhance its reliability and helpfulness through a divide-and-conquer strategy, which optimizes category-specific soft prompts and combines them into holistic safety guidance. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 3.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[HypDAE: Hyperbolic Diffusion Autoencoders for Hierarchical Few-shot Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17784v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot image generation aims to generate diverse and high-quality images for an unseen class given only a few examples in that class. A key challenge in this task is balancing category consistency and image diversity, which often compete with each other. Moreover, existing methods offer limited control over the attributes of newly generated images. In this work, we propose Hyperbolic Diffusion Autoencoders (HypDAE), a novel approach that operates in hyperbolic space to capture hierarchical relationships among images from seen categories. By leveraging pre-trained foundation models, HypDAE generates diverse new images for unseen categories with exceptional quality by varying stochastic subcodes or semantic codes. Most importantly, the hyperbolic representation introduces an additional degree of control over semantic diversity through the adjustment of radii within the hyperbolic disk. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate that HypDAE significantly outperforms prior methods by achieving a better balance between preserving category-relevant features and promoting image diversity with limited data. Furthermore, HypDAE offers a highly controllable and interpretable generation process.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Code is available at: https://github.com/lingxiao-li/HypDAE</p></details> |
| **[STADI: Fine-Grained Step-Patch Diffusion Parallelism for Heterogeneous GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04719v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy, demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.</p></details> |  |

Nowadays, practically every industry uses artificial models to automate their operations. To explore their role, we examined three prominent LLMs (OpenAI, GeminiAI, Deepseek) in multiple stages of textile manufacturing (e.g., sustainable choice, cost effectiveness, production planning, etc.). We assessed the models' ability to replicate garment design using certain parameters (fabric construction, shade, weave, silhouette, etc.). We compared the models in terms of different body types and functional purposes (e.g., fashionwear, sportswear) so that designers could evaluate effectiveness before developing actual patterns, make necessary modifications, and conduct fashion forecasting beforehand. To facilitate deeper analysis, we created a custom dataset specifically for fabric image generation and classification. Our analysis revealed that, in terms of fabric construction, the OpenAI DALL-E model integrated with ChatGPT outperformed other models, achieving a lower LPIPS (Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity) score of approximately $0.2$. In fabric classification from images, we found OpenAI offered the best results by breaking down certain factors (e.g., breathability, moisture-wicking, and tactile comfort), achieving approximately $80\%$ accuracy for base construction and $55\%$ for detailed construction. However, our results indicate that Deepseek faced significant challenges in generating and recognizing fabric images. Overall, all the models struggled to recognize complex fabric constructions and intricate designs from images, and relying too much on AI might hinder human creativity. We also observed that all three models performed effectively in providing recommendations and insights for fabric design in textual form.</p></details> |  |
| **[Durian: Dual Reference-guided Portrait Animation with Attribute Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04434v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Durian, the first method for generating portrait animation videos with facial attribute transfer from a given reference image to a target portrait in a zero-shot manner. To enable high-fidelity and spatially consistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference networks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute images into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model using a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the same portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as the target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on these inputs and their corresponding masks. To support the transfer of attributes with varying spatial extent, we propose a mask expansion strategy using keypoint-conditioned image generation for training. In addition, we further augment the attribute and portrait images with spatial and appearance-level transformations to improve robustness to positional misalignment between them. These strategies allow the model to effectively generalize across diverse attributes and in-the-wild reference combinations, despite being trained without explicit triplet supervision. Durian achieves state-of-the-art performance on portrait animation with attribute transfer, and notably, its dual reference design enables multi-attribute composition in a single generation pass without additional training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://hyunsoocha.github.io/durian</p></details> |

However, many prominent open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as Skywork UniPic 2.0.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noisy Label Refinement with Semantically Reliable Synthetic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04298v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic noise in image classification datasets, where visually similar categories are frequently mislabeled, poses a significant challenge to conventional supervised learning approaches. In this paper, we explore the potential of using synthetic images generated by advanced text-to-image models to address this issue. Although these high-quality synthetic images come with reliable labels, their direct application in training is limited by domain gaps and diversity constraints. Unlike conventional approaches, we propose a novel method that leverages synthetic images as reliable reference points to identify and correct mislabeled samples in noisy datasets. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach significantly improves classification accuracy under various noise conditions, especially in challenging scenarios with semantic label noise. Additionally, since our method is orthogonal to existing noise-robust learning techniques, when combined with state-of-the-art noise-robust training methods, it achieves superior performance, improving accuracy by 30% on CIFAR-10 and by 11% on CIFAR-100 under 70% semantic noise, and by 24% on ImageNet-100 under real-world noise conditions.</p></details> | Accepted to ICIP2025 |

However, existing methods use either multi-round training or knowledge within minibatches, posing challenges in finding a favorable coupling strategy for straightening trajectories to few-step generation. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, Straighter trajectories of Flow Matching (StraightFM). It straightens trajectories with the coupling strategy from the entire distribution level. More specifically, during training, StraightFM creates couplings of images and noise via one diffusion model as a coupling prior to straighten trajectories for few-step generation. Our coupling strategy can also integrate with the existing coupling direction from real data to noise, improving image quality in few-step generation. Experimental results on pixel space and latent space show that StraightFM yields attractive samples within 5 steps. Moreover, our unconditional StraightFM is seamlessly compatible with training-free multimodal conditional generation, maintaining high-quality image generation in few steps.</p></details> |  |

Multi-Conditioning for Image Generation via Sketch-Text Pairing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22627v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fashion design is a complex creative process that blends visual and textual expressions. Designers convey ideas through sketches, which define spatial structure and design elements, and textual descriptions, capturing material, texture, and stylistic details. In this paper, we present LOcalized Text and Sketch for fashion image generation (LOTS), an approach for compositional sketch-text based generation of complete fashion outlooks. LOTS leverages a global description with paired localized sketch + text information for conditioning and introduces a novel step-based merging strategy for diffusion adaptation. First, a Modularized Pair-Centric representation encodes sketches and text into a shared latent space while preserving independent localized features; then, a Diffusion Pair Guidance phase integrates both local and global conditioning via attention-based guidance within the diffusion model's multi-step denoising process. To validate our method, we build on Fashionpedia to release Sketchy, the first fashion dataset where multiple text-sketch pairs are provided per image. Quantitative results show LOTS achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance on both global and localized metrics, while qualitative examples and a human evaluation study highlight its unprecedented level of design customization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV25 (Oral).

Existing UCIR methods, which align cross-domain features for the entire image, often struggle with the domain gap, as the object features critical for retrieval are frequently entangled with domain-specific styles. To address this challenge, we propose DUDE, a novel UCIR method building upon feature disentanglement. In brief, DUDE leverages a text-to-image generative model to disentangle object features from domain-specific styles, thus facilitating semantical image retrieval. To further achieve reliable alignment of the disentangled object features, DUDE aligns mutual neighbors from within domains to across domains in a progressive manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUDE achieves state-of-the-art performance across three benchmark datasets over 13 domains. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
