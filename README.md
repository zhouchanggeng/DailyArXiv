| **[Infrared and Visible Image Fusion with Language-Driven Loss in CLIP Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16267v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) has attracted much attention owing to the highly-complementary properties of the two image modalities. Due to the lack of ground-truth fused images, the fusion output of current deep-learning based methods heavily depends on the loss functions defined mathematically. As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors representing the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques.

| **[See, Rank, and Filter: Important Word-Aware Clip Filtering via Scene Understanding for Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22906v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both MR and HD tasks.

| **[CLIP-like Model as a Foundational Density Ratio Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22881v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density ratio estimation is a core concept in statistical machine learning because it provides a unified mechanism for tasks such as importance weighting, divergence estimation, and likelihood-free inference, but its potential in vision and language models has not been fully explored. Modern vision-language encoders such as CLIP and SigLIP are trained with contrastive objectives that implicitly optimize log density ratios between joint and marginal image-text distributions, which implicitly learn similarity scores proportional to log density ratios. However, prior work has largely focused on their embedding utility, and the density-ratio structure induced by contrastive learning has not been systematically examined or exploited in multimodal applications. To address this gap, we reinterpret CLIP-style models as pretrained and general-purpose density ratio estimators and show that this perspective enables new algorithmic capabilities. We present a unified explanation of how contrastive objectives estimate density ratios and propose two practical applications: Importance Weight Learning and KL divergence estimation. Our Importance Weight Learning method requires only a single additional prompt and improves F1 scores by up to 7 points. We further show that CLIP-based density ratios support estimation of KL divergences that quantify how conditioning on an image or text alters the distribution of the other modality. Through qualitative examples and an N-gram analysis of captions, we find that these divergences capture semantic diversity and mode structure in multimodal data. Leveraging this property, we introduce a simple KL-guided data curation method that achieves performance competitive with LAION2B filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAHS-Attack: CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search Attack Method for Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21180v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Remeshing Method via Adaptive Multiple Original-Facet-Clipping and Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14306v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CVT (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation)-based remeshing optimizes mesh quality by leveraging the Voronoi-Delaunay framework to optimize vertex distribution and produce uniformly distributed vertices with regular triangles. Current CVT-based approaches can be classified into two categories: (1) exact methods (e.g., Geodesic CVT, Restricted Voronoi Diagrams) that ensure high quality but require significant computation; and (2) approximate methods that try to reduce computational complexity yet result in fair quality. To address this trade-off, we propose a CVT-based surface remeshing approach that achieves balanced optimization between quality and efficiency through multiple clipping times of 3D Centroidal Voronoi cells with curvature-adaptive original surface facets. The core idea of the method is that we adaptively adjust the number of clipping times according to local curvature, and use the angular relationship between the normal vectors of neighboring facets to represent the magnitude of local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00098v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains. Code of all experiments and benchmarks is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-pfl4asr.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Semantics Regulate: Rethinking Patch Shuffle and Internal Bias for Generated Image Detection with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19126v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of GANs and Diffusion Models poses new challenges for detecting AI-generated images. Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prototypical Contrastive Learning-based CLIP Fine-tuning for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17218v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to adapt large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, such as contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP), to enhance the performance of object reidentification (Re-ID) across various supervision settings. Although prompt learning has enabled a recent work named CLIP-ReID to achieve promising performance, the underlying mechanisms and the necessity of prompt learning remain unclear due to the absence of semantic labels in ReID tasks. In this work, we first analyze the role prompt learning in CLIP-ReID and identify its limitations. Based on our investigations, we propose a simple yet effective approach to adapt CLIP for supervised object Re-ID. Our approach directly fine-tunes the image encoder of CLIP using a prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) loss, eliminating the need for prompt learning. Experimental results on both person and vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to CLIP-ReID. Furthermore, we extend our PCL-based CLIP fine-tuning approach to unsupervised scenarios, where we achieve state-of-the art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHIPS: Efficient CLIP Adaptation via Curvature-aware Hybrid Influence-based Data Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18519v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting CLIP to vertical domains is typically approached by novel fine-tuning strategies or by continual pre-training (CPT) on large domain-specific datasets. Yet, data itself remains an underexplored factor in this process. We revisit this task from a data-centric perspective: Can effective data selection substitute for large-scale datasets in CPT? We introduce CHIPS (Curvature-aware Hybrid Influence in Projection Subspace), which assigns each image-text pair a utility score that integrates three complementary factors aligned with three goals: faithfulness via a curvature-aware, Newton-style alignment computed in CLIP's end-point subspace; scalability via an InfoNCE-aware curvature estimator with Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching; and retention via a selection-aware relevance weight combined with learnability to balance target adaptation against general-domain preservation. We justify this design theoretically by proving a lower-bound guarantee on the proxy's correlation with full-parameter alignment and by characterizing the bias-variance trade-offs introduced by curvature mixing and JL sketching. We evaluate CHIPS empirically across various settings: 1) CHIPS attains state-of-the-art performance among selection baselines on 17 medical benchmarks, matches full-dataset CPT with 30% of the data, and outperforms half-dataset CPT using only 10%; 2) on 31 general-domain benchmarks, CHIPS yields the smallest performance drop under 10-30% data-retention budgets. Code, data, and checkpoints will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under-review</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Weak-to-Strong Generalization for CLIP-based Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18396v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning large-scale commercial models with user intent is crucial to preventing harmful outputs. Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods.</p></details> | TMLR |
| **[Demystifying CLIP Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16671v6)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is an approach that has advanced research and applications in computer vision, fueling modern recognition systems and generative models. We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its data and not the model architecture or pre-training objective. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3% on ViT-B models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains 72.4%. Our observations hold across various model sizes, exemplified by ViT-H achieving 80.5%, without any bells-and-whistles. Curation code and training data distribution on metadata is made available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2103.00020 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[When Better Teachers Don't Make Better Students: Revisiting Knowledge Distillation for CLIP Models in VQA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17886v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success across multimodal tasks, yet their substantial computational demands hinder efficient deployment. Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATAC: Augmentation-Based Test-Time Adversarial Correction for CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17362v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its remarkable success in zero-shot image-text matching, CLIP remains highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations on images. As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.</p></details> | 16 pages |

We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |
| **[Generalized Gradient Norm Clipping & Non-Euclidean $(L_0,L_1)$-Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01913v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/ClippedScion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15633v1)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables models to learn new classes continually while preserving past knowledge. Recently, vision-language models like CLIP offer transferable features via multi-modal pre-training, making them well-suited for CIL. However, real-world visual and linguistic concepts are inherently hierarchical: a textual concept like "dog" subsumes fine-grained categories such as "Labrador" and "Golden Retriever," and each category entails its images. But existing CLIP-based CIL methods fail to explicitly capture this inherent hierarchy, leading to fine-grained class features drift during incremental updates and ultimately to catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose HASTEN (Hierarchical Semantic Tree Anchoring) that anchors hierarchical information into CIL to reduce catastrophic forgetting. First, we employ an external knowledge graph as supervision to embed visual and textual features in hyperbolic space, effectively preserving hierarchical structure as data evolves. Second, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting, we project gradients onto the null space of the shared hyperbolic mapper, preventing interference with prior tasks. These two steps work synergistically to enable the model to resist forgetting by maintaining hierarchical relationships. Extensive experiments show that HASTEN consistently outperforms existing methods while providing a unified structured representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting Gradient Normalization and Clipping for Nonconvex SGD under Heavy-Tailed Noise: Necessity, Sufficiency, and Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16561v4)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping has long been considered essential for ensuring the convergence of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) in the presence of heavy-tailed gradient noise. In this paper, we revisit this belief and explore whether gradient normalization can serve as an effective alternative or complement. We prove that, under individual smoothness assumptions, gradient normalization alone is sufficient to guarantee convergence of the nonconvex SGD. Moreover, when combined with clipping, it yields far better rates of convergence under more challenging noise distributions. We provide a unifying theory describing normalization-only, clipping-only, and combined approaches. Moving forward, we investigate existing variance-reduced algorithms, establishing that, in such a setting, normalization alone is sufficient for convergence. Finally, we present an accelerated variant that under second-order smoothness improves convergence. Our results provide theoretical insights and practical guidance for using normalization and clipping in nonconvex optimization with heavy-tailed noise.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intelligent Collaborative Optimization for Rubber Tyre Film Production Based on Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12060v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of smart manufacturing is addressing the limitations of traditional centralized scheduling and inflexible production line configurations in the rubber tyre industry, especially in terms of coping with dynamic production demands. Contemporary tyre manufacturing systems form complex networks of tightly coupled subsystems pronounced nonlinear interactions and emergent dynamics. This complexity renders the effective coordination of multiple subsystems, posing an essential yet formidable task. For high-dimensional, multi-objective optimization problems in this domain, we introduce a deep reinforcement learning algorithm: Multi-path Differentiated Clipping Proximal Policy Optimization (MPD-PPO). This algorithm employs a multi-branch policy architecture with differentiated gradient clipping constraints to ensure stable and efficient high-dimensional policy updates. Validated through experiments on width and thickness control in rubber tyre film production, MPD-PPO demonstrates substantial improvements in both tuning accuracy and operational efficiency. The framework successfully tackles key challenges, including high dimensionality, multi-objective trade-offs, and dynamic adaptation, thus delivering enhanced performance and production stability for real-time industrial deployment in tyre manufacturing.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[FarSLIP: Discovering Effective CLIP Adaptation for Fine-Grained Remote Sensing Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14901v1)** | 2025-11-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As CLIP's global alignment limits its ability to capture fine-grained details, recent efforts have focused on enhancing its region-text alignment. However, current remote sensing (RS)-specific CLIP variants still inherit this limited spatial awareness. We identify two key limitations behind this: (1) current RS image-text datasets generate global captions from object-level labels, leaving the original object-level supervision underutilized; (2) despite the success of region-text alignment methods in general domain, their direct application to RS data often leads to performance degradation. To address these, we construct the first multi-granularity RS image-text dataset, MGRS-200k, featuring rich object-level textual supervision for RS region-category alignment. We further investigate existing fine-grained CLIP tuning strategies and find that current explicit region-text alignment methods, whether in a direct or indirect way, underperform due to severe degradation of CLIP's semantic coherence. Building on these, we propose FarSLIP, a Fine-grained Aligned RS Language-Image Pretraining framework. Rather than the commonly used patch-to-CLS self-distillation, FarSLIP employs patch-to-patch distillation to align local and global visual cues, which improves feature discriminability while preserving semantic coherence. Additionally, to effectively utilize region-text supervision, it employs simple CLS token-based region-category alignment rather than explicit patch-level alignment, further enhancing spatial awareness. FarSLIP features improved fine-grained vision-language alignment in RS domain and sets a new state of the art not only on RS open-vocabulary semantic segmentation, but also on image-level tasks such as zero-shot classification and image-text retrieval. Our dataset, code, and models are available at https://github.com/NJU-LHRS/FarSLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear and Latent-Linear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168v6)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) verifiable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of prediction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a seemingly-naive procedure can simultaneously offer all three desiderata. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc procedure in which we surgically manipulate the spectrum of the linear system after it was learned using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectral clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after any eigenvalues whose magnitude exceeds one have been clipped to one (without altering the eigenvectors). We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn nonlinear dynamical systems that can generate stable predictions of nonlinear phenomena, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate predictive dynamics that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our code and datasets can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</p></details> |  |
| **[Backdooring CLIP through Concept Confusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09095v2)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to deep learning models by allowing adversaries to implant hidden behaviors that remain dormant on clean inputs but are maliciously triggered at inference. Existing backdoor attack methods typically rely on explicit triggers such as image patches or pixel perturbations, which makes them easier to detect and limits their applicability in complex settings. To address this limitation, we take a different perspective by analyzing backdoor attacks through the lens of concept-level reasoning, drawing on insights from interpretable AI. We show that traditional attacks can be viewed as implicitly manipulating the concepts activated within a model's latent space. This motivates a natural question: can backdoors be built by directly manipulating concepts? To answer this, we propose the Concept Confusion Attack (CCA), a novel framework that designates human-understandable concepts as internal triggers, eliminating the need for explicit input modifications. By relabeling images that strongly exhibit a chosen concept and fine-tuning on this mixed dataset, CCA teaches the model to associate the concept itself with the attacker's target label. Consequently, the presence of the concept alone is sufficient to activate the backdoor, making the attack stealthier and more resistant to existing defenses. Using CLIP as a case study, we show that CCA achieves high attack success rates while preserving clean-task accuracy and evading state-of-the-art defenses.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGS-Net: Distillation-Guided Gradient Surgery for CLIP Fine-Tuning in AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13108v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models has led to the widespread proliferation of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy violations, and trust erosion in digital media. Although large-scale multimodal models like CLIP offer strong transferable representations for detecting synthetic content, fine-tuning them often induces catastrophic forgetting, which degrades pre-trained priors and limits cross-domain generalization. To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression. Extensive experiments on 50 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average margin of 6.6, achieving superior detection performance and generalization across diverse generation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept Regions Matter: Benchmarking CLIP with a New Cluster-Importance Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12978v1)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition yet remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, particularly background over-reliance. We introduce Cluster-based Concept Importance (CCI), a novel interpretability method that uses CLIP's own patch embeddings to group spatial patches into semantically coherent clusters, mask them, and evaluate relative changes in model predictions. CCI sets a new state of the art on faithfulness benchmarks, surpassing prior methods by large margins; for example, it yields more than a twofold improvement on the deletion-AUC metric for MS COCO retrieval. We further propose that CCI, when combined with GroundedSAM, automatically categorizes predictions as foreground- or background-driven, providing a crucial diagnostic ability. Existing benchmarks such as CounterAnimals, however, rely solely on accuracy and implicitly attribute all performance degradation to background correlations. Our analysis shows this assumption to be incomplete, since many errors arise from viewpoint variation, scale shifts, and fine-grained object confusions. To disentangle these effects, we introduce COVAR, a benchmark that systematically varies object foregrounds and backgrounds. Leveraging CCI with COVAR, we present a comprehensive evaluation of eighteen CLIP variants, offering methodological advances and empirical evidence that chart a path toward more robust VLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages, 21 figures |

Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 258% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |

Building on interpretability studies, we conduct an exhaustive analysis and find that certain heads, distributed across layers, are detrimental to the resulting representations. To mitigate their impact, we propose a simple yet effective Attention Ablation Technique (AAT) that suppresses selected heads by directly manipulating their attention weights. By incorporating two complementary strategies tailored to different application scenarios, AAT enables the systematic identification and ablation of harmful heads with minimal overhead. Experiments show that AAT consistently improves downstream performance across diverse domains, boosting recall by up to 11.1% on cross-modal retrieval benchmarks. These results highlight that AAT can effectively refine large-scale VLMs with virtually no extra inference cost, while yielding semantically meaningful patterns that align with existing interpretability findings.</p></details> | 18 pages, 8 figures |

While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.</p></details> |  |

We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Vision-language models such as CLIP offer strong transferable representations via multi-modal supervision, making them promising for CIL. However, applying CLIP to CIL poses two major challenges: (1) adapting to downstream tasks often requires additional learnable modules, increasing model complexity and susceptibility to forgetting; and (2) while multi-modal representations offer complementary strengths, existing methods have yet to fully realize their potential in effectively integrating visual and textual modalities. To address these issues, we propose BOFA (Bridge-layer Orthogonal Fusion for Adaptation), a novel framework for CIL. BOFA confines all model adaptation exclusively to CLIP's existing cross-modal bridge-layer, thereby adding no extra parameters or inference cost. To prevent forgetting within this layer, it leverages Orthogonal Low-Rank Fusion, a mechanism that constrains parameter updates to a low-rank ``safe subspace" mathematically constructed to be orthogonal to past task features. This ensures stable knowledge accumulation without data replay. Furthermore, BOFA employs a cross-modal hybrid prototype that synergizes stable textual prototypes with visual counterparts derived from our stably adapted bridge-layer, enhancing classification performance. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks show that BOFA achieves superior accuracy and efficiency compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While it performs strongly on zero-shot and few-shot tasks, its robustness to linguistic variation, particularly paraphrasing, remains underexplored. Paraphrase robustness is essential for reliable deployment, especially in socially sensitive contexts where inconsistent representations can amplify demographic biases. In this paper, we introduce the Paraphrase Ranking Stability Metric (PRSM), a novel measure for quantifying CLIP's sensitivity to paraphrased queries. Using the Social Counterfactuals dataset, a benchmark designed to reveal social and demographic biases, we empirically assess CLIP's stability under paraphrastic variation, examine the interaction between paraphrase robustness and gender, and discuss implications for fairness and equitable deployment of multimodal systems. Our analysis reveals that robustness varies across paraphrasing strategies, with subtle yet consistent differences observed between male- and female-associated queries.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, accpeted as short paper at MMM 2026</p></details> |

Recent thinking models generate explicit reasoning traces for interpretability; however, their reasoning often appears convincing while being logically inconsistent or weakly grounded in visual evidence. We identify and formalize these issues through two diagnostic metrics: Think Answer Consistency (TAC), which measures the alignment between reasoning and answers, and Video Attention Score (VAS), which captures the extent to which reasoning depends on visual versus textual cues. Analysis across 11 video reasoning benchmarks shows that current models rely heavily on linguistic priors rather than visual content. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that enhances both temporal precision and reasoning consistency. Our approach combines timestamp aware supervised fine tuning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) guided by a novel Temporal Alignment Reward (TAR). This dual step post training stage encourages temporally aligned and causally coherent video reasoning. The resulting model, Video R2, achieves consistently higher TAC, VAS, and accuracy across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating that improvements in temporal alignment and reasoning coherence lead to more accurate and trustworthy video understanding. Our code, dataset, and model will be open sourced.</p></details> | <details><summary>Video...</summary><p>Video-R2 Technical Report</p></details> |

This passive paradigm creates a semantic bottleneck: models cannot rewatch, refocus, or verify evidence, leading to shallow visual reasoning on tasks requiring fine grained spatio temporal understanding. In this work, we introduce Interactive Video Reasoning, a new paradigm that transforms video into an active cognitive workspace, enabling models to "think with videos". Our model, Video CoM, reasons through a Chain of Manipulations (CoM), performing iterative visual actions to gather and refine evidence. To support this behavior, we construct Video CoM Instruct, an 18K instruction tuning dataset curated for multi step manipulation reasoning. Beyond supervised learning, we further optimize the manipulation policy via reinforcement learning with reasoning aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike prior work that relies solely on sparse answer rewards, our method introduces step level reasoning rewards, guiding the model toward grounded and consistent reasoning. Video CoM achieves strong results across nine video reasoning benchmarks, improving average performance by 3.6 percent over recent state of the art models, while training on only 25K SFT and 3K GRPO video samples, significantly fewer than comparable large scale models. Ablation studies demonstrate that reasoning aware rewards improve both accuracy and interpretability. Code: https://github.com/mbzuai-oryx/Video-CoM</p></details> | Technical Report |

However, it relies on ensembles of frontier LLMs to achieve new bounds and is a pure inference system that models cannot internalize the evolving strategies. We introduce ThetaEvolve, an open-source framework that simplifies and extends AlphaEvolve to efficiently scale both in-context learning and Reinforcement Learning (RL) at test time, allowing models to continually learn from their experiences in improving open optimization problems. ThetaEvolve features a single LLM, a large program database for enhanced exploration, batch sampling for higher throughput, lazy penalties to discourage stagnant outputs, and optional reward shaping for stable training signals, etc. ThetaEvolve is the first evolving framework that enable a small open-source model, like DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B, to achieve new best-known bounds on open problems (circle packing and first auto-correlation inequality) mentioned in AlphaEvolve. Besides, across two models and four open tasks, we find that ThetaEvolve with RL at test-time consistently outperforms inference-only baselines, and the model indeed learns evolving capabilities, as the RL-trained checkpoints demonstrate faster progress and better final performance on both trained target task and other unseen tasks. We release our code publicly: https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, link: https://github.com/ypwang61/ThetaEvolve</p></details> |

However, datasets containing suboptimal and fragmented trajectories present challenges for reward propagation, resulting in inaccurate value estimation and degraded policy performance. While trajectory stitching via generative models offers a promising solution, existing augmentation methods frequently produce trajectories that are either confined to the support of the behavior policy or violate the underlying dynamics, thereby limiting their effectiveness for policy improvement. We propose ASTRO, a data augmentation framework that generates distributionally novel and dynamics-consistent trajectories for offline RL. ASTRO first learns a temporal-distance representation to identify distinct and reachable stitch targets. We then employ a dynamics-guided stitch planner that adaptively generates connecting action sequences via Rollout Deviation Feedback, defined as the gap between target state sequence and the actual arrived state sequence by executing predicted actions, to improve trajectory stitching's feasibility and reachability. This approach facilitates effective augmentation through stitching and ultimately enhances policy learning. ASTRO outperforms prior offline RL augmentation methods across various algorithms, achieving notable performance gain on the challenging OGBench suite and demonstrating consistent improvements on standard offline RL benchmarks such as D4RL.</p></details> |  |

Unlike conventional supervised fine-tuning, SuperIntelliAgent learns autonomously without annotation: the learner generates candidate outputs, the verifier evaluates them through step-by-step reasoning, and their interaction produces chosen/rejected pairs for Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This converts each input into a pseudo-training signal for continual improvement. The framework integrates dual-scale memory: short-term in-context memory that preserves reasoning traces across refinement cycles, and long-term memory that consolidates acquired knowledge through lightweight on-the-fly fine-tuning. A replay buffer retains samples that show verifiable progress and replays them as auxiliary supervision, reinforcing recent learning while forming adaptive curricula. SuperIntelliAgent is infrastructure-agnostic and can be plugged into existing agentic frameworks while turning ordinary inference loops into a lifelong optimization process. We posit that pairing a trainable learner with a reasoning-capable verifier forms a minimal reliable unit of growing intelligence, as paired feedback and partial-history replay yield richer learning curricula and stronger preference alignment. With a small number of automatically generated DPO pairs, the learner improves across all benchmarks, indicating that this mechanism provides a promising direction for continual intelligence accumulation and real-world deployment.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Asymmetric REINFORCE for off-Policy Reinforcement Learning: Balancing positive and negative rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20520v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly used to align large language models (LLMs). Off-policy methods offer greater implementation simplicity and data efficiency than on-policy techniques, but often result in suboptimal performance. In this work, we study the intermediate range of algorithms between off-policy RL and supervised fine-tuning by analyzing a simple off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, where the advantage is defined as $A=r-V$, with $r$ a reward and $V$ some tunable baseline. Intuitively, lowering $V$ emphasizes high-reward samples, while raising it penalizes low-reward ones more heavily. We first provide a theoretical analysis of this off-policy REINFORCE algorithm, showing that when the baseline $V$ lower-bounds the expected reward, the algorithm enjoys a policy improvement guarantee. Our analysis reveals that while on-policy updates can safely leverage both positive and negative signals, off-policy updates benefit from focusing more on positive rewards than on negative ones. We validate our findings experimentally in a controlled stochastic bandit setting and through fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[From CAD to POMDP: Probabilistic Planning for Robotic Disassembly of End-of-Life Products](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23407v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To support the circular economy, robotic systems must not only assemble new products but also disassemble end-of-life (EOL) ones for reuse, recycling, or safe disposal. Existing approaches to disassembly sequence planning often assume deterministic and fully observable product models, yet real EOL products frequently deviate from their initial designs due to wear, corrosion, or undocumented repairs. We argue that disassembly should therefore be formulated as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which naturally captures uncertainty about the product's internal state. We present a mathematical formulation of disassembly as a POMDP, in which hidden variables represent uncertain structural or physical properties. Building on this formulation, we propose a task and motion planning framework that automatically derives specific POMDP models from CAD data, robot capabilities, and inspection results. To obtain tractable policies, we approximate this formulation with a reinforcement-learning approach that operates on stochastic action outcomes informed by inspection priors, while a Bayesian filter continuously maintains beliefs over latent EOL conditions during execution. Using three products on two robotic systems, we demonstrate that this probabilistic planning framework outperforms deterministic baselines in terms of average disassembly time and variance, generalizes across different robot setups, and successfully adapts to deviations from the CAD model, such as missing or stuck parts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ambiguity Awareness Optimization: Towards Semantic Disambiguation for Direct Preference Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23391v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a widely used reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) method across various domains. Recent research has increasingly focused on the role of token importance in improving DPO effectiveness. It is observed that identical or semantically similar content (defined as ambiguous content) frequently appears within the preference pairs. We hypothesize that the presence of ambiguous content during DPO training may introduce ambiguity, thereby limiting further improvements in alignment. Through mathematical analysis and proof-of-concept experiments, we reveal that ambiguous content may potentially introduce ambiguities, thereby degrading performance. To address this issue, we introduce Ambiguity Awareness Optimization (AAO), a simple yet effective approach that automatically re-weights ambiguous content to reduce ambiguities by calculating semantic similarity from preference pairs. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AAO consistently and significantly surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in performance, without markedly increasing response length, across multiple model scales and widely adopted benchmark datasets, including AlpacaEval 2, MT-Bench, and Arena-Hard. Specifically, AAO outperforms DPO by up to 8.9 points on AlpacaEval 2 and achieves an improvement of by up to 15.0 points on Arena-Hard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 main</p></details> |
| **[Toward Honest Language Models for Deductive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09222v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deductive reasoning is the process of deriving conclusions strictly from the given premises, without relying on external knowledge. We define honesty in this setting as a model's ability to respond only when the conclusion is logically entailed by the premises, and to abstain otherwise. However, current language models often fail to reason honestly, producing unwarranted answers when the input is insufficient. To study this challenge, we formulate honest deductive reasoning as multi-step tasks where models must either derive the correct conclusion or abstain. We curate two datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that prompting and existing training methods, including GRPO with or without supervised fine-tuning initialization, struggle on these tasks. In particular, GRPO optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. To address this, we propose ACNCHOR, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling honest deductive reasoning in language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emergent Coordination and Phase Structure in Independent Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23315v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A clearer understanding of when coordination emerges, fluctuates, or collapses in decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly sought in order to characterize the dynamics of multi-agent learning systems. We revisit fully independent Q-learning (IQL) as a minimal decentralized testbed and run large-scale experiments across environment size L and agent density rho. We construct a phase map using two axes - the cooperative success rate (CSR) and a stability index derived from TD-error variance - revealing three distinct regimes: a coordinated and stable phase, a fragile transition region, and a jammed or disordered phase. A sharp double Instability Ridge separates these regimes and corresponds to persistent kernel drift, the time-varying shift of each agent's effective transition kernel induced by others' policy updates. Synchronization analysis further shows that temporal alignment is required for sustained cooperation, and that competition between drift and synchronization generates the fragile regime. Removing agent identifiers eliminates drift entirely and collapses the three-phase structure, demonstrating that small inter-agent asymmetries are a necessary driver of drift. Overall, the results show that decentralized MARL exhibits a coherent phase structure governed by the interaction between scale, density, and kernel drift, suggesting that emergent coordination behaves as a distribution-interaction-driven phase phenomenon.</p></details> | 22 pages, 19 figures |
| **[OBLR-PO: A Theoretical Framework for Stable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23310v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training methods for large language models have advanced rapidly, yet their design has largely been guided by heuristics rather than systematic theoretical principles. This gap limits our understanding of the properties of the gradient estimators and the associated optimization algorithms, thereby constraining opportunities to improve training stability and overall performance. In this work, we provide a unified theoretical framework that characterizes the statistical properties of commonly used policy-gradient estimators under mild assumptions. Our analysis establishes unbiasedness, derives exact variance expressions, and yields an optimization-loss upper bound that enables principled reasoning about learning dynamics. Building on these results, we prove convergence guarantees and derive an adaptive learning-rate schedule governed by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of gradients. We further show that the variance-optimal baseline is a gradient-weighted estimator, offering a new principle for variance reduction and naturally enhancing stability beyond existing methods. These insights motivate Optimal Baseline and Learning-Rate Policy Optimization (OBLR-PO), an algorithm that jointly adapts learning rates and baselines in a theoretically grounded manner. Experiments on Qwen3-4B-Base and Qwen3-8B-Base demonstrate consistent gains over existing policy optimization methods, validating that our theoretical contributions translate into practical improvements in large-scale post-training.</p></details> | 19 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Adapting Like Humans: A Metacognitive Agent with Test-time Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23262v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong perceptual reasoning abilities, yet they often struggle to adapt efficiently when encountering novel tasks at test time. In contrast, humans leverage the metacognitive model with memory, enabling continuous strategy refinement through metacognitive control when faced with new challenges. To bridge this gap, we propose metacognitive test-time reasoning (MCTR), a framework that equips models with the ability to learn, adapt, and improve during test time through metacognitive self-updating. Inspired by the dual structure of human metacognition, MCTR comprises meta-level and object-level VLM reasoning modules, each equipped with dedicated memory systems for hierarchical adaptive reasoning. Specifically, MCTR consists of (1) a meta-reasoning module which incrementally builds a structured memory by discovering and storing task-relevant rules, environmental patterns, and action-outcome relationships from test-time observations as natural language descriptions; and (2) an action-reasoning module that determines optimal actions through context-aware perception and strategic reasoning by dynamically retrieving and integrating knowledge from memory. The action-reasoning module continuously updates its policy through proposed metacognitive test-time reinforcement learning, adapting as knowledge memory evolves. We evaluate MCTR on 45 Atari games (33 seen, 12 unseen). MCTR demonstrates robust test-time adaptation, achieving 9/12 top-1 results on unseen games compared with baselines. Analyses through ablations, learning dynamics, and case studies reveal the complementary contributions of both components and show meta-reasoning evolving toward human-like adaptation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault-Tolerant MARL for CAVs under Observation Perturbations for Highway On-Ramp Merging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23193v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) holds significant promise for enabling cooperative driving among Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs). However, its practical application is hindered by a critical limitation, i.e., insufficient fault tolerance against observational faults. Such faults, which appear as perturbations in the vehicles' perceived data, can substantially compromise the performance of MARL-based driving systems. Addressing this problem presents two primary challenges. One is to generate adversarial perturbations that effectively stress the policy during training, and the other is to equip vehicles with the capability to mitigate the impact of corrupted observations. To overcome the challenges, we propose a fault-tolerant MARL method for cooperative on-ramp vehicles incorporating two key agents. First, an adversarial fault injection agent is co-trained to generate perturbations that actively challenge and harden the vehicle policies. Second, we design a novel fault-tolerant vehicle agent equipped with a self-diagnosis capability, which leverages the inherent spatio-temporal correlations in vehicle state sequences to detect faults and reconstruct credible observations, thereby shielding the policy from misleading inputs. Experiments in a simulated highway merging scenario demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline MARL approaches, achieving near-fault-free levels of safety and efficiency under various observation fault patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Obstruction reasoning for robotic grasping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23186v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Successful robotic grasping in cluttered environments not only requires a model to visually ground a target object but also to reason about obstructions that must be cleared beforehand. While current vision-language embodied reasoning models show emergent spatial understanding, they remain limited in terms of obstruction reasoning and accessibility planning. To bridge this gap, we present UNOGrasp, a learning-based vision-language model capable of performing visually-grounded obstruction reasoning to infer the sequence of actions needed to unobstruct the path and grasp the target object. We devise a novel multi-step reasoning process based on obstruction paths originated by the target object. We anchor each reasoning step with obstruction-aware visual cues to incentivize reasoning capability. UNOGrasp combines supervised and reinforcement finetuning through verifiable reasoning rewards. Moreover, we construct UNOBench, a large-scale dataset for both training and benchmarking, based on MetaGraspNetV2, with over 100k obstruction paths annotated by humans with obstruction ratios, contact points, and natural-language instructions. Extensive experiments and real-robot evaluations show that UNOGrasp significantly improves obstruction reasoning and grasp success across both synthetic and real-world environments, outperforming generalist and proprietary alternatives.

| **[Learning Rules from Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13599v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can flexibly generalize knowledge across domains by leveraging structured relational representations. While prior research has shown how such representations support analogical reasoning, less is known about how they are recruited to guide adaptive behavior. We address this gap by introducing the Relational Regression Tree Learner (RRTL), a model that incrementally builds policies over structured relational inputs by selecting task-relevant relations during the learning process. RRTL is grounded in the framework of relational reinforcement learning but diverges from traditional approaches by focusing on ground (i.e., non-variabilized) rules that refer to specific object configurations. Across three Atari games of increasing relational complexity (Breakout, Pong, Demon Attack), the model learns to act effectively by identifying a small set of relevant relations from a broad pool of candidate relations. A comparative version of the model, which partitions the state space using relative magnitude values (e.g., "more", "same", "less"), showed more robust learning than a version using logical (binary) splits. These results provide a proof of principle that reinforcement signals can guide the selection of structured representations, offering a computational framework for understanding how relational knowledge is learned and deployed in adaptive behavior.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VTG models assume that a relevant segment always exists, causing them to always predict a target segment even when the query is irrelevant to the video. While recent approaches attempt to handle irrelevant queries, they can only reject those that are entirely unrelated to the video and still fail to handle hard-irrelevant queries that are semantically similar but not actually relevant. To address this, we propose Refusal-Aware Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RA-RFT) to effectively refuse hard-irrelevant queries in VTG. Our method is based on the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and integrates four reward objectives-format, refuse-IoU, explain, and query correction-to improve both relevance discrimination and fine-grained semantic reasoning. In addition, to effectively support RA-RFT, we construct a Hard-Irrelevant VTG (HI-VTG) dataset, which includes hard-irrelevant queries and their refusal answers. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across various relevance-aware VTG scenarios, including hard-irrelevant VTG, simply-shuffled RA-VTG, and human-annotated RA-VTG settings. We also show that the proposed method is scalable by applying it to various LVLM-based VTG models. Our code is available at https://github.com/JINSUBY/RA-RFT.</p></details> | 19 pages |

This research highlights the role of P2P trading in efficient energy distribution and its synergy with advanced optimization techniques. While traditional rule-based methods perform well under stable conditions, they struggle in dynamic environments. To address this, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Deep Q-Networks (DQN), is combined with community/distributed P2P trading mechanisms. By incorporating auction-based market clearing, a price advisor agent, and load and battery management, the approach achieves significant improvements. Results show that, compared to baseline models, DQN reduces electricity costs by 14.2% in Ireland and 5.16% in Finland, while increasing electricity revenue by 7.24% and 12.73%, respectively. PPO achieves the lowest peak hour demand, reducing it by 55.5% in Ireland, while DQN reduces peak hour demand by 50.0% in Ireland and 27.02% in Finland. These improvements are attributed to both MARL algorithms and P2P energy trading, which together results in electricity cost and peak hour demand reduction, and increase electricity selling revenue. This study highlights the complementary strengths of DQN, PPO, and P2P trading in achieving efficient, adaptable, and sustainable energy management in rural communities.</p></details> | <details><summary>51 pa...</summary><p>51 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables, Preprint of the article published in Applied Energy: Shah, M.I.A., Victorio, M.E.C., Duffy, M., Barrett, E. and Mason, K.

| **[Evolutionary Discovery of Heuristic Policies for Traffic Signal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23122v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic Signal Control (TSC) involves a challenging trade-off: classic heuristics are efficient but oversimplified, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves high performance yet suffers from poor generalization and opaque policies. Online Large Language Models (LLMs) provide general reasoning but incur high latency and lack environment-specific optimization. To address these issues, we propose Temporal Policy Evolution for Traffic (\textbf{\method{}}), which uses LLMs as an evolution engine to derive specialized heuristic policies. The framework introduces two key modules: (1) Structured State Abstraction (SSA), converting high-dimensional traffic data into temporal-logical facts for reasoning; and (2) Credit Assignment Feedback (CAF), tracing flawed micro-decisions to poor macro-outcomes for targeted critique. Operating entirely at the prompt level without training, \method{} yields lightweight, robust policies optimized for specific traffic environments, outperforming both heuristics and online LLM actors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Responsible Development of Generative AI for Education: An Evaluation-Driven Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12687v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major challenge facing the world is the provision of equitable and universal access to quality education. Recent advances in generative AI (gen AI) have created excitement about the potential of new technologies to offer a personal tutor for every learner and a teaching assistant for every teacher. The full extent of this dream, however, has not yet materialised. We argue that this is primarily due to the difficulties with verbalising pedagogical intuitions into gen AI prompts and the lack of good evaluation practices, reinforced by the challenges in defining excellent pedagogy. Here we present our work collaborating with learners and educators to translate high level principles from learning science into a pragmatic set of seven diverse educational benchmarks, spanning quantitative, qualitative, automatic and human evaluations; and to develop a new set of fine-tuning datasets to improve the pedagogical capabilities of Gemini, introducing LearnLM-Tutor. Our evaluations show that LearnLM-Tutor is consistently preferred over a prompt tuned Gemini by educators and learners on a number of pedagogical dimensions. We hope that this work can serve as a first step towards developing a comprehensive educational evaluation framework, and that this can enable rapid progress within the AI and EdTech communities towards maximising the positive impact of gen AI in education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning for Drone Route Optimization in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01886v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rapid post-disaster road damage assessment is critical for effective emergency response, yet traditional optimization methods suffer from excessive computational time and require domain knowledge for algorithm design, making them unsuitable for time-sensitive disaster scenarios. This study proposes an attention-based encoder-decoder model (AEDM) for rapid drone routing decision in post-disaster road damage assessment. The method employs deep reinforcement learning to determine high-quality drone assessment routes without requiring algorithmic design knowledge. A network transformation method is developed to convert link-based routing problems into equivalent node-based formulations, while a synthetic road network generation technique addresses the scarcity of large-scale training datasets. The model is trained using policy optimization with multiple optima (POMO) with multi-task learning capabilities to handle diverse parameter combinations. Experimental results demonstrate two key strengths of AEDM: it outperforms commercial solvers by 20--71\% and traditional heuristics by 23--35\% in solution quality, while achieving rapid inference (1--2 seconds) versus 100--2,000 seconds for traditional methods. The model exhibits strong generalization across varying problem scales, drone numbers, and time constraints, consistently outperforming baseline methods on unseen parameter distributions and real-world road networks. The proposed method effectively balances computational efficiency with solution quality, making it particularly suitable for time-critical disaster response applications where rapid decision-making is essential for saving lives. The source code for AEDM is publicly available at https://github.com/PJ-HTU/AEDM-for-Post-disaster-road-assessment.</p></details> | 28 pages, 15 figures |
| **[McSc: Motion-Corrective Preference Alignment for Video Generation with Self-Critic Hierarchical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22974v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video (T2V) generation has achieved remarkable progress in producing high-quality videos aligned with textual prompts. However, aligning synthesized videos with nuanced human preference remains challenging due to the subjective and multifaceted nature of human judgment. Existing video preference alignment methods rely on costly human annotations or utilize proxy metrics to predict preference, which lacks the understanding of human preference logic. Moreover, they usually directly align T2V models with the overall preference distribution, ignoring potential conflict dimensions like motion dynamics and visual quality, which may bias models towards low-motion content. To address these issues, we present Motion-corrective alignment with Self-critic hierarchical Reasoning (McSc), a three-stage reinforcement learning framework for robust preference modeling and alignment. Firstly, Self-critic Dimensional Reasoning (ScDR) trains a generative reward model (RM) to decompose preferences into per-dimension assessments, using self-critic reasoning chains for reliable learning. Secondly, to achieve holistic video comparison, we introduce Hierarchical Comparative Reasoning (HCR) for structural multi-dimensional reasoning with hierarchical reward supervision. Finally, using RM-preferred videos, we propose Motion-corrective Direct Preference Optimization (McDPO) to optimize T2V models, while dynamically re-weighting alignment objective to mitigate bias towards low-motion content. Experiments show that McSc achieves superior performance in human preference alignment and generates videos with high-motion dynamic.</p></details> |  |

While recent advances have improved low-level humanoid locomotion and robot manipulation, language-conditioned whole-body control remains a significant challenge. Existing methods are often limited to simple instructions and sacrifice either motion diversity or physical plausibility. To address this, we introduce Humanoid-LLA, a Large Language Action Model that maps expressive language commands to physically executable whole-body actions for humanoid robots. Our approach integrates three core components: a unified motion vocabulary that aligns human and humanoid motion primitives into a shared discrete space; a vocabulary-directed controller distilled from a privileged policy to ensure physical feasibility; and a physics-informed fine-tuning stage using reinforcement learning with dynamics-aware rewards to enhance robustness and stability. Extensive evaluations in simulation and on a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid show that Humanoid-LLA delivers strong language generalization while maintaining high physical fidelity, outperforming existing language-conditioned controllers in motion naturalness, stability, and execution success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://humanoidlla.github.io/</p></details> |

However, these methods deteriorate in open-ended domains like medical consultation, where feedback is inherently ambiguous, highly context-dependent, and cannot be reduced to a reliable scalar signal. In such settings, RL must either rely on supervision-intensive reward models that often fail to generalize, or it falls into pathological behaviors such as reward hacking - an especially troubling risk for high-stakes medical dialogue. To address these limitations, we introduce ORBIT, an open-ended rubric-based incremental training framework for high-stakes medical dialogue. ORBIT integrates synthetic dialogue generation with dynamically constructed rubrics that serve as adaptive guides for incremental RL. Instead of relying on external medical knowledge bases or handcrafted rule sets, ORBIT uses rubric-driven feedback to steer the learning process. Its judge component can be instantiated with general-purpose instruction-following LLMs, removing the need for any task-specific fine-tuning. Applied to the Qwen3-4B-Instruct model, ORBIT raises the HealthBench-Hard score from 7.0 to 27.5 using only 2k training samples, achieving SOTA performance for models at this scale. With larger rubric datasets, ORBIT-trained models further compete with the strongest open-source baselines on HealthBench-Hard. Our analysis shows that rubric-guided RL consistently improves consultation quality across diverse medical scenarios. We also apply such rubric generation and training pipeline to InfoBench, where ORBIT enhances instruction-following performance, highlighting the generality of rubric-based feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language-conditioned world model improves policy generalization by reading environmental descriptions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22904v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To interact effectively with humans in the real world, it is important for agents to understand language that describes the dynamics of the environment--that is, how the environment behaves--rather than just task instructions specifying "what to do". Understanding this dynamics-descriptive language is important for human-agent interaction and agent behavior. Recent work address this problem using a model-based approach: language is incorporated into a world model, which is then used to learn a behavior policy. However, these existing methods either do not demonstrate policy generalization to unseen games or rely on limiting assumptions. For instance, assuming that the latency induced by inference-time planning is tolerable for the target task or expert demonstrations are available. Expanding on this line of research, we focus on improving policy generalization from a language-conditioned world model while dropping these assumptions. We propose a model-based reinforcement learning approach, where a language-conditioned world model is trained through interaction with the environment, and a policy is learned from this model--without planning or expert demonstrations. Our method proposes Language-aware Encoder for Dreamer World Model (LED-WM) built on top of DreamerV3. LED-WM features an observation encoder that uses an attention mechanism to explicitly ground language descriptions to entities in the observation. We show that policies trained with LED-WM generalize more effectively to unseen games described by novel dynamics and language compared to other baselines in several settings in two environments: MESSENGER and MESSENGER-WM.To highlight how the policy can leverage the trained world model before real-world deployment, we demonstrate the policy can be improved through fine-tuning on synthetic test trajectories generated by the world model.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeuRI...</summary><p>NeuRIPS 2025.

The primary challenge in PRVR arises from the semantic asymmetry between textual and visual modalities, as videos often contain substantial content irrelevant to the query. Existing methods coarsely align paired videos and text queries to construct the semantic space, neglecting the critical cross-modal dual nature inherent in this task: inter-sample correlation and intra-sample redundancy. To this end, we propose a novel PRVR framework to systematically exploit these two characteristics. Our framework consists of three core modules. First, the Inter Correlation Enhancement (ICE) module captures inter-sample correlation by identifying semantically similar yet unpaired text queries and video moments, combining them to form pseudo-positive pairs for more robust semantic space construction. Second, the Intra Redundancy Mining (IRM) module mitigates intra-sample redundancy by mining redundant moment features and distinguishing them from query-relevant moments, encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Finally, to reinforce these modules, we introduce the Temporal Coherence Prediction (TCP) module, enhancing discrimination of fine-grained moment-level semantics by training the model to predict the original temporal order of randomly shuffled video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method, achieving state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |

In this context, optogenetics enables modulation of gene expression using light as an external input, allowing fine-tuning of protein levels to unlock dynamic metabolic control and regulation of cell growth. Optogenetic systems can be actuated by light intensity. However, relying solely on intensity-driven control (i.e., signal amplitude) may fail to properly tune optogenetic bioprocesses when the dose-response relationship (i.e., light intensity versus gene-expression strength) is steep. In these cases, tunability is effectively constrained to either fully active or fully repressed gene expression, with little intermediate regulation. Pulse-width modulation, a concept widely used in electronics, can alleviate this issue by alternating between fully ON and OFF light intensity within forcing periods, thereby smoothing the average response and enhancing process controllability. Naturally, optimizing pulse-width-modulated optogenetics entails a switching-time optimal control problem with a binary input over many forcing periods. While this can be formulated as a mixed-integer program on a refined time grid, the number of decision variables can grow rapidly with increasing time-grid resolution and number of forcing periods, compromising tractability. Here, we propose an alternative solution based on reinforcement learning. We parametrize control actions via the duty cycle, a continuous variable that encodes the ON-to-OFF switching time within each forcing period, thereby respecting the intrinsic binary nature of the light intensity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted conference paper</p></details> |
| **[ORION: Teaching Language Models to Reason Efficiently in the Language of Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22891v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve strong performance in mathematics, code generation, and task planning, but their reliance on long chains of verbose "thinking" tokens leads to high latency, redundancy, and incoherent reasoning paths. Inspired by the Language of Thought Hypothesis, which posits that human reasoning operates over a symbolic, compositional mental language called Mentalese, we introduce a framework that trains models to reason in a similarly compact style. Mentalese encodes abstract reasoning as ultra-compressed, structured tokens, enabling models to solve complex problems with far fewer steps. To improve both efficiency and accuracy, we propose SHORTER LENGTH PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION (SLPO), a reinforcement learning method that rewards concise solutions that stay correct, while still allowing longer reasoning when needed. Applied to Mentalese-aligned models, SLPO yields significantly higher compression rates by enabling concise reasoning that preserves the benefits of detailed thinking without the computational overhead. Across benchmarks including AIME 2024 and 2025, MinervaMath, OlympiadBench, Math500, and AMC, our ORION models produce reasoning traces with 4-16x fewer tokens, achieve up to 5x lower inference latency, and reduce training costs by 7-9x relative to the DeepSeek R1 Distilled model, while maintaining 90-98% of its accuracy. ORION also surpasses Claude and ChatGPT-4o by up to 5% in accuracy while maintaining 2x compression. These results show that Mentalese-style compressed reasoning offers a step toward human-like cognitive efficiency, enabling real-time, cost-effective reasoning without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, when faced with complex problems, most users are often unable to provide accurate and effective prompts to interact with LLMs, thus limiting the performance of LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose Prompt-R1, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that uses a small-scale LLM to collaborate with large-scale LLMs, replacing user interaction to solve problems better. This collaboration is cast as a multi-turn prompt interaction, where the small-scale LLM thinks and generates prompts, and the large-scale LLM performs complex reasoning. A dual-constrained reward is designed to optimize for correctness, generation quality, and reasoning accuracy. Prompt-R1 provides a plug-and-play framework that supports both inference and training with various large-scale LLMs. Experiments on multiple public datasets show that Prompt-R1 significantly outperforms baseline models across tasks.

We introduce MARVO, a physics-aware, learning-integrated odometry framework that fuses underwater image formation modeling, differentiable matching, and reinforcement-learning optimization. At the front-end, we extend transformer-based feature matcher with a Physics Aware Radiance Adapter that compensates for color channel attenuation and contrast loss, yielding geometrically consistent feature correspondences under turbidity. These semi dense matches are combined with inertial and pressure measurements inside a factor-graph backend, where we formulate a keyframe-based visual-inertial-barometric estimator using GTSAM library. Each keyframe introduces (i) Pre-integrated IMU motion factors, (ii) MARVO-derived visual pose factors, and (iii) barometric depth priors, giving a full-state MAP estimate in real time. Lastly, we introduce a Reinforcement-Learningbased Pose-Graph Optimizer that refines global trajectories beyond local minima of classical least-squares solvers by learning optimal retraction actions on SE(2).</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, Submitted to CVPR2026</p></details> |

CzechLynx contains 39,760 camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 319 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. In addition to the real camera trap data, we provide a large complementary set of photorealistic synthetic images and a Unity-based generation pipeline with diffusion-based text-to-texture modeling, capable of producing arbitrarily large amounts of synthetic data spanning diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To enable systematic testing across realistic ecological scenarios, we define three complementary evaluation protocols: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set, covering cross-regional and long-term monitoring settings. With the provided resources, CzechLynx offers a unique, flexible benchmark for robust evaluation of computer vision and machine learning models across realistic ecological scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

We introduce Adaptive and Dynamic Neuro-Fuzzy Clustering, a novel streaming-capable framework that combines Convolutional Neural Network-based feature extraction with an online fuzzy clustering engine. ADNF initializes soft partitions via Fuzzy C-Means, then continuously updates micro-cluster centers, densities, and fuzziness parameters using a Fuzzy Temporal Index (FTI) that measures entropy evolution. A topology refinement stage performs density-weighted merging and entropy-guided splitting to guard against over- and under-segmentation. On the C-NMC leukemia microscopy dataset, our tool achieves a silhouette score of 0.51, demonstrating superior cohesion and separation over static baselines. The method's adaptive uncertainty modeling and label-free operation hold immediate potential for integration within the INFANT pediatric oncology network, enabling scalable, up-to-date support for personalized leukemia management.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |

Accurate aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation is essential for assessing carbon storage and wildfire fuel loads, yet traditional methods rely on labor-intensive field measurements or remote sensing approaches with significant limitations in dense vegetation. In this work, we propose a novel learning-based method for estimating AGB from a single ground-based RGB image. We frame this as a dense prediction task, introducing AGB density maps, where each pixel represents tree biomass normalized by the plot area and each tree's image area. We leverage the recently introduced synthetic 3D SPREAD dataset, which provides realistic forest scenes with per-image tree attributes (height, trunk and canopy diameter) and instance segmentation masks. Using these assets, we compute AGB via allometric equations and train a model to predict AGB density maps, integrating them to recover the AGB estimate for the captured scene. Our approach achieves a median AGB estimation error of 1.22 kg/m^2 on held-out SPREAD data and 1.94 kg/m^2 on a real-image dataset. To our knowledge, this is the first method to estimate aboveground biomass directly from a single RGB image, opening up the possibility for a scalable, interpretable, and cost-effective solution for forest monitoring, while also enabling broader participation through citizen science initiatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at STAG 2025</p></details> |

However, it remains challenging due to the subtle texture differences and similar spatial structures among geospatial objects, which cause semantic ambiguity and misclassification. Additional complexities arise from irregular object shapes, blurred boundaries, and overlapping spatial distributions of objects, resulting in diverse and intricate edge morphologies. To address these issues, we propose TEFormer, a texture-aware and edge-guided Transformer. Our model features a texture-aware module (TaM) in the encoder to capture fine-grained texture distinctions between visually similar categories, thereby enhancing semantic discrimination. The decoder incorporates an edge-guided tri-branch decoder (Eg3Head) to preserve local edges and details while maintaining multiscale context-awareness. Finally, an edge-guided feature fusion module (EgFFM) effectively integrates contextual, detail, and edge information to achieve refined semantic segmentation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that TEFormer yields mIoU scores of 88.57% on Potsdam and 81.46% on Vaihingen, exceeding the next best methods by 0.73% and 0.22%. On the LoveDA dataset, it secures the second position with an overall mIoU of 53.55%, trailing the optimal performance by a narrow margin of 0.19%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE GRSL</p></details> |

As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.6 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.</p></details> |  |

However, many existing denoisers depend on large annotated datasets or supervised learning, which restricts their usability in clinical environments with heterogeneous modalities and limited ground-truth data. To address this limitation, we introduce DNA-Prior, a universal unsupervised denoising framework that reconstructs clean images directly from corrupted observations through a mathematically principled hybrid prior. DNA-Prior integrates (i) an implicit architectural prior, enforced through a deep network parameterisation, with (ii) an explicit spectral-spatial prior composed of a frequency-domain fidelity term and a spatial regularisation functional. This dual-domain formulation yields a well-structured optimisation problem that jointly preserves global frequency characteristics and local anatomical structure, without requiring any external training data or modality-specific tuning. Experiments across multiple modalities show that DNA achieves consistent noise suppression and structural preservation under diverse noise conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Rendering for Multimodal Autonomous Driving: Merging Neural and Physics-Based Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09464v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural reconstruction models for autonomous driving simulation have made significant strides in recent years, with dynamic models becoming increasingly prevalent. However, these models are typically limited to handling in-domain objects closely following their original trajectories. We introduce a hybrid approach that combines the strengths of neural reconstruction with physics-based rendering. This method enables the virtual placement of traditional mesh-based dynamic agents at arbitrary locations, adjustments to environmental conditions, and rendering from novel camera viewpoints. Our approach significantly enhances novel view synthesis quality -- especially for road surfaces and lane markings -- while maintaining interactive frame rates through our novel training method, NeRF2GS. This technique leverages the superior generalization capabilities of NeRF-based methods and the real-time rendering speed of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). We achieve this by training a customized NeRF model on the original images with depth regularization derived from a noisy LiDAR point cloud, then using it as a teacher model for 3DGS training. This process ensures accurate depth, surface normals, and camera appearance modeling as supervision. With our block-based training parallelization, the method can handle large-scale reconstructions (greater than or equal to 100,000 square meters) and predict segmentation masks, surface normals, and depth maps. During simulation, it supports a rasterization-based rendering backend with depth-based composition and multiple camera models for real-time camera simulation, as well as a ray-traced backend for precise LiDAR simulation.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods suffer from limited anatomical fidelity, restricted axial length, and substantial computational cost, placing them beyond reach for regions with limited resources and infrastructure. We introduce TRACE, a framework that generates 3D medical images with spatiotemporal alignment using a 2D multimodal-conditioned diffusion approach. TRACE models sequential 2D slices as video frame pairs, combining segmentation priors and radiology reports for anatomical alignment, incorporating optical flow to sustain temporal coherence. During inference, an overlapping-frame strategy links frame pairs into a flexible length sequence, reconstructed into a spatiotemporally and anatomically aligned 3D volume. Experimental results demonstrate that TRACE effectively balances computational efficiency with preserving anatomical fidelity and spatiotemporal consistency.

| **[Convolutional Feature Noise Reduction for 2D Cardiac MR Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22983v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noise reduction constitutes a crucial operation within Digital Signal Processing. Regrettably, it frequently remains neglected when dealing with the processing of convolutional features in segmentation networks. This oversight could trigger the butterfly effect, impairing the subsequent outcomes within the entire feature system. To complete this void, we consider convolutional features following Gaussian distributions as feature signal matrices and then present a simple and effective feature filter in this study. The proposed filter is fundamentally a low-amplitude pass filter primarily aimed at minimizing noise in feature signal inputs and is named Convolutional Feature Filter (CFF). We conducted experiments on two established 2D segmentation networks and two public cardiac MR image datasets to validate the effectiveness of the CFF, and the experimental findings demonstrated a decrease in noise within the feature signal matrices. To enable a numerical observation and analysis of this reduction, we developed a binarization equation to calculate the information entropy of feature signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taming the Light: Illumination-Invariant Semantic 3DGS-SLAM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22968v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme exposure degrades both the 3D map reconstruction and semantic segmentation accuracy, which is particularly detrimental to tightly-coupled systems. To achieve illumination invariance, we propose a novel semantic SLAM framework with two designs. First, the Intrinsic Appearance Normalization (IAN) module proactively disentangles the scene's intrinsic properties, such as albedo, from transient lighting. By learning a standardized, illumination-invariant appearance model, it assigns a stable and consistent color representation to each Gaussian primitive. Second, the Dynamic Radiance Balancing Loss (DRB-Loss) reactively handles frames with extreme exposure. It activates only when an image's exposure is poor, operating directly on the radiance field to guide targeted optimization. This prevents error accumulation from extreme lighting without compromising performance under normal conditions. The synergy between IAN's proactive invariance and DRB-Loss's reactive correction endows our system with unprecedented robustness. Evaluations on public datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in camera tracking, map quality, and semantic and geometric accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[RobotSeg: A Model and Dataset for Segmenting Robots in Image and Video](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22950v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate robot segmentation is a fundamental capability for robotic perception. It enables precise visual servoing for VLA systems, scalable robot-centric data augmentation, accurate real-to-sim transfer, and reliable safety monitoring in dynamic human-robot environments. Despite the strong capabilities of modern segmentation models, surprisingly it remains challenging to segment robots. This is due to robot embodiment diversity, appearance ambiguity, structural complexity, and rapid shape changes. Embracing these challenges, we introduce RobotSeg, a foundation model for robot segmentation in image and video. RobotSeg is built upon the versatile SAM 2 foundation model but addresses its three limitations for robot segmentation, namely the lack of adaptation to articulated robots, reliance on manual prompts, and the need for per-frame training mask annotations, by introducing a structure-enhanced memory associator, a robot prompt generator, and a label-efficient training strategy. These innovations collectively enable a structure-aware, automatic, and label-efficient solution. We further construct the video robot segmentation (VRS) dataset comprising over 2.8k videos (138k frames) with diverse robot embodiments and environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RobotSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance on both images and videos, establishing a strong foundation for future advances in robot perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/showlab/RobotSeg</p></details> |

Leveraging Noise for Domain Generalized Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22948v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain generalization in semantic segmentation faces challenges from domain shifts, particularly under adverse conditions. While diffusion-based data generation methods show promise, they introduce inherent misalignment between generated images and semantic masks. This paper presents FLEX-Seg (FLexible Edge eXploitation for Segmentation), a framework that transforms this limitation into an opportunity for robust learning. FLEX-Seg comprises three key components: (1) Granular Adaptive Prototypes that captures boundary characteristics across multiple scales, (2) Uncertainty Boundary Emphasis that dynamically adjusts learning emphasis based on prediction entropy, and (3) Hardness-Aware Sampling that progressively focuses on challenging examples. By leveraging inherent misalignment rather than enforcing strict alignment, FLEX-Seg learns robust representations while capturing rich stylistic variations. Experiments across five real-world datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over state-of-the-art methods, achieving 2.44% and 2.63% mIoU gains on ACDC and Dark Zurich. Our findings validate that adaptive strategies for handling imperfect synthetic data lead to superior domain generalization.

This research aimed to benchmark and advance semi-supervised learning (SSL) as a solution for this data scarcity problem. We organized the 2nd Semi-supervised Teeth Segmentation (STS 2024) Challenge at MICCAI 2024. We provided a large-scale dataset comprising over 90,000 2D images and 3D axial slices, which includes 2,380 OPG images and 330 CBCT scans, all featuring detailed instance-level FDI annotations on part of the data. The challenge attracted 114 (OPG) and 106 (CBCT) registered teams. To ensure algorithmic excellence and full transparency, we rigorously evaluated the valid, open-source submissions from the top 10 (OPG) and top 5 (CBCT) teams, respectively. All successful submissions were deep learning-based SSL methods. The winning semi-supervised models demonstrated impressive performance gains over a fully-supervised nnU-Net baseline trained only on the labeled data. For the 2D OPG track, the top method improved the Instance Affinity (IA) score by over 44 percentage points. For the 3D CBCT track, the winning approach boosted the Instance Dice score by 61 percentage points. This challenge confirms the substantial benefit of SSL for complex, instance-level medical image segmentation tasks where labeled data is scarce. The most effective approaches consistently leveraged hybrid semi-supervised frameworks that combined knowledge from foundational models like SAM with multi-stage, coarse-to-fine refinement pipelines. Both the challenge dataset and the participants' submitted code have been made publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/ricoleehduu/STS-Challenge-2024), ensuring transparency and reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[MammoRGB: Dual-View Mammogram Synthesis Using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22759v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: This study aims to develop and evaluate a three channel denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for synthesizing single breast dual view mammograms and to assess the impact of channel representations on image fidelity and cross view consistency. Materials and Methods: A pretrained three channel DDPM, sourced from Hugging Face, was fine tuned on a private dataset of 11020 screening mammograms to generate paired craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views. Three third channel encodings of the CC and MLO views were evaluated: sum, absolute difference, and zero channel. Each model produced 500 synthetic image pairs. Quantitative assessment involved breast mask segmentation using Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), with distributional comparisons against 2500 real pairs using Earth Movers Distance (EMD) and Kolmogorov Smirnov (KS) tests. Qualitative evaluation included a visual Turing test by a non expert radiologist to assess cross view consistency and artifacts. Results: Synthetic mammograms showed IoU and DSC distributions comparable to real images, with EMD and KS values (0.020 and 0.077 respectively). Models using sum or absolute difference encodings outperformed others in IoU and DSC (p < 0.001), though distributions remained broadly similar. Generated CC and MLO views maintained cross view consistency, with 6 to 8 percent of synthetic images exhibiting artifacts consistent with those in the training data. Conclusion: Three channel DDPMs can generate realistic and anatomically consistent dual view mammograms with promising applications in dataset augmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HarmoCLIP: Harmonizing Global and Regional Representations in Contrastive Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22594v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has demonstrated remarkable generalization ability and strong performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks. However, due to the lack of region-level supervision, CLIP exhibits limited fine-grained semantic understanding. Although several methods attempt to mitigate this issue, they unintentionally disrupt the global alignment, resulting in a persistent trade-off where improving local perception simultaneously degrades global coherence. In this paper, we propose HarmoCLIP, a novel framework designed to harmonize global and region representations within CLIP. We first identify that the absence of direct alignment between local textual and visual semantics is the fundamental cause of the trade-off. To address this, HarmoCLIP introduces an explicit fine-grained semantic supervision term that directly aligns textual segments with their corresponding visual regions, effectively bridging the image region space and the textual space. To further strengthen the representation capability at the local level, our method introduces a novel Region-Language Alignment supervision strategy that promotes fine-grained semantic learning without compromising global semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HarmoCLIP achieves state-of-the-art (improvement up to 69.78%) performance on the global task of retrieval and yields a substantial 3.2% improvement in Top-1 accuracy on the region task of bounding-box classification, consistently outperforming prior approaches while providing a balanced, efficient, and plug-and-play solution to the global-local trade-off in CLIP.

This requires careful planning, often via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based anatomical 3D models. However, creating these models is often time-consuming and user dependent. We organized the Surgical Planning in Pediatric Neuroblastoma (SPPIN) challenge, to stimulate developments on this topic, and set a benchmark for fully automatic segmentation of neuroblastoma on multi-model MRI. The challenge started with a training phase, where teams received 78 sets of MRI scans from 34 patients, consisting of both diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans. The final test phase, consisting of 18 MRI sets from 9 patients, determined the ranking of the teams. Ranking was based on the Dice similarity coefficient (Dice score), the 95th percentile of the Hausdorff distance (HD95) and the volumetric similarity (VS). The SPPIN challenge was hosted at MICCAI 2023. The final leaderboard consisted of 9 teams. The highest-ranking team achieved a median Dice score 0.82, a median HD95 of 7.69 mm and a VS of 0.91, utilizing a large, pretrained network called STU-Net. A significant difference for the segmentation results between diagnostic and post-chemotherapy MRI scans was observed (Dice = 0.89 vs Dice = 0.59, P = 0.01) for the highest-ranking team. SPPIN is the first medical segmentation challenge in extracranial pediatric oncology. The highest-ranking team used a large pre-trained network, suggesting that pretraining can be of use in small, heterogenous datasets. Although the results of the highest-ranking team were high for most patients, segmentation especially in small, pre-treated tumors were insufficient. Therefore, more reliable segmentation methods are needed to create clinically applicable models to aid surgical planning in pediatric neuroblastoma.</p></details> | 23 pages, 6 figures |

To bridge this gap, we propose UMind-VL, a unified foundation model designed to synergize pixel-level structural understanding with complex clinical reasoning. We first introduce UMind-DS, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 1.2 million ultrasound image-text pairs across 16 anatomical regions, enriching standard data with pixel-level annotations and clinician-validated rationales. Architecturally, UMind-VL incorporates a lightweight Dynamic Convolutional Mask Decoder that generates masks via dynamic kernels conditioned on LLM outputs. This design, combined with task-specific tokens, unifies segmentation, detection, geometric measurement, and diagnosis tasks within a single framework. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that UMind-VL significantly outperforms existing generalist multimodal models and achieves performance on par with, or superior to, state-of-the-art specialist models across segmentation, detection, keypoint localization, and diagnostic reasoning benchmarks, while maintaining strong generalization ability. We demonstrate the capability of UMind-VL in Figure 1.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a new approach to tampering detection using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Instead of training SAM to identify tampered areas, we propose a novel strategy. The entire image is transformed into a blank canvas from the perspective of neural models. Any modifications to this blank canvas would be noticeable to the models. To achieve this idea, we introduce adversarial perturbations to prevent SAM from ``seeing anything'', allowing it to identify forged regions when the image is tampered with. Due to SAM's powerful perceiving capabilities, naive adversarial attacks cannot completely tame SAM. To thoroughly deceive SAM and make it blind to the image, we introduce a frequency-aware optimization strategy, which further enhances the capability of tamper localization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Therefore, manual curation is still widely used for either preparing high-quality training data or fixing errors before analysis. We present VessQC, an open-source tool for uncertainty-guided curation of large 3D microscopy segmentations. By integrating uncertainty maps, VessQC directs user attention to regions most likely containing biologically meaningful errors. In a preliminary user study uncertainty-guided correction significantly improved error detection recall from 67% to 94.0% (p=0.007) without a significant increase in total curation time. VessQC thus enables efficient, human-in-the-loop refinement of volumetric segmentations and bridges a key gap in real-world applications between uncertainty estimation and practical human-computer interaction.

The proposed approach provides direct information about what the potential use of objects is, as well as guidance on where and how a manipulator should engage, whereas conventional methods treat affordance detection as a semantic segmentation task, focusing solely on answering the what question. To address this gap, we propose a Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) by introducing 3D keypoint quadruplet that harnesses the synergistic potential of RGB and Depth image to provide information on execution position, direction, and extent. Benchmark testing demonstrates that FAKP-Net outperforms existing models by significant margins in affordance segmentation task and keypoint detection task. Real-world experiments also showcase the reliability of our method in accomplishing manipulation tasks with previously unseen objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IROS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Controllable 3D Object Generation with Single Image Prompt](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22194v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the impressive generative capabilities of diffusion models have been demonstrated, producing images with remarkable fidelity. Particularly, existing methods for the 3D object generation tasks, which is one of the fastest-growing segments in computer vision, pre-dominantly use text-to-image diffusion models with textual inversion which train a pseudo text prompt to describe the given image. In practice, various text-to-image generative models employ textual inversion to learn concepts or styles of target object in the pseudo text prompt embedding space, thereby generating sophisticated outputs. However, textual inversion requires additional training time and lacks control ability. To tackle this issues, we propose two innovative methods: (1) using an off-the-shelf image adapter that generates 3D objects without textual inversion, offering enhanced control over conditions such as depth, pose, and text. (2) a depth conditioned warmup strategy to enhance 3D consistency. In experimental results, ours show qualitatively and quantitatively comparable performance and improved 3D consistency to the existing text-inversion-based alternatives. Furthermore, we conduct a user study to assess (i) how well results match the input image and (ii) whether 3D consistency is maintained. User study results show that our model outperforms the alternatives, validating the effectiveness of our approaches.

However, the quadratic growth in computational demands as the number of tokens increases limits its practical efficiency. Although recent methods have combined the strengths of convolutions and self-attention to achieve better trade-offs, the expensive pairwise token affinity and complex matrix operations inherent in self-attention remain a bottleneck. To address this challenge, we propose S2AFormer, an efficient Vision Transformer architecture featuring novel Strip Self-Attention (SSA). We design simple yet effective Hybrid Perception Blocks (HPBs) to effectively integrate the local perception capabilities of CNNs with the global context modeling of Transformer's attention mechanisms. A key innovation of SSA lies in its reduction of the spatial dimensions of $K$ and $V$, while compressing the channel dimensions of $Q$ and $K$. This design significantly reduces computational overhead while preserving accuracy, striking an optimal balance between efficiency and effectiveness. We evaluate the robustness and efficiency of S2AFormer through extensive experiments on multiple vision benchmarks, including ImageNet-1k for image classification, ADE20k for semantic segmentation, and COCO for object detection and instance segmentation. Results demonstrate that S2AFormer achieves significant accuracy gains with superior efficiency in both GPU and non-GPU environments, making it a strong candidate for efficient vision Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE-TIP, 14 pages, 8 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Active Negative Loss: A Robust Framework for Learning with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02373v3)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep supervised learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks, yet it remains susceptible to overfitting when confronted with noisy labels. To address this issue, noise-robust loss functions offer an effective solution for enhancing learning in the presence of label noise. In this work, we systematically investigate the limitation of the recently proposed Active Passive Loss (APL), which employs Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as its passive loss function. Despite the robustness brought by MAE, one of its key drawbacks is that it pays equal attention to clean and noisy samples; this feature slows down convergence and potentially makes training difficult, particularly in large-scale datasets. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel loss function class, termed Normalized Negative Loss Functions (NNLFs), which serve as passive loss functions within the APL framework. NNLFs effectively address the limitations of MAE by concentrating more on memorized clean samples. By replacing MAE in APL with our proposed NNLFs, we enhance APL and present a new framework called Active Negative Loss (ANL). Moreover, in non-symmetric noise scenarios, we propose an entropy-based regularization technique to mitigate the vulnerability to the label imbalance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the new loss functions adopted by our ANL framework can achieve better or comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods across various label noise types and in image segmentation tasks.

While truncated diffusion probabilistic models (TDPMs) hold strong potential with a paradigm optimization, existing TDPMs suffer from entangled accuracy and diversity of predictions with insufficient fidelity and plausibility. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose Ambiguity-aware Truncated Flow Matching (ATFM), which introduces a novel inference paradigm and dedicated model components. Firstly, we propose Data-Hierarchical Inference, a redefinition of AMIS-specific inference paradigm, which enhances accuracy and diversity at data-distribution and data-sample level, respectively, for an effective disentanglement. Secondly, Gaussian Truncation Representation (GTR) is introduced to enhance both fidelity of predictions and reliability of truncation distribution, by explicitly modeling it as a Gaussian distribution at $T_{\text{trunc}}$ instead of using sampling-based approximations. Thirdly, Segmentation Flow Matching (SFM) is proposed to enhance the plausibility of diverse predictions by extending semantic-aware flow transformation in Flow Matching (FM). Comprehensive evaluations on LIDC and ISIC3 datasets demonstrate that ATFM outperforms SOTA methods and simultaneously achieves a more efficient inference. ATFM improves GED and HM-IoU by up to $12\%$ and $7.3\%$ compared to advanced methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures, extended version of AAAI-26 paper</p></details> |
| **[ROVER: Recursive Reasoning Over Videos with Vision-Language Models for Embodied Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01943v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have exhibited impressive capabilities across diverse image understanding tasks, but still struggle in settings that require reasoning over extended sequences of camera frames from a video. This limits their utility in embodied settings, which require reasoning over long frame sequences from a continuous stream of visual input at each moment of a task attempt. To address this limitation, we propose ROVER (Reasoning Over VidEo Recursively), a framework that enables the model to recursively decompose long-horizon video trajectories into segments corresponding to shorter subtasks within the trajectory. In doing so, ROVER facilitates more focused and accurate reasoning over temporally localized frame sequences without losing global context. We evaluate ROVER, implemented using an in-context learning approach, on diverse OpenX Embodiment videos and on a new dataset derived from RoboCasa that consists of 543 videos showing both expert and perturbed non-expert trajectories across 27 robotic manipulation tasks. ROVER outperforms strong baselines across three video reasoning tasks: task progress estimation, frame-level natural language reasoning, and video question answering. We observe that, by reducing the number of frames the model reasons over at each timestep, ROVER mitigates hallucinations, especially during unexpected or non-optimal moments of a trajectory. In addition, by enabling the implementation of a subtask-specific sliding context window, ROVER's time complexity scales linearly with video length, an asymptotic improvement over baselines.

Robotic systems have emerged as transformative solutions to mitigate these inherent limitations. A pivotal moment has arrived, where a confluence of pressing clinical needs and breakthroughs in AI creates an opportunity for a paradigm shift toward Embodied Intelligence (EI), enabling robots to navigate complex vascular networks and adapt to dynamic physiological conditions. Data-driven approaches, leveraging advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and machine learning, drive this evolution by enabling real-time vessel segmentation, device tracking, and anatomical landmark detection. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning further enhance navigation strategies and replicate expert techniques. This review systematically analyzes the integration of EI into endovascular robotics, identifying profound systemic challenges such as the heterogeneity in validation standards and the gap between human mimicry and machine-native capabilities. Based on this analysis, a conceptual roadmap is proposed that reframes the ultimate objective away from systems that supplant clinical decision-making. This vision of augmented intelligence, where the clinician's role evolves into that of a high-level supervisor, provides a principled foundation for the future of the field.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

In this work, we focus on object grounding, i.e., localizing an object of interest in a visual scene (e.g., an image) based on verbal human instructions. Despite recent progress, a dominant research trend relies on using text as an intermediate representation. These approaches typically transcribe speech to text, extract relevant object keywords, and perform grounding using models pretrained on large text-vision datasets. However, we question both the efficiency and robustness of such transcription-based pipelines. Specifically, we ask: Can we achieve direct audio-visual alignment without relying on text? To explore this possibility, we simplify the task by focusing on grounding from single-word spoken instructions. We introduce a new audio-based grounding dataset that covers a wide variety of objects and diverse human accents. We then adapt and benchmark several models from the closely audio-visual field. Our results demonstrate that direct grounding from audio is not only feasible but, in some cases, even outperforms transcription-based methods, especially in terms of robustness to linguistic variability. Our findings encourage a renewed interest in direct audio grounding and pave the way for more robust and efficient multimodal understanding systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[PPBoost: Progressive Prompt Boosting for Text-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21984v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-prompted foundation models for medical image segmentation offer an intuitive way to delineate anatomical structures from natural language queries, but their predictions often lack spatial precision and degrade under domain shift. In contrast, visual-prompted models achieve strong segmentation performance across diverse modalities by leveraging spatial cues of precise bounding-box (bbox) prompts to guide the segmentation of target lesions. However, it is costly and challenging to obtain the precise visual prompts in clinical practice. We propose PPBoost (Progressive Prompt-Boosting), a framework that bridges these limitations by transforming weak text-derived signals into strong, spatially grounded visual prompts, operating under a strict zero-shot regime with no image- or pixel-level segmentation labels. PPBoost first uses a vision-language model to produce initial pseudo-bboxes conditioned on the textual object descriptions and applies an uncertainty-aware criterion to filter unreliable predictions. The retained image-bboxes pairs are then leveraged to train a pseudo-labeled detector, producing the high-quality bboxes for the query images. During inference, PPBoost further refines the generated bboxes by appropriately expanding them to tightly cover the target anatomical structures. The enhanced spatially-grounding bbox prompts guide existing segmentation models to generate final dense masks, effectively amplifying weak text cues into strong spatial guidance. Across three datasets spanning diverse modalities and anatomies, PPBoost consistently improves Dice and Normalized Surface Distance over text- and visual-prompted baselines and, notably, surpasses few-shot segmentation models without using labeled data. PPBoost can generalize to multiple typical visual segmentation model backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing SAM 2 and SAM 3 for Zero-Shot Segmentation of 3D Medical Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21926v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for promptable segmentation, including SAM, SAM 2, and the recently released SAM 3, have renewed interest in zero-shot segmentation of medical imaging. Although these models perform strongly on natural images, their behavior on medical data remains insufficiently characterized. While SAM 2 is widely used for annotation in 3D medical workflows, SAM 3 introduces a new perception backbone, detector-tracker pipeline, and concept-level prompting that may alter its behavior under spatial prompts. We present the first controlled comparison of SAM 2 and SAM 3 for zero-shot segmentation of 3D medical volumes and videos under purely visual prompting, with concept mechanisms disabled. We assess whether SAM 3 can serve as an out-of-the-box replacement for SAM 2 without customization. We benchmark both models on 16 public datasets (CT, MRI, 3D and cine ultrasound, endoscopy) covering 54 anatomical structures, pathologies, and surgical instruments. Prompts are restricted to the first frame and use four modes: single-click, multi-click, bounding box, and dense mask. This design standardizes preprocessing, prompt placement, propagation rules, and metric computation to disentangle prompt interpretation from propagation. Prompt-frame analysis shows that SAM 3 provides substantially stronger initialization than SAM 2 for click prompting across most structures. In full-volume analysis, SAM 3 retains this advantage for complex, vascular, and soft-tissue anatomies, emerging as the more versatile general-purpose segmenter. While SAM 2 remains competitive for compact, rigid organs under strong spatial guidance, it frequently fails on challenging targets where SAM 3 succeeds. Overall, our results suggest that SAM 3 is the superior default choice for most medical segmentation tasks, particularly those involving sparse user interaction or complex anatomical topology.</p></details> |  |

However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, the inherent hallucination and reliability issues of AI continue to raise persistent concerns. Consequently, application users and regulators increasingly ask critical questions such as: Does the application incorporate AI capabilities? and What specific types of AI functionalities are embedded? Preliminary efforts have been made to identify AI capabilities in mobile software; however, existing approaches mainly rely on manual inspection and rule-based heuristics. These methods are not only costly and time-consuming but also struggle to adapt advanced AI techniques. To address the limitations of existing methods, we propose LLMAID (Large Language Model for AI Discovery). LLMAID includes four main tasks: (1) candidate extraction, (2) knowledge base interaction, (3) AI capability analysis and detection, and (4) AI service summarization. We apply LLMAID to a dataset of 4,201 Android applications and demonstrate that it identifies 242% more real-world AI apps than state-of-the-art rule-based approaches. Our experiments show that LLM4AID achieves high precision and recall, both exceeding 90%, in detecting AI-related components. Additionally, a user study indicates that developers find the AI service summaries generated by LLMAID to be more informative and preferable to the original app descriptions. Finally, we leverage LLMAID to perform an empirical analysis of AI capabilities across Android apps. The results reveal a strong concentration of AI functionality in computer vision (54.80%), with object detection emerging as the most common task (25.19%).</p></details> |  |

Early Risk Detection (ERD) on the Web has become a key task in the scientific community for identifying early signs of mental health behaviors based on social media activity. This work presents our participation in the MentalRiskES 2025 challenge, specifically in Task 1, aimed at classifying users at high or low risk of developing a gambling-related disorder. We proposed three methods based on a CPI+DMC approach, addressing predictive effectiveness and decision-making speed as independent objectives. The components were implemented using the SS3, BERT with extended vocabulary, and SBERT models, followed by decision policies based on historical user analysis. Although it was a challenging corpus, two of our proposals achieved the top two positions in the official results, performing notably in decision metrics. Further analysis revealed some difficulty in distinguishing between users at high and low risk, reinforcing the need to explore strategies to improve data interpretation and quality, and to promote more transparent and reliable ERD systems for mental disorders.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Ib...</summary><p>In Iberian Language Evaluation Forum (IberLEF 2025), Zaragoza, Spain</p></details> |
| **[Toward Automatic Safe Driving Instruction: A Large-Scale Vision Language Model Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23311v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale Vision Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit advanced capabilities in tasks that require visual information, including object detection. These capabilities have promising applications in various industrial domains, such as autonomous driving. For example, LVLMs can generate safety-oriented descriptions of videos captured by road-facing cameras. However, ensuring comprehensive safety requires monitoring driver-facing views as well to detect risky events, such as the use of mobiles while driving. Thus, the ability to process synchronized inputs is necessary from both driver-facing and road-facing cameras. In this study, we develop models and investigate the capabilities of LVLMs by constructing a dataset and evaluating their performance on this dataset. Our experimental results demonstrate that while pre-trained LVLMs have limited effectiveness, fine-tuned LVLMs can generate accurate and safety-aware driving instructions. Nonetheless, several challenges remain, particularly in detecting subtle or complex events in the video. Our findings and error analysis provide valuable insights that can contribute to the improvement of LVLM-based systems in this domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MMLoSo 2025</p></details> |
| **[Synthetic Industrial Object Detection: GenAI vs. Feature-Based Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23241v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reducing the burden of data generation and annotation remains a major challenge for the cost-effective deployment of machine learning in industrial and robotics settings. While synthetic rendering is a promising solution, bridging the sim-to-real gap often requires expert intervention. In this work, we benchmark a range of domain randomization (DR) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques, including feature-based methods, generative AI (GenAI), and classical rendering approaches, for creating contextualized synthetic data without manual annotation. Our evaluation focuses on the effectiveness and efficiency of low-level and high-level feature alignment, as well as a controlled diffusion-based DA method guided by prompts generated from real-world contexts. We validate our methods on two datasets: a proprietary industrial dataset (automotive and logistics) and a public robotics dataset. Results show that if render-based data with enough variability is available as seed, simpler feature-based methods, such as brightness-based and perceptual hashing filtering, outperform more complex GenAI-based approaches in both accuracy and resource efficiency. Perceptual hashing consistently achieves the highest performance, with mAP50 scores of 98% and 67% on the industrial and robotics datasets, respectively. Additionally, GenAI methods present significant time overhead for data generation at no apparent improvement of sim-to-real mAP values compared to simpler methods. Our findings offer actionable insights for efficiently bridging the sim-to-real gap, enabling high real-world performance from models trained exclusively on synthetic data.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of robust visual inspection systems and their extensive data requirements hinder widespread adoption in semi-controlled industrial settings. In this context, we propose a pose-agnostic, zero-shot quality inspection framework that compares real scenes against real-time Digital Twins (DT) in the RGB-D space. Our approach enables efficient real-time DT rendering by semantically describing industrial scenes through object detection and pose estimation of known Computer-Aided Design models. We benchmark tools for real-time, multimodal RGB-D DT creation while tracking consumption of computational resources. Additionally, we provide an extensible and hierarchical annotation strategy for multi-criteria defect detection, unifying pose labelling with logical and structural defect annotations. Based on an automotive use case featuring the quality inspection of an axial flux motor, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Our results demonstrate detection performace, achieving intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of up to 63.3% compared to ground-truth masks, even if using simple distance measurements under semi-controlled industrial conditions. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on generalizable, low-data defect detection methods in dynamic manufacturing settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegDINO3D: 3D Instance Segmentation Empowered by Both Image-Level and Object-Level 2D Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16098v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.6 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implementation of a Skin Lesion Detection System for Managing Children with Atopic Dermatitis Based on Ensemble Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23082v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The amendments made to the Data 3 Act and impact of COVID-19 have fostered the growth of digital healthcare market and promoted the use of medical data in artificial intelligence in South Korea. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is diagnosed via subjective evaluations without using objective diagnostic methods, thereby increasing the risk of misdiagnosis. It is also similar to psoriasis in appearance, further complicating its accurate diagnosis. Existing studies on skin diseases have used high-quality dermoscopic image datasets, but such high-quality images cannot be obtained in actual clinical settings. Moreover, existing systems must ensure accuracy and fast response times. To this end, an ensemble learning-based skin lesion detection system (ENSEL) was proposed herein. ENSEL enhanced diagnostic accuracy by integrating various deep learning models via an ensemble approach. Its performance was verified by conducting skin lesion detection experiments using images of skin lesions taken by actual users. Its accuracy and response time were measured using randomly sampled skin disease images. Results revealed that ENSEL achieved high recall in most images and less than 1s s processing speed. This study contributes to the objective diagnosis of skin lesions and promotes the advancement of digital healthcare.</p></details> | <details><summary>16pag...</summary><p>16pages, 14 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[HMR3D: Hierarchical Multimodal Representation for 3D Scene Understanding with Large Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22961v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant promise for 3D scene understanding. Existing VLM-based approaches typically align 3D scene features with the VLM's embedding space. However, this implicit alignment often yields suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of 3D data and the inherent complexity of spatial relationships in 3D environments. To address these limitations, we propose a novel hierarchical multimodal representation for 3D scene reasoning that explicitly aligns with VLMs at the input space by leveraging both multi-view images and text descriptions. The text descriptions capture spatial relationships by referencing the 3D coordinates of detected objects, while the multi-view images include a top-down perspective and four directional views (forward, left, right, and backward), ensuring comprehensive scene coverage. Additionally, we introduce a hierarchical feature representation that aggregates patch-level image features into view-level and scene-level representations, enabling the model to reason over both local and global scene context. Experimental results on both situated 3D Q&A and general 3D Q&A benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Utilizing the real-time detection abilities of YOLOv8, we performed a study aimed at enhancing its talent in swiftly and correctly figuring out objects. Through large training and high-quality-tuning on Kaggle datasets tailored for Barcode and QR code detection, our goal became to optimize YOLOv8's overall performance throughout numerous situations and environments. The look encompasses the assessment of YOLOv8 throughout special version iterations: Nano, Small, and Medium, with a meticulous attention on precision, recall, and F1 assessment metrics. The consequences exhibit large improvements in object detection accuracy with every subsequent model refinement. Specifically, we achieved an accuracy of 88.95% for the nano model, 97.10% for the small model, and 94.10% for the medium version, showcasing the incremental improvements finished via model scaling. Our findings highlight the big strides made through YOLOv8 in pushing the limits of computer vision, ensuring its function as a milestone within the subject of object detection. This study sheds light on how model scaling affects object recognition, increasing the concept of deep learning-based computer creative and prescient techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 Pag...</summary><p>7 Pages, 16 figures, Presented at 2024 International Conference on Emerging Innovations and Advanced Computing (INNOCOMP) Conference</p></details> |
| **[DM$^3$T: Harmonizing Modalities via Diffusion for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22896v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |

How synthetic images can alleviate image scarcity in wildlife surveys: a case study with muskox (Ovibos moschatus)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11882v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate population estimates are essential for wildlife management, providing critical insights into species abundance and distribution. Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency. This approach could be used to initiate ODMs without real data and refine it as real images are acquired over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation</p></details> |

However, most prior approaches update their world representation only at discrete update points such as navigation targets, waypoints, or the end of an action step, leaving robots blind between updates and causing cascading failures: overlooked objects, late error detection, and delayed replanning. To address this limitation, we propose BINDER (Bridging INstant and DEliberative Reasoning), a dual process framework that decouples strategic planning from continuous environment monitoring. Specifically, BINDER integrates a Deliberative Response Module (DRM, a multimodal LLM for task planning) with an Instant Response Module (IRM, a VideoLLM for continuous monitoring). The two modules play complementary roles: the DRM performs strategic planning with structured 3D scene updates and guides what the IRM attends to, while the IRM analyzes video streams to update memory, correct ongoing actions, and trigger replanning when necessary. Through this bidirectional coordination, the modules address the trade off between maintaining awareness and avoiding costly updates, enabling robust adaptation under dynamic conditions. Evaluated in three real world environments with dynamic object placement, BINDER achieves substantially higher success and efficiency than SoTA baselines, demonstrating its effectiveness for real world deployment.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

We propose a novel approach automating high-fidelity video colorization using rich semantic guidance derived from language and segmentation. We employ a language-conditioned diffusion model to colorize grayscale frames. Guidance is provided via automatically generated object masks and textual prompts; our primary automatic method uses a generic prompt, achieving state-of-the-art results without specific color input. Temporal stability is achieved by warping color information from previous frames using optical flow (RAFT); a correction step detects and fixes inconsistencies introduced by warping. Evaluations on standard benchmarks (DAVIS30, VIDEVO20) show our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in colorization accuracy (PSNR) and visual realism (Colorfulness, CDC), demonstrating the efficacy of automated prompt-based guidance for consistent video colorization.</p></details> |  |

In this task, the detection of small objects is particularly difficult. Other than the small size, it is also accompanied by difficulties due to blur, occlusion, and so on. Current small object detection methods are tailored to small and dense situations, such as pedestrians in a crowd or far objects in remote sensing scenarios. However, when the target object is small and sparse, there is a lack of objects available for training, making it more difficult to learn effective features. In this paper, we propose a specialized method for detecting a specific category of small objects; birds. Particularly, we improve the features learned by the neck; the sub-network between the backbone and the prediction head, to learn more effective features with a hierarchical design. We employ Swin Transformer to upsample the image features. Moreover, we change the shifted window size for adapting to small objects. Experiments show that the proposed Swin Transformer-based neck combined with CenterNet can lead to good performance by changing the window sizes. We further find that smaller window sizes (default 2) benefit mAPs for small object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is included in the proceedings of the 18th International Conference on Machine Vision Applications (MVA2023) (https://www.mva-org.jp/mva2023/challenge/index) The paper has received Runner-Up Solution Award (2nd) and Best Booster Award from Small Object Detection Challenge for Spotting Birds 2023 in MVA</p></details> |

However, this tight coupling between virtual and real content makes AR vulnerable to cognitive attacks: manipulations that distort users' semantic understanding of the environment. Existing detection methods largely focus on visual inconsistencies at the pixel or image level, offering limited semantic reasoning or interpretability. To address these limitations, we introduce CADAR, a neuro-symbolic framework for cognitive attack detection in AR that integrates neural and symbolic reasoning. CADAR fuses multimodal vision-language representations from pre-trained models into a perception graph that captures objects, relations, and temporal contextual salience. Building on this structure, a particle-filter-based statistical reasoning module infers anomalies in semantic dynamics to reveal cognitive attacks. This combination provides both the adaptability of modern vision-language models and the interpretability of probabilistic symbolic reasoning. Preliminary experiments on an AR cognitive-attack dataset demonstrate consistent advantages over existing approaches, highlighting the potential of neuro-symbolic methods for robust and interpretable AR security.</p></details> |  |

The proposed approach provides direct information about what the potential use of objects is, as well as guidance on where and how a manipulator should engage, whereas conventional methods treat affordance detection as a semantic segmentation task, focusing solely on answering the what question. To address this gap, we propose a Fusion-based Affordance Keypoint Network (FAKP-Net) by introducing 3D keypoint quadruplet that harnesses the synergistic potential of RGB and Depth image to provide information on execution position, direction, and extent. Benchmark testing demonstrates that FAKP-Net outperforms existing models by significant margins in affordance segmentation task and keypoint detection task.

Most existing methods, based on real-valued modeling or local convolutional operations, are inadequate for capturing the underlying physics of coherent light propagation. Moreover, under low signal-to-noise conditions, these methods often converge to non-physical solutions, severely compromising the stability and reliability of the observation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel physics-driven Wavefront Propagating Compensation Network (WavePCNet) to simulate wavefront propagation and enhance the perception of obscured objects. This WavePCNet integrates the Tri-Phase Wavefront Complex-Propagation Reprojection (TriWCP) to incorporate complex amplitude transfer operators to precisely constrain coherent propagation behavior, along with a momentum memory mechanism to effectively suppress the accumulation of perturbations. Additionally, a High-frequency Cross-layer Compensation Enhancement is introduced to construct frequency-selective pathways with multi-scale receptive fields and dynamically model structural consistency across layers, further boosting the model's robustness and interpretability under complex environmental conditions. Extensive experiments conducted on four physically collected datasets demonstrate that WavePCNet consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across both accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios.

We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF WACV 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear swimming patterns of fish and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios.

| **[DM$^3$T: Harmonizing Modalities via Diffusion for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22896v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. The code and models are available at https://vranlee.github.io/DM-3-T/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Progression of Memory State in Robotic Manipulation: An Object-Centric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11478v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[SlotVLA: Towards Modeling of Object-Relation Representations in Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06754v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by how humans reason over discrete objects and their relationships, we explore whether compact object-centric and object-relation representations can form a foundation for multitask robotic manipulation. Most existing robotic multitask models rely on dense embeddings that entangle both object and background cues, raising concerns about both efficiency and interpretability. In contrast, we study object-relation-centric representations as a pathway to more structured, efficient, and explainable visuomotor control. Our contributions are two-fold. First, we introduce LIBERO+, a fine-grained benchmark dataset designed to enable and evaluate object-relation reasoning in robotic manipulation. Unlike prior datasets, LIBERO+ provides object-centric annotations that enrich demonstrations with box- and mask-level labels as well as instance-level temporal tracking, supporting compact and interpretable visuomotor representations. Second, we propose SlotVLA, a slot-attention-based framework that captures both objects and their relations for action decoding. It uses a slot-based visual tokenizer to maintain consistent temporal object representations, a relation-centric decoder to produce task-relevant embeddings, and an LLM-driven module that translates these embeddings into executable actions. Experiments on LIBERO+ demonstrate that object-centric slot and object-relation slot representations drastically reduce the number of required visual tokens, while providing competitive generalization. Together, LIBERO+ and SlotVLA provide a compact, interpretable, and effective foundation for advancing object-relation-centric robotic manipulation.</p></details> | under review |

Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper, we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture. UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity. The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric design.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures.

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |

How synthetic images can alleviate image scarcity in wildlife surveys: a case study with muskox (Ovibos moschatus)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11882v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate population estimates are essential for wildlife management, providing critical insights into species abundance and distribution. Traditional survey methods, including visual aerial counts and GNSS telemetry tracking, are widely used to monitor muskox populations in Arctic regions. These approaches are resource intensive and constrained by logistical challenges. Advances in remote sensing, artificial intelligence, and high resolution aerial imagery offer promising alternatives for wildlife detection. Yet, the effectiveness of deep learning object detection models (ODMs) is often limited by small datasets, making it challenging to train robust ODMs for sparsely distributed species like muskoxen. This study investigates the integration of synthetic imagery (SI) to supplement limited training data and improve muskox detection in zero shot (ZS) and few-shot (FS) settings. We compared a baseline model trained on real imagery with 5 ZS and 5 FS models that incorporated progressively more SI in the training set. For the ZS models, where no real images were included in the training set, adding SI improved detection performance. As more SI were added, performance in precision, recall and F1 score increased, but eventually plateaued, suggesting diminishing returns when SI exceeded 100% of the baseline model training dataset. For FS models, combining real and SI led to better recall and slightly higher overall accuracy compared to using real images alone, though these improvements were not statistically significant. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SI to train accurate ODMs when data is scarce, offering important perspectives for wildlife monitoring by enabling rare or inaccessible species to be monitored and to increase monitoring frequency. This approach could be used to initiate ODMs without real data and refine it as real images are acquired over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 10 figures, submitted to Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation</p></details> |

The framework enables precise interaction between a humanoid robot and its environment, supporting tasks such as crossing gaps and accurately approaching target objects. Unlike approaches based on full or simplified dynamics, the proposed method avoids complex step planners and analytical models. Step planning is primarily driven by heuristic commands, while a Raibert-type controller modulates the foot placement length based on the error between desired and actual torso velocity. We compare our method with a model-based step-planning approach -- the Linear Inverted Pendulum Model (LIPM) controller. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach attains comparable or superior accuracy in maintaining target velocity (up to 80%), significantly greater robustness on uneven terrain (over 50% improvement), and improved energy efficiency. These results suggest that incorporating complex analytical, model-based components into the training architecture may be unnecessary for achieving stable and robust bipedal walking, even in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

Robotic systems have emerged as transformative solutions to mitigate these inherent limitations. A pivotal moment has arrived, where a confluence of pressing clinical needs and breakthroughs in AI creates an opportunity for a paradigm shift toward Embodied Intelligence (EI), enabling robots to navigate complex vascular networks and adapt to dynamic physiological conditions. Data-driven approaches, leveraging advanced computer vision, medical image analysis, and machine learning, drive this evolution by enabling real-time vessel segmentation, device tracking, and anatomical landmark detection. Reinforcement learning and imitation learning further enhance navigation strategies and replicate expert techniques. This review systematically analyzes the integration of EI into endovascular robotics, identifying profound systemic challenges such as the heterogeneity in validation standards and the gap between human mimicry and machine-native capabilities. Based on this analysis, a conceptual roadmap is proposed that reframes the ultimate objective away from systems that supplant clinical decision-making. This vision of augmented intelligence, where the clinician's role evolves into that of a high-level supervisor, provides a principled foundation for the future of the field.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

The proposed pipeline is designed to enable efficient, close to real-time performance, supporting applications including assistive navigation. To achieve continuous updates of the 3D scene representation, we process the image flow with a sliding window, aligning submaps, thereby overcoming VGGT's high memory demands. We exploit the VGGT tracking head to aggregate 2D semantic instance masks into 3D objects. To allow for temporal consistency and richer contextual reasoning the system stores timestamps and instance-level identities, thereby enabling the detection of changes in the environment. We evaluate the approach on well-known benchmarks and custom datasets specifically designed for assistive navigation scenarios. The results demonstrate the applicability of the framework to real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, current artificial vision systems struggle with persistent, panoramic understanding, often processing scenes egocentrically on a frame-by-frame basis. This limitation is pronounced in the Track Any Point (TAP) task, where existing methods fail to track 2D points outside the field of view. To address this, we introduce TAPVid-360, a novel task that requires predicting the 3D direction to queried scene points across a video sequence, even when far outside the narrow field of view of the observed video. This task fosters learning allocentric scene representations without needing dynamic 4D ground truth scene models for training. Instead, we exploit 360 videos as a source of supervision, resampling them into narrow field-of-view perspectives while computing ground truth directions by tracking points across the full panorama using a 2D pipeline. We introduce a new dataset and benchmark, TAPVid360-10k comprising 10k perspective videos with ground truth directional point tracking. Our baseline adapts CoTracker v3 to predict per-point rotations for direction updates, outperforming existing TAP and TAPVid 3D methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty Quantification for Visual Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21666v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantifying the uncertainty of an object's pose estimate is essential for robust control and planning. Although pose estimation is a well-studied robotics problem, attaching statistically rigorous uncertainty is not well understood without strict distributional assumptions. We develop distribution-free pose uncertainty bounds about a given pose estimate in the monocular setting. Our pose uncertainty only requires high probability noise bounds on pixel detections of 2D semantic keypoints on a known object. This noise model induces an implicit, non-convex set of pose uncertainty constraints. Our key contribution is SLUE (S-Lemma Uncertainty Estimation), a convex program to reduce this set to a single ellipsoidal uncertainty bound that is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. SLUE solves a relaxation of the minimum volume bounding ellipsoid problem inspired by the celebrated S-lemma. It requires no initial guess of the bound's shape or size and is guaranteed to contain the true object pose with high probability. For tighter uncertainty bounds at the same confidence, we extend SLUE to a sum-of-squares relaxation hierarchy which is guaranteed to converge to the minimum volume ellipsoidal uncertainty bound for a given set of keypoint constraints. We show this pose uncertainty bound can easily be projected to independent translation and axis-angle orientation bounds. We evaluate SLUE on two pose estimation datasets and a real-world drone tracking scenario. Compared to prior work, SLUE generates substantially smaller translation bounds and competitive orientation bounds. We release code at https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/PoseUncertaintySets.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21139v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios. Comprehensive experiments validated the challenging nature of our dataset and the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).</p></details> | 19 pages |

Although saliency regularization has emerged as a promising way to achieve this, existing approaches typically require costly supervision such as human gaze data or manual saliency annotations. In contrast, AutoFocus-IL leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to automatically identify and track key objects in demonstrations, generating temporal saliency maps that highlight causal visual signals while suppressing distractors. These maps are then used to regularize behavior cloning policies, yielding stronger alignment between visual attention and task-relevant cues. Experiments in both the CARLA simulator and real-robot manipulation tasks demonstrate that AutoFocus-IL not only outperforms standard behavior cloning but also surpasses state-of-the-art baselines that assume privileged access to human supervision, such as gaze data.

Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the success of integrating detection priors and by the key insight that MOTR-like models are secretly strong detection models, we introduce SelfMOTR, a novel tracking transformer that relies on self-generated detection priors. Through extensive analysis and ablation studies, we uncover and demonstrate the hidden detection capabilities of MOTR-like models, and present a practical set of tools for leveraging them effectively.

In contrast, promptable segmentation models such as SAM2 enable precise user interaction but lack semantic or relational reasoning. We introduce Click2Graph, the first interactive framework for Panoptic Video Scene Graph Generation (PVSG) that unifies visual prompting with spatial, temporal, and semantic understanding. From a single user cue, such as a click or bounding box, Click2Graph segments and tracks the subject across time, autonomously discovers interacting objects, and predicts <subject, object, predicate> triplets to form a temporally consistent scene graph. Our framework introduces two key components: a Dynamic Interaction Discovery Module that generates subject-conditioned object prompts, and a Semantic Classification Head that performs joint entity and predicate reasoning. Experiments on the OpenPVSG benchmark demonstrate that Click2Graph establishes a strong foundation for user-guided PVSG, showing how human prompting can be combined with panoptic grounding and relational inference to enable controllable and interpretable video scene understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains underexplored whether these representations, optimized for multimodal understanding tasks, harbor an inherent potential for visual generation. In this paper, we propose VGT, Visual Generation Tuning, a novel paradigm designed to stimulate the underlying capabilities of visual generation within any vision language models. By performing efficient visual generation tuning on well-pretrained VLMs, we significantly mitigate the alignment costs and accelerate the convergence of autoregressive modeling in the continuous space (20x speedup). Specifically, we dismiss the entangled pixel-level VAEs designed for diffusion transformers and formulate VGT-AE through aligning the semantic encoders from pretrained VLMs with the latent representations of pixel decoders. In image reconstruction tasks, we achieve 26.67 PSNR and 0.50 rFID at a 28x compression ratio, outperforming specialized VAEs; in visual generation tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art outcomes among autoregressive models, 0.77 on GenEval and 78.73 on DPG-Bench. Furthermore, our proposed VGT showcases significant scaling promise and is versatile for endowing any VLMs trained for multimodal understanding with the capabilities of visual generation, which paves the new avenue to explore next-generation unified multimodal foundation models.

However, extending a model's detection capability to new object classes requires large amounts of annotated training data, which is costly and time-consuming to acquire, especially for long-tailed classes with insufficient representation in existing datasets. Here, we introduce the object-centric data setting, when limited data is available in the form of object-centric data (multi-view images or 3D models), and systematically evaluate the performance of four different data synthesis methods to finetune object detection models on novel object categories in this setting. The approaches are based on simple image processing techniques, 3D rendering, and image diffusion models, and use object-centric data to synthesize realistic, cluttered images with varying contextual coherence and complexity. We assess how these methods enable models to achieve category-level generalization in real-world data, and demonstrate significant performance boosts within this data-constrained experimental setting.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

However, current approaches remain limited by rigid action schemas and high annotation costs, restricting their ability to model diverse in-game interactions and player-driven dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Hunyuan-GameCraft-2, a new paradigm of instruction-driven interaction for generative game world modeling. Instead of relying on fixed keyboard inputs, our model allows users to control game video contents through natural language prompts, keyboard, or mouse signals, enabling flexible and semantically rich interaction within generated worlds. We formally defined the concept of interactive video data and developed an automated process to transform large-scale, unstructured text-video pairs into causally aligned interactive datasets. Built upon a 14B image-to-video Mixture-of-Experts(MoE) foundation model, our model incorporates a text-driven interaction injection mechanism for fine-grained control over camera motion, character behavior, and environment dynamics. We introduce an interaction-focused benchmark, InterBench, to evaluate interaction performance comprehensively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model generates temporally coherent and causally grounded interactive game videos that faithfully respond to diverse and free-form user instructions such as "open the door", "draw a torch", or "trigger an explosion".</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, Project page:https://hunyuan-gamecraft-2.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[DisMo: Disentangled Motion Representations for Open-World Motion Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23428v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V) models, have enabled the creation of visually compelling and dynamic videos from simple textual descriptions or initial frames. However, these models often fail to provide an explicit representation of motion separate from content, limiting their applicability for content creators. To address this gap, we propose DisMo, a novel paradigm for learning abstract motion representations directly from raw video data via an image-space reconstruction objective. Our representation is generic and independent of static information such as appearance, object identity, or pose. This enables open-world motion transfer, allowing motion to be transferred across semantically unrelated entities without requiring object correspondences, even between vastly different categories. Unlike prior methods, which trade off motion fidelity and prompt adherence, are overfitting to source structure or drifting from the described action, our approach disentangles motion semantics from appearance, enabling accurate transfer and faithful conditioning. Furthermore, our motion representation can be combined with any existing video generator via lightweight adapters, allowing us to effortlessly benefit from future advancements in video models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through a diverse set of motion transfer tasks. Finally, we show that the learned representations are well-suited for downstream motion understanding tasks, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art video representation models such as V-JEPA in zero-shot action classification on benchmarks including Something-Something v2 and Jester.

CzechLynx contains 39,760 camera trap images annotated with segmentation masks, identity labels, and 20-point skeletons and covers 319 unique individuals across 15 years of systematic monitoring in two geographically distinct regions: southwest Bohemia and the Western Carpathians. In addition to the real camera trap data, we provide a large complementary set of photorealistic synthetic images and a Unity-based generation pipeline with diffusion-based text-to-texture modeling, capable of producing arbitrarily large amounts of synthetic data spanning diverse environments, poses, and coat-pattern variations. To enable systematic testing across realistic ecological scenarios, we define three complementary evaluation protocols: (i) geo-aware, (ii) time-aware open-set, and (iii) time-aware closed-set, covering cross-regional and long-term monitoring settings. With the provided resources, CzechLynx offers a unique, flexible benchmark for robust evaluation of computer vision and machine learning models across realistic ecological scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[VQRAE: Representation Quantization Autoencoders for Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23386v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multimodal understanding, generation and reconstruction representation in a single tokenizer remains a key challenge in building unified models. Previous research predominantly attempts to address this in a dual encoder paradigm, e.g., utilizing the separate encoders for understanding and generation respectively or balancing semantic representations and low-level features with contrastive loss. In this paper, we propose VQRAE, a Vector Quantization version of Representation AutoEncoders, which pioneers the first exploration in unified representation to produce Continuous semantic features for image understanding and Discrete tokens for visual generation within a unified tokenizer. Specifically, we build upon pretrained vision foundation models with a symmetric ViT decoder and adopt a two-stage training strategy: first, it freezes the encoder and learns a high-dimensional semantic VQ codebook with pixel reconstruction objective; then jointly optimizes the encoder with self-distillation constraints. This design enables negligible semantic information for maintaining the ability of multimodal understanding, discrete tokens that are compatible for generation and fine-grained reconstruction. Besides, we identify the intriguing property in quantizing semantic encoders that rely on high-dimensional codebook in contrast to the previous common practice of low-dimensional codebook in image reconstruction. The semantic VQ codebook can achieve a 100% utilization ratio at a dimension of 1536. VQRAE presents competitive performance on several benchmarks of visual understanding, generation and reconstruction with promising scaling property in the autoregressive paradigm for its discrete merits.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |

Existing benchmarks mainly focus on the binary detection of generated images or the localization of manually edited regions and do not reflect the properties of diffusion-based edits, which often blend smoothly into the original content. We present Diffusion-Based Image Editing Area Localization Dataset (DEAL-300K), a large scale dataset for diffusion-based image manipulation localization (DIML) with more than 300,000 annotated images. We build DEAL-300K by using a multi-modal large language model to generate editing instructions, a mask-free diffusion editor to produce manipulated images, and an active-learning change detection pipeline to obtain pixel-level annotations. On top of this dataset, we propose a localization framework that uses a frozen Visual Foundation Model (VFM) together with Multi Frequency Prompt Tuning (MFPT) to capture both semantic and frequency-domain cues of edited regions. Trained on DEAL-300K, our method reaches a pixel-level F1 score of 82.56% on our test split and 80.97% on the external CoCoGlide benchmark, providing strong baselines and a practical foundation for future DIML research.The dataset can be accessed via https://github.com/ymhzyj/DEAL-300K.</p></details> | 13pages,12 figures |

However, existing methods suffer from fragmented task formulations and limited instruction data, hindering effective understanding and generalization. To address these issues, we introduce GeoSeg-1M, the first million-scale dataset for remote sensing instruction-driven segmentation, constructed via an automatic mask filtering and instruction generation pipeline that synthesizes referring, interactive, and reasoning segmentation instructions from multiple public datasets. GeoSeg-1M contains 590K images, 117 categories, and 1.1M image-mask-instruction triplets. Building upon this foundation, we further curate GeoSeg-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to evaluate contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities across diverse instruction-driven tasks and complex geospatial scenes. Furthermore, we present UniGeoSeg, a unified framework that serves as a strong baseline, incorporating task-aware text enhancement, latent knowledge memory, and a progressive training strategy to facilitate multi-task learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of UniGeoSeg across GeoSeg-Bench and diverse public benchmarks, while exhibiting strong zero-shot generalization.

The behavior of these models in terms of significative image features (such as contrast and dispersion) can be difficult to characterize. To cope with this, we propose to use a variational formulation of color contrast enhancement that is inspired by the basic phenomenology of color perception. In particular, we devise a set of basic requirements to be fulfilled by an energy to be considered as `perceptually inspired', showing that there is an explicit class of functionals satisfying all of them. We single out three explicit functionals that we consider of basic interest, showing similarities and differences with existing models. The minima of such functionals is computed using a gradient descent approach. We also present a general methodology to reduce the computational cost of the algorithms under analysis from ${\cal O}(N^2)$ to ${\cal O}(N\log N)$, being $N$ the number of input pixels.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple yet Effective Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Monocular Metric Depth Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14103v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development of \emph{foundation models} for monocular depth estimation such as Depth Anything paved the way to zero-shot monocular depth estimation. Since it returns an affine-invariant disparity map, the favored technique to recover the metric depth consists in fine-tuning the model. However, this stage is not straightforward, it can be costly and time-consuming because of the training and the creation of the dataset. The latter must contain images captured by the camera that will be used at test time and the corresponding ground truth. Moreover, the fine-tuning may also degrade the generalizing capacity of the original model. Instead, we propose in this paper a new method to rescale Depth Anything predictions using 3D points provided by sensors or techniques such as low-resolution LiDAR or structure-from-motion with poses given by an IMU. This approach avoids fine-tuning and preserves the generalizing power of the original depth estimation model while being robust to the noise of the sparse depth, of the camera-LiDAR calibration or of the depth model. Our experiments highlight enhancements relative to zero-shot monocular metric depth estimation methods, competitive results compared to fine-tuned approaches and a better robustness than depth completion approaches.

| **[Entropy Rectifying Guidance for Diffusion and Flow Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13987v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance techniques are commonly used in diffusion and flow models to improve image quality and input consistency for conditional generative tasks such as class-conditional and text-to-image generation. In particular, classifier-free guidance (CFG) is the most widely adopted guidance technique. It results, however, in trade-offs across quality, diversity and consistency: improving some at the expense of others. While recent work has shown that it is possible to disentangle these factors to some extent, such methods come with an overhead of requiring an additional (weaker) model, or require more forward passes per sampling step. In this paper, we propose Entropy Rectifying Guidance (ERG), a simple and effective guidance method based on inference-time changes in the attention mechanism of state-of-the-art diffusion transformer architectures, which allows for simultaneous improvements over image quality, diversity and prompt consistency. ERG is more general than CFG and similar guidance techniques, as it extends to unconditional sampling. We show that ERG results in significant improvements in various tasks, including text-to-image, class-conditional and unconditional image generation. We also show that ERG can be seamlessly combined with other recent guidance methods such as CADS and APG, further improving generation results.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Structured Cognitive Loop for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107v4)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, but their use as autonomous agents introduces architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated the order of the SCL configuration modules to match the diagram</p></details> |

We argue that, compared to solely pursuing a perfect scene representation, it is more critical to enhance the robustness of the rasterization process against parameter errors to ensure stable camera pose tracking. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that leverages a smooth kernel strategy to enhance the robustness of 3DGS-based SLAM. Unlike conventional methods that focus solely on minimizing rendering error, our core insight is to make the rasterization process more resilient to imperfections in the 3DGS parameters. We hypothesize that by allowing each Gaussian to influence a smoother, wider distribution of pixels during rendering, we can mitigate the detrimental effects of parameter noise from outlier Gaussians. This approach intentionally introduces a controlled blur to the rendered image, which acts as a regularization term, stabilizing the subsequent pose optimization. While a complete redesign of the rasterization pipeline is an ideal solution, we propose a practical and effective alternative that is readily integrated into existing 3DGS frameworks. Our method, termed Corrective Blurry KNN (CB-KNN), adaptively modifies the RGB values and locations of the K-nearest neighboring Gaussians within a local region. This dynamic adjustment generates a smoother local rendering, reducing the impact of erroneous GS parameters on the overall image. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach, while maintaining the overall quality of the scene reconstruction (mapping), significantly improves the robustness and accuracy of camera pose tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision Bridge Transformer at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23199v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Vision Bridge Transformer (ViBT), a large-scale instantiation of Brownian Bridge Models designed for conditional generation. Unlike traditional diffusion models that transform noise into data, Bridge Models directly model the trajectory between inputs and outputs, creating an efficient data-to-data translation paradigm. By scaling these models to 20B and 1.3B parameters, we demonstrate their effectiveness for image and video translation tasks. To support this scale, we adopt a Transformer architecture and propose a variance-stabilized velocity-matching objective for robust training. Together, these advances highlight the power of scaling Bridge Models for instruction-based image editing and complex video translation.</p></details> |  |

However, it is challenging for children to clearly grasp these multi level links only through explanations of text or the facilitator's speech. To address this, we developed Colin, an interactive storytelling tool that supports children's multi level narrative skills through both voice and visual modalities. In the generation stage, Colin supports the facilitator to define and review the generated text and image content freely. In the understanding stage, a question feedback model helps children understand multi level connections while co creating stories with Colin. In the building phase, Colin actively encourages children to create connections between elements through drawing and speaking. A user study with 20 participants evaluated Colin by measuring children's engagement, understanding of cause and effect relationships, and the quality of their new story creations. Our results demonstrate that Colin significantly enhances the development of children's narrative skills across multiple levels.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we renovate the pipeline of image-to-3D scene generation by unlocking the potential of geometry models and present our GeoWorld. Instead of exploiting geometric information obtained from a single-frame input, we propose to first generate consecutive video frames and then take advantage of the geometry model to provide full-frame geometry features, which contain richer information than single-frame depth maps or camera embeddings used in previous methods, and use these geometry features as geometrical conditions to aid the video generation model. To enhance the consistency of geometric structures, we further propose a geometry alignment loss to provide the model with real-world geometric constraints and a geometry adaptation module to ensure the effective utilization of geometry features. Extensive experiments show that our GeoWorld can generate high-fidelity 3D scenes from a single image and a given camera trajectory, outperforming prior methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, several challenges remain, including insufficient semantic richness of generated traffic elements, limited camera viewpoints, low visual fidelity of synthesized images, and poor alignment between textual descriptions and generated content. To address these issues, we propose a unified text-driven framework for both image generation and editing, leveraging a controllable mask mechanism to seamlessly integrate the two tasks. Furthermore, we incorporate both vehicle-side and roadside multi-view data to enhance the geometric diversity of traffic scenes. Our training strategy follows a two-stage paradigm: first, we perform conceptual learning using large-scale coarse-grained text-image data; then, we fine-tune with fine-grained descriptive data to enhance text-image alignment and detail quality. Additionally, we introduce a mask-region-weighted loss that dynamically emphasizes small yet critical regions during training, thereby substantially enhancing the generation fidelity of small-scale traffic elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves leading performance in text-based image generation and editing within traffic scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[REVEAL: Reasoning-enhanced Forensic Evidence Analysis for Explainable AI-generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23158v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of generative models, visually realistic AI-generated images have become increasingly difficult to distinguish from authentic ones, posing severe threats to social trust and information integrity. Consequently, there is an urgent need for efficient and truly explainable image forensic methods. Recent detection paradigms have shifted towards explainable forensics. However, state-of-the-art approaches primarily rely on post-hoc rationalizations or visual discrimination, lacking a verifiable chain of evidence. This reliance on surface-level pattern matching limits the generation of causally grounded explanations and often results in poor generalization. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce \textbf{REVEAL-Bench}, the first reasoning-enhanced multimodal benchmark for AI-generated image detection that is explicitly structured around a chain-of-evidence derived from multiple lightweight expert models, then records step-by-step reasoning traces and evidential justifications. Building upon this dataset, we propose \textbf{REVEAL} (\underline{R}easoning-\underline{e}nhanced Forensic E\underline{v}id\underline{e}nce \underline{A}na\underline{l}ysis), an effective and explainable forensic framework that integrates detection with a novel expert-grounded reinforcement learning. Our reward mechanism is specially tailored to jointly optimize detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and logical coherence grounded in explicit forensic evidence, enabling REVEAL to produce fine-grained, interpretable, and verifiable reasoning chains alongside its detection outcomes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that REVEAL significantly enhances detection accuracy, explanation fidelity, and robust cross-model generalization, benchmarking a new state of the art for explainable image forensics.</p></details> |  |

However, current remote sensing foundation models are ill-suited to such inputs: full-image encoding exhausts token and memory budgets, while resize-based preprocessing loses fine-grained and answer-critical details. In this context, guiding the model look where it matters before prediction becomes crucial. Therefore, we present ZoomSearch, a training-free, plug-and-play pipeline that decouples 'where to look' from 'how to answer' for Ultra-HR Remote Sensing Visual Question Answering (RS-VQA). ZoomSearch combines Adaptive Multi-Branch Zoom Search, which performs a hierarchical search over image patches to localize query-relevant regions, with Layout-Aware Patch Reassembly, which reorganizes the selected patches into a compact, layout-faithful canvas. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Ultra-HR RS-VQA benchmarks MME-RealWorld-RS and LRS-VQA, comparing against (i) strong general foundation models, (ii) remote sensing foundation models, (iii) Ultra-HR RS-VQA methods, and (iv) plug-and-play search-based VQA methods. When integrated with LLaVA-ov, ZoomSearch attains state-of-the-art accuracy across diverse tasks, improving the LLaVA-ov baseline by 26.3% on LRS-VQA and 114.8% on MME-RealWorld-RS. Meanwhile, it achieves much higher inference efficiency, outperforming prior search-based methods by 20%~44% in speed.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

However, most existing methods rely on training a single diffusion model, which limits their ability to generate personalized and boundless city-scale scenes. In this paper, we present Yo'City, a novel agentic framework that enables user-customized and infinitely expandable 3D city generation by leveraging the reasoning and compositional capabilities of off-the-shelf large models. Specifically, Yo'City first conceptualize the city through a top-down planning strategy that defines a hierarchical "City-District-Grid" structure. The Global Planner determines the overall layout and potential functional districts, while the Local Designer further refines each district with detailed grid-level descriptions. Subsequently, the grid-level 3D generation is achieved through a "produce-refine-evaluate" isometric image synthesis loop, followed by image-to-3D generation. To simulate continuous city evolution, Yo'City further introduces a user-interactive, relationship-guided expansion mechanism, which performs scene graph-based distance- and semantics-aware layout optimization, ensuring spatially coherent city growth. To comprehensively evaluate our method, we construct a diverse benchmark dataset and design six multi-dimensional metrics that assess generation quality from the perspectives of semantics, geometry, texture, and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Yo'City consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluation aspects.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |

Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Kwai-Kolors/CoTyle Demo: https://huggingface.co/spaces/Kwai-Kolors/CoTyle Homepage: https://kwai-kolors.github.io/CoTyle/</p></details> |

As 3D training data is generally not as sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation. SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for 3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200 dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.6 and +6.8 mAP on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority.</p></details> |  |

Although recent advances have leveraged the knowledge encoded in pre-trained visual models, their effectiveness is constrained by the "affective gap" , limits the applicability of pre-training knowledge for IEC tasks. It has been demonstrated in psychology that language exhibits high variability, encompasses diverse and abundant information, and can effectively eliminate the "affective gap". Inspired by this, we propose a novel Affective Captioning for Image Emotion Classification (ACIEC) to classify image emotion based on pure texts, which effectively capture the affective information in the image. In our method, a hierarchical multi-level contrastive loss is designed for detecting emotional concepts from images, while an emotional attribute chain-of-thought reasoning is proposed to generate affective sentences. Then, a pre-trained language model is leveraged to synthesize emotional concepts and affective sentences to conduct IEC. Additionally, a contrastive loss based on semantic similarity sampling is designed to solve the problem of large intra-class differences and small inter-class differences in affective datasets. Moreover, we also take the images with embedded texts into consideration, which were ignored by previous studies. Extensive experiments illustrate that our method can effectively bridge the affective gap and achieve superior results on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autoregressive Styled Text Image Generation, but Make it Reliable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23240v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing. A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones. Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the textual prompt, improving content adherence.</p></details> | Accepted at WACV2026 |

Unlike jailbreaks or targeted misclassification, the goal is to induce systematic disruption that makes the model generate incoherent or confidently incorrect outputs. Applications include embedding adversarial images into websites to prevent MLLM-powered agents from operating reliably. The proposed attack maximizes next-token entropy using a small ensemble of open-source MLLMs. In the white-box setting, we show that a single adversarial image can disrupt all models in the ensemble, both in the full-image and adversarial CAPTCHA settings. Despite relying on a basic adversarial technique (PGD), the attack generates perturbations that transfer to both unseen open-source (e.g., Qwen3-VL) and proprietary (e.g., GPT-5.1) models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Computational Aspects of Ordered Matching Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23093v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ordered matchings, defined as graphs with linearly ordered vertices, where each vertex is connected to exactly one edge, play a crucial role in the area of ordered graphs and their homomorphisms. Therefore, we consider related problems from the complexity point of view and determine their corresponding computational and parameterized complexities. We show that the subgraph of ordered matchings problem is NP-complete and we prove that the problem of finding ordered homomorphisms between ordered matchings is NP-complete as well, implying NP-completeness of more generic problems. In parameterized complexity setting, we consider a natural choice of parameter - a number of vertices of the image ordered graph. We show that in contrast to the complexity context, finding homomorphisms if the image ordered graph is an ordered matching, this problem parameterized by the number of vertices of the image ordered graph is FPT, which is known to be W[1]-hard for the general problem. We also determine that the problem of core for ordered matchings is solvable in polynomial time which is again in contrast to the NP-completeness of the general problem. We provide several algorithms and generalize some of these problems into ordered graphs with colored edges.</p></details> | Accepted |
