| **[MadCLIP: Few-shot Medical Anomaly Detection with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23810v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation (AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component. The code is available at https://github.com/mahshid1998/MadCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025 (this version is not peer-reviewed; it is the submitted version).

| **[Unifying Biomedical Vision-Language Expertise: Towards a Generalist Foundation Model via Multi-CLIP Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22567v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation. Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9 million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets, encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities. The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction, and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of real-world data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate Heart Rate Measurement from Ultra-Short Video Clips via Periodicity-Guided rPPG Estimation and Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22078v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partial CLIP is Enough: Chimera-Seg for Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22032v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Semantic Segmentation (ZSS) aims to segment both seen and unseen classes using supervision from only seen classes. Beyond adaptation-based methods, distillation-based approaches transfer vision-language alignment of vision-language model, e.g., CLIP, to segmentation models. However, such knowledge transfer remains challenging due to: (1) the difficulty of aligning vision-based features with the textual space, which requires combining spatial precision with vision-language alignment; and (2) the semantic gap between CLIP's global representations and the local, fine-grained features of segmentation models. To address challenge (1), we propose Chimera-Seg, which integrates a segmentation backbone as the body and a CLIP-based semantic head as the head, like the Chimera in Greek mythology, combining spatial precision with vision-language alignment. Specifically, Chimera-Seg comprises a trainable segmentation model and a CLIP Semantic Head (CSH), which maps dense features into the CLIP-aligned space. The CSH incorporates a frozen subnetwork and fixed projection layers from the CLIP visual encoder, along with lightweight trainable components. The partial module from CLIP visual encoder, paired with the segmentation model, retains segmentation capability while easing the mapping to CLIP's semantic space. To address challenge (2), we propose Selective Global Distillation (SGD), which distills knowledge from dense features exhibiting high similarity to the CLIP CLS token, while gradually reducing the number of features used for alignment as training progresses. Besides, we also use a Semantic Alignment Module (SAM) to further align dense visual features with semantic embeddings extracted from the frozen CLIP text encoder. Experiments on two benchmarks show improvements of 0.9% and 1.2% in hIoU.</p></details> |  |
| **[On sharp stable recovery from clipped and folded measurements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20054v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the stability of vector recovery from random linear measurements which have been either clipped or folded. This is motivated by applications where measurement devices detect inputs outside of their effective range. As examples of our main results, we prove sharp lower bounds on the recovery constant for both the declipping and unfolding problems whenever samples are taken according to a uniform distribution on the sphere. Moreover, we show such estimates under (almost) the best possible conditions on both the number of samples and the distribution of the data. We then prove that all of the above results have suitable (effectively) sparse counterparts. In the special case that one restricts the stability analysis to vectors which belong to the unit sphere of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we show that the problem of declipping directly extends the one-bit compressed sensing results of Oymak-Recht and Plan-Vershynin.</p></details> | 33 pages, 2 figures |
| **[ChordPrompt: Orchestrating Cross-Modal Prompt Synergy for Multi-Domain Incremental Learning in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19608v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accept by ECML-PKDD 2025</p></details> |
| **[FineCLIPER: Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with AdaptERs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02157v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (DFER) is crucial for understanding human behavior. However, current methods exhibit limited performance mainly due to the scarcity of high-quality data, the insufficient utilization of facial dynamics, and the ambiguity of expression semantics, etc. To this end, we propose a novel framework, named Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Dynamic Facial Expression Recognition with AdaptERs (FineCLIPER), incorporating the following novel designs: 1) To better distinguish between similar facial expressions, we extend the class labels to textual descriptions from both positive and negative aspects, and obtain supervision by calculating the cross-modal similarity based on the CLIP model; 2) Our FineCLIPER adopts a hierarchical manner to effectively mine useful cues from DFE videos. Specifically, besides directly embedding video frames as input (low semantic level), we propose to extract the face segmentation masks and landmarks based on each frame (middle semantic level) and utilize the Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to further generate detailed descriptions of facial changes across frames with designed prompts (high semantic level). Additionally, we also adopt Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to enable efficient adaptation of large pre-trained models (i.e., CLIP) for this task. Our FineCLIPER achieves SOTA performance on the DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW datasets in both supervised and zero-shot settings with few tunable parameters.

| **[CLIP-GS: CLIP-Informed Gaussian Splatting for View-Consistent 3D Indoor Semantic Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14249v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploiting 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) models for open-vocabulary 3D semantic understanding of indoor scenes has emerged as an attractive research focus. Existing methods typically attach high-dimensional CLIP semantic embeddings to 3D Gaussians and leverage view-inconsistent 2D CLIP semantics as Gaussian supervision, resulting in efficiency bottlenecks and deficient 3D semantic consistency. To address these challenges, we present CLIP-GS, efficiently achieving a coherent semantic understanding of 3D indoor scenes via the proposed Semantic Attribute Compactness (SAC) and 3D Coherent Regularization (3DCR). SAC approach exploits the naturally unified semantics within objects to learn compact, yet effective, semantic Gaussian representations, enabling highly efficient rendering (>100 FPS). 3DCR enforces semantic consistency in 2D and 3D domains: In 2D, 3DCR utilizes refined view-consistent semantic outcomes derived from 3DGS to establish cross-view coherence constraints; in 3D, 3DCR encourages features similar among 3D Gaussian primitives associated with the same object, leading to more precise and coherent segmentation results. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method remarkably suppresses existing state-of-the-art approaches, achieving mIoU improvements of 21.20% and 13.05% on ScanNet and Replica datasets, respectively, while maintaining real-time rendering speed. Furthermore, our approach exhibits superior performance even with sparse input data, substantiating its robustness.</p></details> | ACM TOMM 2025 |
| **[Human Action CLIPs: Detecting AI-generated Human Motion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00526v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-generated video generation continues its journey through the uncanny valley to produce content that is increasingly perceptually indistinguishable from reality. To better protect individuals, organizations, and societies from its malicious applications, we describe an effective and robust technique for distinguishing real from AI-generated human motion using multi-modal semantic embeddings. Our method is robust to the types of laundering that typically confound more low- to mid-level approaches, including resolution and compression attacks. This method is evaluated against DeepAction, a custom-built, open-sourced dataset of video clips with human actions generated by seven text-to-video AI models and matching real footage. The dataset is available under an academic license at https://www.huggingface.co/datasets/faridlab/deepaction_v1.</p></details> |  |
| **[BPCLIP: A Bottom-up Image Quality Assessment from Distortion to Semantics Based on CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17969v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Quality Assessment (IQA) aims to evaluate the perceptual quality of images based on human subjective perception. Existing methods generally combine multiscale features to achieve high performance, but most rely on straightforward linear fusion of these features, which may not adequately capture the impact of distortions on semantic content. To address this, we propose a bottom-up image quality assessment approach based on the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP, a recently proposed model that aligns images and text in a shared feature space), named BPCLIP, which progressively extracts the impact of low-level distortions on high-level semantics. Specifically, we utilize an encoder to extract multiscale features from the input image and introduce a bottom-up multiscale cross attention module designed to capture the relationships between shallow and deep features. In addition, by incorporating 40 image quality adjectives across six distinct dimensions, we enable the pre-trained CLIP text encoder to generate representations of the intrinsic quality of the image, thereby strengthening the connection between image quality perception and human language. Our method achieves superior results on most public Full-Reference (FR) and No-Reference (NR) IQA benchmarks, while demonstrating greater robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICME 2025</p></details> |
| **[When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[A CLIP-Powered Framework for Robust and Generalizable Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11215v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale datasets have been pivotal to the advancements of deep learning models in recent years, but training on such large datasets invariably incurs substantial storage and computational overhead. Meanwhile, real-world datasets often contain redundant and noisy data, imposing a negative impact on training efficiency and model performance. Data selection has shown promise in identifying the most representative samples from the entire dataset, which aims to minimize the performance gap with reduced training costs. Existing works typically rely on single-modality information to assign importance scores for individual samples, which may lead to inaccurate assessments, especially when dealing with noisy or corrupted samples. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-powered data selection framework that leverages multimodal information for more robust and generalizable sample selection. Specifically, our framework consists of three key modules-dataset adaptation, sample scoring, and selection optimization-that together harness extensive pre-trained multimodal knowledge to comprehensively assess sample influence and optimize the selection results through multi-objective optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines on various benchmark datasets. Notably, our method effectively removes noisy or damaged samples from the dataset, enabling it to achieve even higher performance with less data. This indicates that it is not only a way to accelerate training but can also improve overall data quality.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 Spotlight |
| **[Extracting Multimodal Learngene in CLIP: Unveiling the Multimodal Generalizable Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16673v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has attracted widespread attention for its multimodal generalizable knowledge, which is significant for downstream tasks. However, the computational overhead of a large number of parameters and large-scale pre-training poses challenges of pre-training a different scale of CLIP. Learngene extracts the generalizable components termed as learngene from an ancestry model and initializes diverse descendant models with it. Previous Learngene paradigms fail to handle the generalizable knowledge in multimodal scenarios. In this paper, we put forward the idea of utilizing a multimodal block to extract the multimodal generalizable knowledge, which inspires us to propose MM-LG (Multimodal Learngene), a novel framework designed to extract and leverage generalizable components from CLIP. Specifically, we first establish multimodal and unimodal blocks to extract the multimodal and unimodal generalizable knowledge in a weighted-sum manner. Subsequently, we employ these components to numerically initialize descendant models of varying scales and modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate MM-LG's effectiveness, which achieves performance gains over existing learngene approaches (e.g.,+3.1% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +4.13% on Flickr30k) and comparable or superior results to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm (e.g.,+1.9% on Oxford-IIIT PET and +3.65% on Flickr30k). Notably, MM-LG requires only around 25% of the parameter storage while reducing around 2.8 times pre-training costs for diverse model scales compared to the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, making it particularly suitable for efficient deployment across diverse downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Adapt Frozen CLIP for Few-Shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17307v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot Test-Time Domain Adaptation focuses on adapting a model at test time to a specific domain using only a few unlabeled examples, addressing domain shift. Prior methods leverage CLIP's strong out-of-distribution (OOD) abilities by generating domain-specific prompts to guide its generalized, frozen features. However, since downstream datasets are not explicitly seen by CLIP, solely depending on the feature space knowledge is constrained by CLIP's prior knowledge. Notably, when using a less robust backbone like ViT-B/16, performance significantly drops on challenging real-world benchmarks. Departing from the state-of-the-art of inheriting the intrinsic OOD capability of CLIP, this work introduces learning directly on the input space to complement the dataset-specific knowledge for frozen CLIP. Specifically, an independent side branch is attached in parallel with CLIP and enforced to learn exclusive knowledge via revert attention. To better capture the dataset-specific label semantics for downstream adaptation, we propose to enhance the inter-dispersion among text features via greedy text ensemble and refinement. The text and visual features are then progressively fused in a domain-aware manner by a generated domain prompt to adapt toward a specific domain. Extensive experiments show our method's superiority on 5 large-scale benchmarks (WILDS and DomainNet), notably improving over smaller networks like ViT-B/16 with gains of \textbf{+5.1} in F1 for iWildCam and \textbf{+3.1\%} in WC Acc for FMoW.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR2...</summary><p>ICLR2025,https://github.com/chi-chi-zx/L2C</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying Structure in CLIP Embeddings: A Statistical Framework for Concept Interpretation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13831v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept-based approaches, which aim to identify human-understandable concepts within a model's internal representations, are a promising method for interpreting embeddings from deep neural network models, such as CLIP. While these approaches help explain model behavior, current methods lack statistical rigor, making it challenging to validate identified concepts and compare different techniques. To address this challenge, we introduce a hypothesis testing framework that quantifies rotation-sensitive structures within the CLIP embedding space. Once such structures are identified, we propose a post-hoc concept decomposition method. Unlike existing approaches, it offers theoretical guarantees that discovered concepts represent robust, reproducible patterns (rather than method-specific artifacts) and outperforms other techniques in terms of reconstruction error. Empirically, we demonstrate that our concept-based decomposition algorithm effectively balances reconstruction accuracy with concept interpretability and helps mitigate spurious cues in data. Applied to a popular spurious correlation dataset, our method yields a 22.6% increase in worst-group accuracy after removing spurious background concepts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distill CLIP (DCLIP): Enhancing Image-Text Retrieval via Cross-Modal Transformer Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21549v4)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Distill CLIP (DCLIP), a fine-tuned variant of the CLIP model that enhances multimodal image-text retrieval while preserving the original model's strong zero-shot classification capabilities. CLIP models are typically constrained by fixed image resolutions and limited context, which can hinder their effectiveness in retrieval tasks that require fine-grained cross-modal understanding. DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student distillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned to produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between YOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans. These semantically and spatially aligned global representations guide the training of a lightweight student model using a hybrid loss that combines contrastive learning and cosine similarity objectives. Despite being trained on only ~67,500 samples curated from MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Conceptual Captions-just a fraction of CLIP's original dataset-DCLIP significantly improves image-text retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MAP), while retaining approximately 94% of CLIP's zero-shot classification performance. These results demonstrate that DCLIP effectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and generalization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and detail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks.

| **[CLIP the Landscape: Automated Tagging of Crowdsourced Landscape Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12214v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a CLIP-based, multi-modal, multi-label classifier for predicting geographical context tags from landscape photos in the Geograph dataset--a crowdsourced image archive spanning the British Isles, including remote regions lacking POIs and street-level imagery. Our approach addresses a Kaggle competition\footnote{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/predict-geographic-context-from-landscape-photos} task based on a subset of Geograph's 8M images, with strict evaluation: exact match accuracy is required across 49 possible tags. We show that combining location and title embeddings with image features improves accuracy over using image embeddings alone. We release a lightweight pipeline\footnote{https://github.com/SpaceTimeLab/ClipTheLandscape} that trains on a modest laptop, using pre-trained CLIP image and text embeddings and a simple classification head. Predicted tags can support downstream tasks such as building location embedders for GeoAI applications, enriching spatial understanding in data-sparse regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[ContextRefine-CLIP for EPIC-KITCHENS-100 Multi-Instance Retrieval Challenge 2025](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10550v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This report presents ContextRefine-CLIP (CR-CLIP), an efficient model for visual-textual multi-instance retrieval tasks. The approach is based on the dual-encoder AVION, on which we introduce a cross-modal attention flow module to achieve bidirectional dynamic interaction and refinement between visual and textual features to generate more context-aware joint representations. For soft-label relevance matrices provided in tasks such as EPIC-KITCHENS-100, CR-CLIP can work with Symmetric Multi-Similarity Loss to achieve more accurate semantic alignment and optimization using the refined features. Without using ensemble learning, the CR-CLIP model achieves 66.78mAP and 82.08nDCG on the EPIC-KITCHENS-100 public leaderboard, which significantly outperforms the baseline model and fully validates its effectiveness in cross-modal retrieval. The code will be released open-source on https://github.com/delCayr/ContextRefine-Clip</p></details> |  |
| **[AniMaker: Automated Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harmonizing and Merging Source Models for CLIP-based Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09446v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information. However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1) sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models, ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Experimental Evaluation of Static Image Sub-Region-Based Search Models Using CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06938v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous, specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation box.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06035v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 3 tabs</p></details> |

While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.</p></details> | ACL main 2025 |

We propose MARBLE, a method for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic, transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass and applicability to painting. Project Page: https://marblecontrol.github.io/</p></details> |  |

Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Inversion turns CLIP into a Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23161v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SPIRAL, a self-play framework where models learn by playing multi-turn, zero-sum games against continuously improving versions of themselves, eliminating the need for human supervision. Through self-play, SPIRAL generates an infinite curriculum of progressively challenging problems as models must constantly adapt to stronger opponents. To enable this self-play training at scale, We implement a fully online, multi-turn, multi-agent reinforcement learning system for LLMs and propose role-conditioned advantage estimation (RAE) to stabilize multi-agent training. Using SPIRAL, self-play on zero-sum games produces reasoning capabilities that transfer broadly. Training Qwen3-4B-Base on Kuhn Poker alone achieves 8.6% improvement on math and 8.4% on general reasoning, outperforming SFT on 25,000 expert game trajectories. Analysis reveals that this transfer occurs through three cognitive patterns: systematic decomposition, expected value calculation, and case-by-case analysis. Multi-game training (TicTacToe, Kuhn Poker, Simple Negotiation) further enhances performance as each game develops distinct reasoning strengths. Applying SPIRAL to a strong reasoning model (DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B) can still lead to 2.0% average improvement. These results demonstrate that zero-sum games naturally develop transferable reasoning capabilities, highlighting a promising direction for autonomous reasoning development.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Scaling Human Judgment in Community Notes with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24118v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper argues for a new paradigm for Community Notes in the LLM era: an open ecosystem where both humans and LLMs can write notes, and the decision of which notes are helpful enough to show remains in the hands of humans. This approach can accelerate the delivery of notes, while maintaining trust and legitimacy through Community Notes' foundational principle: A community of diverse human raters collectively serve as the ultimate evaluator and arbiter of what is helpful. Further, the feedback from this diverse community can be used to improve LLMs' ability to produce accurate, unbiased, broadly helpful notes--what we term Reinforcement Learning from Community Feedback (RLCF). This becomes a two-way street: LLMs serve as an asset to humans--helping deliver context quickly and with minimal effort--while human feedback, in turn, enhances the performance of LLMs. This paper describes how such a system can work, its benefits, key new risks and challenges it introduces, and a research agenda to solve those challenges and realize the potential of this approach.</p></details> |  |

However, complex tasks requiring multi-round retrieval remain challenging, and early attempts tend to be overly optimistic without a good sense of self-skepticism. Current multi-round RAG systems may continue searching even when enough information has already been retrieved, or they may provide incorrect answers without having sufficient information or knowledge. Existing solutions either require large amounts of expensive human-labeled process supervision data or lead to subpar performance. This paper aims to address these limitations by introducing a new framework, SIM-RAG, to explicitly enhance RAG systems' self-awareness and multi-round retrieval capabilities. To train SIM-RAG, we first let a RAG system self-practice multi-round retrieval, augmenting existing question-answer pairs with intermediate inner monologue reasoning steps to generate synthetic training data. For each pair, the system may explore multiple retrieval paths, which are labeled as successful if they reach the correct answer and unsuccessful otherwise. Using this data, we train a lightweight information sufficiency Critic. At inference time, the Critic evaluates whether the RAG system has retrieved sufficient information at each round, guiding retrieval decisions and improving system-level self-awareness through in-context reinforcement learning. Experiments across multiple prominent RAG benchmarks show that SIM-RAG is an effective multi-round RAG solution. Furthermore, this framework is system-efficient, adding a lightweight component to RAG without requiring modifications to existing LLMs or search engines, and data-efficient, eliminating the need for costly human-annotated mid-step retrieval process supervision data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 48th International ACM SIGIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Constructing Non-Markovian Decision Process via History Aggregator](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24026v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of algorithmic decision-making, non-Markovian dynamics manifest as a significant impediment, especially for paradigms such as Reinforcement Learning (RL), thereby exerting far-reaching consequences on the advancement and effectiveness of the associated systems. Nevertheless, the existing benchmarks are deficient in comprehensively assessing the capacity of decision algorithms to handle non-Markovian dynamics. To address this deficiency, we have devised a generalized methodology grounded in category theory. Notably, we established the category of Markov Decision Processes (MDP) and the category of non-Markovian Decision Processes (NMDP), and proved the equivalence relationship between them. This theoretical foundation provides a novel perspective for understanding and addressing non-Markovian dynamics. We further introduced non-Markovianity into decision-making problem settings via the History Aggregator for State (HAS). With HAS, we can precisely control the state dependency structure of decision-making problems in the time series. Our analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in representing a broad range of non-Markovian dynamics. This approach facilitates a more rigorous and flexible evaluation of decision algorithms by testing them in problem settings where non-Markovian dynamics are explicitly constructed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semiparametric Double Reinforcement Learning with Applications to Long-Term Causal Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06926v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Long-term causal effects often must be estimated from short-term data due to limited follow-up in healthcare, economics, and online platforms. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a natural framework for capturing such long-term dynamics through sequences of states, actions, and rewards. Double Reinforcement Learning (DRL) enables efficient inference on policy values in MDPs, but nonparametric implementations require strong intertemporal overlap assumptions and often exhibit high variance and instability. We propose a semiparametric extension of DRL for efficient inference on linear functionals of the Q-function--such as policy values--in infinite-horizon, time-homogeneous MDPs. By imposing structural restrictions on the Q-function, our approach relaxes the strong overlap conditions required by nonparametric methods and improves statistical efficiency. Under model misspecification, our estimators target the functional of the best-approximating Q-function, with only second-order bias. We provide conditions for valid inference using sieve methods and data-driven model selection. A central challenge in DRL is the estimation of nuisance functions, such as density ratios, which often involve difficult minimax optimization. To address this, we introduce a novel plug-in estimator based on isotonic Bellman calibration, which combines fitted Q-iteration with an isotonic regression adjustment. The estimator is debiased without requiring estimation of additional nuisance functions and reduces high-dimensional overlap assumptions to a one-dimensional condition. Bellman calibration extends isotonic calibration--widely used in prediction and classification--to the MDP setting and may be of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably Efficient and Agile Randomized Q-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24005v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Bayesian-based exploration often demonstrates superior empirical performance compared to bonus-based methods in model-based reinforcement learning (RL), its theoretical understanding remains limited for model-free settings. Existing provable algorithms either suffer from computational intractability or rely on stage-wise policy updates which reduce responsiveness and slow down the learning process. In this paper, we propose a novel variant of Q-learning algorithm, refereed to as RandomizedQ, which integrates sampling-based exploration with agile, step-wise, policy updates, for episodic tabular RL. We establish an $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^5SAT})$ regret bound, where $S$ is the number of states, $A$ is the number of actions, $H$ is the episode length, and $T$ is the total number of episodes. In addition, we present a logarithmic regret bound under a mild positive sub-optimality condition on the optimal Q-function. Empirically, RandomizedQ exhibits outstanding performance compared to existing Q-learning variants with both bonus-based and Bayesian-based exploration on standard benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While unstructured narratives offer rich insights into patient and caregiver experiences, manual thematic analysis (TA) remains labor-intensive and unscalable. We propose a fully automated large language model (LLM) pipeline that performs end-to-end TA on clinical narratives, which eliminates the need for manual coding or full transcript review. Our system employs a novel multi-agent framework, where specialized LLM agents assume roles to enhance theme quality and alignment with human analysis. To further improve thematic relevance, we optionally integrate reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). This supports scalable, patient-centered analysis of large qualitative datasets and allows LLMs to be fine-tuned for specific clinical contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ACL 2025 SRW</p></details> |
| **[TTRL: Test-Time Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16084v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates Reinforcement Learning (RL) on data without explicit labels for reasoning tasks in Large Language Models (LLMs). The core challenge of the problem is reward estimation during inference while not having access to ground-truth information. While this setting appears elusive, we find that common practices in Test-Time Scaling (TTS), such as majority voting, yield surprisingly effective rewards suitable for driving RL training. In this work, we introduce Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), a novel method for training LLMs using RL on unlabeled data. TTRL enables self-evolution of LLMs by utilizing the priors in the pre-trained models. Our experiments demonstrate that TTRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models. Notably, TTRL boosts the pass@1 performance of Qwen-2.5-Math-7B by approximately 211% on the AIME 2024 with only unlabeled test data. Furthermore, although TTRL is only supervised by the maj@n metric, TTRL has demonstrated performance to consistently surpass the upper limit of the initial model maj@n, and approach the performance of models trained directly on test data with ground-truth labels. Our experimental findings validate the general effectiveness of TTRL across various tasks and highlight TTRL's potential for broader tasks and domains.

| **[Diffusion Models for Robotic Manipulation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08438v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in visual domains such as image and video generation. They have also recently emerged as a promising approach in robotics, especially in robot manipulations. Diffusion models leverage a probabilistic framework, and they stand out with their ability to model multi-modal distributions and their robustness to high-dimensional input and output spaces. This survey provides a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art diffusion models in robotic manipulation, including grasp learning, trajectory planning, and data augmentation. Diffusion models for scene and image augmentation lie at the intersection of robotics and computer vision for vision-based tasks to enhance generalizability and data scarcity. This paper also presents the two main frameworks of diffusion models and their integration with imitation learning and reinforcement learning. In addition, it discusses the common architectures and benchmarks and points out the challenges and advantages of current state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 2 figure, 9 tables</p></details> |

Online repair plays a crucial role in mitigating such limitations, ensuring the runtime safety and reliability of ADSs. Existing online repair solutions enforce ADS compliance by transforming unacceptable trajectories into acceptable ones based on predefined specifications, such as rule-based constraints or training datasets. However, these approaches often lack generalizability, adaptability and tend to be overly conservative, resulting in ineffective repairs that not only fail to mitigate safety risks sufficiently but also degrade the overall driving experience. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Decision Repair (ADReFT), a novel and effective repair method that identifies safety-critical states through offline learning from failed tests and generates appropriate mitigation actions to improve ADS safety. Specifically, ADReFT incorporates a transformer-based model with two joint heads, State Monitor and Decision Adapter, designed to capture complex driving environment interactions to evaluate state safety severity and generate adaptive repair actions. Given the absence of oracles for state safety identification, we first pretrain ADReFT using supervised learning with coarse annotations, i.e., labeling states preceding violations as positive samples and others as negative samples. It establishes ADReFT's foundational capability to mitigate safety-critical violations, though it may result in somewhat conservative mitigation strategies. Therefore, we subsequently finetune ADReFT using reinforcement learning to improve its initial capability and generate more precise and contextually appropriate repair decisions. Our evaluation results illustrate that ADReFT achieves better repair performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ego-Foresight: Self-supervised Learning of Agent-Aware Representations for Improved RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01570v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant advancements in Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) observed in the last decade, the amount of training experience necessary to learn effective policies remains one of the primary concerns both in simulated and real environments. Looking to solve this issue, previous work has shown that improved training efficiency can be achieved by separately modeling agent and environment, but usually requiring a supervisory agent mask. In contrast to RL, humans can perfect a new skill from a small number of trials and in most cases do so without a supervisory signal, making neuroscientific studies of human development a valuable source of inspiration for RL. In particular, we explore the idea of motor prediction, which states that humans develop an internal model of themselves and of the consequences that their motor commands have on the immediate sensory inputs. Our insight is that the movement of the agent provides a cue that allows the duality between agent and environment to be learned. To instantiate this idea, we present Ego-Foresight, a self-supervised method for disentangling agent and environment based on motion and prediction. Our main finding is self-supervised agent-awareness by visuomotor prediction of the agent improves sample-efficiency and performance of the underlying RL algorithm. To test our approach, we first study its ability to visually predict agent movement irrespective of the environment, in simulated and real-world robotic data. Then, we integrate Ego-Foresight with a model-free RL algorithm to solve simulated robotic tasks, showing that self-supervised agent-awareness can improve sample-efficiency and performance in RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Synchronised Flow Control in a Dual-Gate Resin Infusion System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23923v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Resin infusion (RI) and resin transfer moulding (RTM) are critical processes for the manufacturing of high-performance fibre-reinforced polymer composites, particularly for large-scale applications such as wind turbine blades. Controlling the resin flow dynamics in these processes is critical to ensure the uniform impregnation of the fibre reinforcements, thereby preventing residual porosities and dry spots that impact the consequent structural integrity of the final component. This paper presents a reinforcement learning (RL) based strategy, established using process simulations, for synchronising the different resin flow fronts in an infusion scenario involving two resin inlets and a single outlet. Using Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO), our approach addresses the challenge of managing the fluid dynamics in a partially observable environment. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL approach in achieving an accurate flow convergence, highlighting its potential towards improving process control and product quality in composites manufacturing.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 45th Ris{\o} International Symposium on Materials Science</p></details> |
| **[The Trilemma of Truth in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23921v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We often attribute human characteristics to large language models (LLMs) and claim that they "know" certain things. LLMs have an internal probabilistic knowledge that represents information retained during training. How can we assess the veracity of this knowledge? We examine two common methods for probing the veracity of LLMs and discover several assumptions that are flawed. To address these flawed assumptions, we introduce sAwMIL (short for Sparse Aware Multiple-Instance Learning), a probing method that utilizes the internal activations of LLMs to separate statements into true, false, and neither. sAwMIL is based on multiple-instance learning and conformal prediction. We evaluate sAwMIL on 5 validity criteria across 16 open-source LLMs, including both default and chat-based variants, as well as on 3 new datasets. Among the insights we provide are: (1) the veracity signal is often concentrated in the third quarter of an LLM's depth; (2) truth and falsehood signals are not always symmetric; (3) linear probes perform better on chat models than on default models; (4) nonlinear probes may be required to capture veracity signals for some LLMs with reinforcement learning from human feedback or knowledge distillation; and (5) LLMs capture a third type of signal that is distinct from true and false and is neither true nor false. These findings provide a reliable method for verifying what LLMs "know" and how certain they are of their probabilistic internal knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeometryZero: Improving Geometry Solving for LLM with Group Contrastive Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07160v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, particularly in mathematical reasoning, amid which geometry problem solving remains a challenging area where auxiliary construction plays a enssential role. Existing approaches either achieve suboptimal performance or rely on massive LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o), incurring massive computational costs. We posit that reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (e.g., GRPO) offers a promising direction for training smaller models that effectively combine auxiliary construction with robust geometric reasoning. However, directly applying GRPO to geometric reasoning presents fundamental limitations due to its dependence on unconditional rewards, which leads to indiscriminate and counterproductive auxiliary constructions. To address these challenges, we propose Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a novel reinforcement learning framework featuring two key innovations: (1) Group Contrastive Masking, which adaptively provides positive or negative reward signals for auxiliary construction based on contextual utility, and a (2) length reward that promotes longer reasoning chains. Building on GCPO, we develop GeometryZero, a family of affordable-size geometric reasoning models that judiciously determine when to employ auxiliary construction. Our extensive empirical evaluation across popular geometric benchmarks (Geometry3K, MathVista) demonstrates that GeometryZero models consistently outperform baselines (e.g. GRPO), achieving an average improvement of 4.29% across all benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Timescale Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning for Unified Behavior and Control of Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23771v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly used in autonomous driving (AD) and shows clear advantages. However, most RL-based AD methods overlook policy structure design. An RL policy that only outputs short-timescale vehicle control commands results in fluctuating driving behavior due to fluctuations in network outputs, while one that only outputs long-timescale driving goals cannot achieve unified optimality of driving behavior and control. Therefore, we propose a multi-timescale hierarchical reinforcement learning approach. Our approach adopts a hierarchical policy structure, where high- and low-level RL policies are unified-trained to produce long-timescale motion guidance and short-timescale control commands, respectively. Therein, motion guidance is explicitly represented by hybrid actions to capture multimodal driving behaviors on structured road and support incremental low-level extend-state updates. Additionally, a hierarchical safety mechanism is designed to ensure multi-timescale safety. Evaluation in simulator-based and HighD dataset-based highway multi-lane scenarios demonstrates that our approach significantly improves AD performance, effectively increasing driving efficiency, action consistency and safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, Submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters</p></details> |
| **[Value-Free Policy Optimization via Reward Partitioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13702v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-trajectory reinforcement learning (RL) methods aim to optimize policies from datasets consisting of (prompt, response, reward) triplets, where scalar rewards are directly available. This supervision format is highly practical, as it mirrors real-world human feedback, such as thumbs-up/down signals, and avoids the need for structured preference annotations. In contrast, pairwise preference-based methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) rely on datasets with both preferred and dispreferred responses, which are harder to construct and less natural to collect. Among single-trajectory approaches, Direct Reward Optimization (DRO) has shown strong empirical performance due to its simplicity and stability. However, DRO requires approximating a value function, which introduces several limitations: high off-policy variance, coupling between policy and value learning, and a lack of absolute supervision on the policy itself. We introduce Reward Partitioning Optimization (RPO), a new method that resolves these limitations by removing the need to model the value function. Instead, RPO normalizes observed rewards using a partitioning approach estimated directly from data. This leads to a straightforward supervised learning objective on the policy, with no auxiliary models and no joint optimization. RPO provides direct and stable supervision on the policy, making it robust and easy to implement in practice. We validate RPO on scalar-feedback language modeling tasks using Flan-T5 encoder-decoder models. Our results demonstrate that RPO outperforms existing single-trajectory baselines such as DRO and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO). These findings confirm that RPO is a simple, effective, and theoretically grounded method for single-trajectory policy optimization.</p></details> |  |

In particular, test-time scaling techniques such as Self-Consistency and Self-Correction can enhance SQL generation accuracy by increasing computational effort during inference. However, these methods have notable limitations: Self-Consistency may select suboptimal outputs despite majority votes, while Self-Correction typically addresses only syntactic errors. To leverage the strengths of both approaches, we propose CSC-SQL, a novel method that integrates Self-Consistency and Self-Correction. CSC-SQL selects the two most frequently occurring outputs from parallel sampling and feeds them into a merge revision model for correction. Additionally, we employ the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm to fine-tune both the SQL generation and revision models via reinforcement learning, significantly enhancing output quality. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness and generalizability of CSC-SQL. On the BIRD private test set, our 7B model achieves 71.72\% execution accuracy, while the 32B model achieves 73.67\%.

We benchmark SmileyLlama by comparing it to CLMs trained from scratch on large amounts of ChEMBL data for their ability to generate valid and novel drug-like molecules. We also use direct preference optimization to both improve SmileyLlama's adherence to a prompt and to generate molecules within the iMiner reinforcement learning framework to predict new drug molecules with optimized 3D conformations and high binding affinity to drug targets, illustrated with the SARS-Cov-2 Main Protease. This overall framework allows a LLM to speak directly as a CLM which can generate molecules with user-specified properties, rather than acting only as a chatbot with knowledge of chemistry or as a helpful virtual assistant. While our dataset and analyses are geared toward drug discovery, this general procedure can be extended to other chemical applications such as chemical synthesis.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we introduce L-Zero (L0), a scalable, end-to-end training pipeline for general-purpose agents. Featuring a low-cost, extensible, and sandboxed concurrent agent worker pool, L0 lowers the barrier for applying reinforcement learning in complex environments. We also introduce NB-Agent, the agent scaffold within L0, which operates in a "code-as-action" fashion via a Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL). We evaluate L0 on factuality question-answering benchmarks. Our experiments demonstrate that a base model can develop robust problem-solving skills using solely Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). On the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, our method boosts accuracy on SimpleQA from 30 % to 80 % and on HotpotQA from 22 % to 41 %.

However, integrating locomotion skills with navigation in quadrupedal robots has not been fully investigated, which holds promise for enhancing long-distance movement capabilities. In this paper, we propose Skill-Nav, a method that incorporates quadrupedal locomotion skills into a hierarchical navigation framework using waypoints as an interface. Specifically, we train a waypoint-guided locomotion policy using deep RL, enabling the robot to autonomously adjust its locomotion skills to reach targeted positions while avoiding obstacles. Compared with direct velocity commands, waypoints offer a simpler yet more flexible interface for high-level planning and low-level control. Utilizing waypoints as the interface allows for the application of various general planning tools, such as large language models (LLMs) and path planning algorithms, to guide our locomotion policy in traversing terrains with diverse obstacles. Extensive experiments conducted in both simulated and real-world scenarios demonstrate that Skill-Nav can effectively traverse complex terrains and complete challenging navigation tasks.</p></details> | 17pages, 6 figures |
| **[Self-correcting Reward Shaping via Language Models for Reinforcement Learning Agents in Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23626v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) in games has gained significant momentum in recent years, enabling the creation of different agent behaviors that can transform a player's gaming experience. However, deploying RL agents in production environments presents two key challenges: (1) designing an effective reward function typically requires an RL expert, and (2) when a game's content or mechanics are modified, previously tuned reward weights may no longer be optimal. Towards the latter challenge, we propose an automated approach for iteratively fine-tuning an RL agent's reward function weights, based on a user-defined language based behavioral goal. A Language Model (LM) proposes updated weights at each iteration based on this target behavior and a summary of performance statistics from prior training rounds. This closed-loop process allows the LM to self-correct and refine its output over time, producing increasingly aligned behavior without the need for manual reward engineering. We evaluate our approach in a racing task and show that it consistently improves agent performance across iterations. The LM-guided agents show a significant increase in performance from $9\%$ to $74\%$ success rate in just one iteration. We compare our LM-guided tuning against a human expert's manual weight design in the racing task: by the final iteration, the LM-tuned agent achieved an $80\%$ success rate, and completed laps in an average of $855$ time steps, a competitive performance against the expert-tuned agent's peak $94\%$ success, and $850$ time steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages in total, 10 pages of main paper, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23601v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diverse decoding of large language models is crucial for applications requiring multiple semantically distinct responses, yet existing methods primarily achieve lexical rather than semantic diversity. This limitation significantly constrains Best-of-N strategies, group-based reinforcement learning, and data synthesis. While temperature sampling and diverse beam search modify token distributions or apply n-gram penalties, they fail to ensure meaningful semantic differentiation. We introduce Semantic-guided Diverse Decoding (SemDiD), operating directly in embedding space that balances quality with diversity through three complementary mechanisms: orthogonal directional guidance, dynamic inter-group repulsion, and position-debiased probability assessment. SemDiD harmonizes these competing objectives using adaptive gain functions and constraint optimization, ensuring both quality thresholds and maximal semantic differentiation. Experiments show SemDiD consistently outperforms existing methods, improving Best-of-N coverage by 1.4-5.2% across diverse tasks and accelerating RLHF training convergence by 15% while increasing accuracy by up to 2.1%.</p></details> |  |
| **[EFRame: Deeper Reasoning via Exploration-Filter-Replay Reinforcement Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22200v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), an efficient variant of PPO that lowers RL's computational cost, still faces limited exploration, low sample efficiency and instability, constraining its performance on complex reasoning tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce EFRame, an Exploration-Filtering-Replay framework that systematically augments GRPO along three critical dimensions. EFRame performs additional rollouts to explore high-quality trajectories, applies online filtering to eliminate low-quality samples that introduce noise and variance, and leverages experience replay to repeatedly exploit rare but informative samples. EFRame establishes a complete and stable learning cycle, guiding the model through a structured transition from exploration to convergence. Our experiments across a variety of reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that EFRame not only improves the robustness and efficiency of training, but also enables access to deeper reasoning capabilities that remain unattainable under vanilla GRPO. Furthermore, EFRame enables a more fine-grained categorization of training samples, allowing for a deeper analysis of how different types of samples contribute to the learning process in RL. Our code is available at https://github.com/597358816/EFRame.</p></details> |  |

In offline RL, reward shaping encounters significant challenges, with past efforts to incorporate prior strategies for uncertainty to improve world models or penalize underexplored state-action pairs. Despite these efforts, a critical gap remains: the simultaneous balancing of intrinsic biases in world models and the diversity of policy recommendations. To address this limitation, we present an innovative offline RL framework termed Reallocated Reward for Recommender Systems (R3S). By integrating inherent model uncertainty to tackle the intrinsic fluctuations in reward predictions, we boost diversity for decision-making to align with a more interactive paradigm, incorporating extra penalizers with decay that deter actions leading to diminished state variety at both local and global scales. The experimental results demonstrate that R3S improves the accuracy of world models and efficiently harmonizes the heterogeneous preferences of the users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Companion Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mesh-Learner: Texturing Mesh with Spherical Harmonics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19938v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a 3D reconstruction and rendering framework termed Mesh-Learner that is natively compatible with traditional rasterization pipelines. It integrates mesh and spherical harmonic (SH) texture (i.e., texture filled with SH coefficients) into the learning process to learn each mesh s view-dependent radiance end-to-end. Images are rendered by interpolating surrounding SH Texels at each pixel s sampling point using a novel interpolation method. Conversely, gradients from each pixel are back-propagated to the related SH Texels in SH textures. Mesh-Learner exploits graphic features of rasterization pipeline (texture sampling, deferred rendering) to render, which makes Mesh-Learner naturally compatible with tools (e.g., Blender) and tasks (e.g., 3D reconstruction, scene rendering, reinforcement learning for robotics) that are based on rasterization pipelines. Our system can train vast, unlimited scenes because we transfer only the SH textures within the frustum to the GPU for training. At other times, the SH textures are stored in CPU RAM, which results in moderate GPU memory usage. The rendering results on interpolation and extrapolation sequences in the Replica and FAST-LIVO2 datasets achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods (e.g., 3D Gaussian Splatting and M2-Mapping). To benefit the society, the code will be available at https://github.com/hku-mars/Mesh-Learner.</p></details> | IROS2025 Accepted |

Compared to traditional 2D ultrasound (US), 3D US can reconstruct the coronal plane, providing a clear visualization of the uterine morphology for assessing CUAs accurately. In this paper, we propose an intelligent system for simultaneous automated plane localization and CUA diagnosis. Our highlights are: 1) we develop a denoising diffusion model with local (plane) and global (volume/text) guidance, using an adaptive weighting strategy to optimize attention allocation to different conditions; 2) we introduce a reinforcement learning-based framework with unsupervised rewards to extract the key slice summary from redundant sequences, fully integrating information across multiple planes to reduce learning difficulty; 3) we provide text-driven uncertainty modeling for coarse prediction, and leverage it to adjust the classification probability for overall performance improvement. Extensive experiments on a large 3D uterine US dataset show the efficacy of our method, in terms of plane localization and CUA diagnosis.

| **[Efficient Online Reinforcement Learning for Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00361v4)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have achieved superior performance in imitation learning and offline reinforcement learning (RL) due to their rich expressiveness. However, the conventional diffusion training procedure requires samples from target distribution, which is impossible in online RL since we cannot sample from the optimal policy. Backpropagating policy gradient through the diffusion process incurs huge computational costs and instability, thus being expensive and not scalable. To enable efficient training of diffusion policies in online RL, we generalize the conventional denoising score matching by reweighting the loss function. The resulting Reweighted Score Matching (RSM) preserves the optimal solution and low computational cost of denoising score matching, while eliminating the need to sample from the target distribution and allowing learning to optimize value functions. We introduce two tractable reweighted loss functions to solve two commonly used policy optimization problems, policy mirror descent and max-entropy policy, resulting in two practical algorithms named Diffusion Policy Mirror Descent (DPMD) and Soft Diffusion Actor-Critic (SDAC). We conducted comprehensive comparisons on MuJoCo benchmarks. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithms outperform recent diffusion-policy online RLs on most tasks, and the DPMD improves more than 120% over soft actor-critic on Humanoid and Ant.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

Although gradient boosting machines and some recent deep models achieve strong performance on tabular data, they often lack interpretability. On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful capabilities to generate human-like reasoning and explanations, but remain under-performed for tabular data prediction. In this paper, we propose a new approach that leverages reasoning-based LLMs, trained using reinforcement learning, to perform more accurate and explainable predictions on tabular data. Our method introduces custom reward functions that guide the model not only toward better prediction accuracy but also toward human-understandable reasons for its predictions. The proposed method is evaluated on financial benchmark datasets and compared against established LLMs.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods often rely on expensive human annotations or large black-box language models, our methodology leverages web data and a teacher LLM to automatically generate high-quality training examples with relevance explanations. By framing document ranking as a reinforcement learning problem and incentivizing explicit reasoning capabilities, we train a compact 3B parameter language model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the BRIGHT benchmark. Our model ranks third on the leaderboard while using substantially fewer parameters than other approaches, outperforming models that are over 20 times larger. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that generating explanations during inference, rather than directly predicting relevance scores, enables more effective reasoning with smaller language models. The self-supervised nature of our method offers a scalable and interpretable solution for modern information retrieval systems.</p></details> |  |

Recent progress in agentic systems, exemplified by Deep Research, underscores the potential for autonomous multi-step research. In this work, we present a cohesive paradigm for building end-to-end agentic information seeking agents from a data-centric and training-stage perspective. Our approach consists of four key stages: (1) browsing data construction, (2) trajectories sampling, (3) supervised fine-tuning for effective cold start, and (4) reinforcement learning for enhanced generalisation. We instantiate this framework in a web agent based on the ReAct, WebDancer. Empirical evaluations on the challenging information seeking benchmarks, GAIA and WebWalkerQA, demonstrate the strong performance of WebDancer, achieving considerable results and highlighting the efficacy of our training paradigm. Further analysis of agent training provides valuable insights and actionable, systematic pathways for developing more capable agentic models.

| **[MedSAM-CA: A CNN-Augmented ViT with Attention-Enhanced Multi-Scale Fusion for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23700v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, where accurate boundary delineation is essential for precise lesion localization, organ identification, and quantitative assessment. In recent years, deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced segmentation accuracy. However, two major challenges remain. First, the performance of these methods heavily relies on large-scale annotated datasets, which are often difficult to obtain in medical scenarios due to privacy concerns and high annotation costs. Second, clinically challenging scenarios, such as low contrast in certain imaging modalities and blurry lesion boundaries caused by malignancy, still pose obstacles to precise segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose MedSAM-CA, an architecture-level fine-tuning approach that mitigates reliance on extensive manual annotations by adapting the pretrained foundation model, Medical Segment Anything (MedSAM). MedSAM-CA introduces two key components: the Convolutional Attention-Enhanced Boundary Refinement Network (CBR-Net) and the Attention-Enhanced Feature Fusion Block (Atte-FFB). CBR-Net operates in parallel with the MedSAM encoder to recover boundary information potentially overlooked by long-range attention mechanisms, leveraging hierarchical convolutional processing. Atte-FFB, embedded in the MedSAM decoder, fuses multi-level fine-grained features from skip connections in CBR-Net with global representations upsampled within the decoder to enhance boundary delineation accuracy. Experiments on publicly available datasets covering dermoscopy, CT, and MRI imaging modalities validate the effectiveness of MedSAM-CA. On dermoscopy dataset, MedSAM-CA achieves 94.43% Dice with only 2% of full training data, reaching 97.25% of full-data training performance, demonstrating strong effectiveness in low-resource clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProSAM: Enhancing the Robustness of SAM-based Visual Reference Segmentation with Probabilistic Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21835v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements in large foundation models have driven the success of open-set image segmentation, a task focused on segmenting objects beyond predefined categories. Among various prompt types (such as points, boxes, texts, and visual references), visual reference segmentation stands out for its unique flexibility and strong zero-shot capabilities. Recently, several SAM-based methods have made notable progress in this task by automatically generating prompts to guide SAM. However, these methods often generate prompts at object boundaries due to suboptimal prompt encoder, which results in instability and reduced robustness. In this work, we introduce ProSAM, a simple but effective method to address the stability challenges we identified in existing SAM-based visual reference segmentation approaches. By learning a variational prompt encoder to predict multivariate prompt distributions, ProSAM avoids generating prompts that lie in unstable regions, overcoming the instability caused by less robust prompts. Our approach consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods on the Pascal-5$^i$ and COCO-20$^i$ datasets, providing a more robust solution for visual reference segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features for Weakly Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23460v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods using class labels often rely on class activation maps (CAMs) to localize objects. However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aggregating Local Saliency Maps for Semi-Global Explainable Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23247v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning dominates image classification tasks, yet understanding how models arrive at predictions remains a challenge. Much research focuses on local explanations of individual predictions, such as saliency maps, which visualise the influence of specific pixels on a model's prediction. However, reviewing many of these explanations to identify recurring patterns is infeasible, while global methods often oversimplify and miss important local behaviours. To address this, we propose Segment Attribution Tables (SATs), a method for summarising local saliency explanations into (semi-)global insights. SATs take image segments (such as "eyes" in Chihuahuas) and leverage saliency maps to quantify their influence. These segments highlight concepts the model relies on across instances and reveal spurious correlations, such as reliance on backgrounds or watermarks, even when out-of-distribution test performance sees little change. SATs can explain any classifier for which a form of saliency map can be produced, using segmentation maps that provide named segments. SATs bridge the gap between oversimplified global summaries and overly detailed local explanations, offering a practical tool for analysing and debugging image classifiers.</p></details> |  |

Accurate segmentation is crucial in radiology, as it aids in the precise localization of abnormalities such as tumors, thereby enabling effective diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring of disease progression. Specifically, the size, shape, and location of tumors can significantly influence clinical decision-making and therapeutic strategies, making accurate segmentation a key component of radiological workflows. However, challenges posed by variations in MRI modalities, image artifacts, and the scarcity of labeled data complicate the segmentation task and impact the performance of traditional models. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel self-supervised learning Multi-encoder nnU-Net architecture designed to process multiple MRI modalities independently through separate encoders. This approach allows the model to capture modality-specific features before fusing them for the final segmentation, thus improving accuracy. Our Multi-encoder nnU-Net demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 93.72%, which surpasses that of other models such as vanilla nnU-Net, SegResNet, and Swin UNETR. By leveraging the unique information provided by each modality, the model enhances segmentation tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited annotated data. Evaluations highlight the effectiveness of this architecture in improving tumor segmentation outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods primarily rely on bounding boxes or point-based prompts, while few have explored text-related prompts, despite clinicians often describing their observations and instructions in natural language. To address this gap, we first propose a RAG-based free-form text prompt generator, that leverages the domain corpus to generate diverse and realistic descriptions. Then, we introduce FLanS, a novel medical image segmentation model that handles various free-form text prompts, including professional anatomy-informed queries, anatomy-agnostic position-driven queries, and anatomy-agnostic size-driven queries. Additionally, our model also incorporates a symmetry-aware canonicalization module to ensure consistent, accurate segmentations across varying scan orientations and reduce confusion between the anatomical position of an organ and its appearance in the scan. FLanS is trained on a large-scale dataset of over 100k medical images from 7 public datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the model's superior language understanding and segmentation precision, along with a deep comprehension of the relationship between them, outperforming SOTA baselines on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 as main content.

This work introduces AugPaint, a data augmentation framework that utilizes inpainting to generate image-label pairs from limited labeled data. AugPaint leverages latent diffusion models, known for their ability to generate high-quality in-domain images with low overhead, and adapts the sampling process for the inpainting task without need for retraining. Specifically, given a pair of image and label mask, we crop the area labeled with the foreground and condition on it during reversed denoising process for every noise level. Masked background area would gradually be filled in, and all generated images are paired with the label mask. This approach ensures the accuracy of match between synthetic images and label masks, setting it apart from existing dataset generation methods. The generated images serve as valuable supervision for training downstream segmentation models, effectively addressing the challenge of limited annotations. We conducted extensive evaluations of our data augmentation method on four public medical image segmentation datasets, including CT, MRI, and skin imaging. Results across all datasets demonstrate that AugPaint outperforms state-of-the-art label-efficient methodologies, significantly improving segmentation performance.</p></details> |  |

Existing works probe into the problem by finetuning Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for segmentation-based output, while still falling short in difficult cases on videos given temporally-sensitive queries, primarily due to the failure to integrate temporal and spatial information. In this paper, we propose ThinkVideo, a novel framework which leverages the zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) capability of MLLM to address these challenges. Specifically, ThinkVideo utilizes the CoT prompts to extract object selectivities associated with particular keyframes, then bridging the reasoning image segmentation model and SAM2 video processor to output mask sequences. The ThinkVideo framework is training-free and compatible with closed-source MLLMs, which can be applied to Reasoning Video Instance Segmentation. We further extend the framework for online video streams, where the CoT is used to update the object of interest when a better target starts to emerge and becomes visible. We conduct extensive experiments on video object segmentation with explicit and implicit queries. The results show that ThinkVideo significantly outperforms previous works in both cases, qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://danielshkao.github.io/thinkvideo.html</p></details> |

To this end, continual test-time adaptation has attracted much attention, aiming to improve detectors' generalization by fine-tuning a few specific parameters, e.g., BatchNorm layers. However, based on a small number of test images, fine-tuning certain parameters may affect the representation ability of other fixed parameters, leading to performance degradation. Instead, we explore a new mechanism, i.e., converting the fine-tuning process to a specific-parameter generation. Particularly, we first design a dual-path LoRA-based domain-aware adapter that disentangles features into domain-invariant and domain-specific components, enabling efficient adaptation. Additionally, a conditional diffusion-based parameter generation mechanism is presented to synthesize the adapter's parameters based on the current environment, preventing the optimization from getting stuck in local optima. Finally, we propose a class-centered optimal transport alignment method to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments conducted on various continuous domain adaptive object detection tasks demonstrate the effectiveness. Meanwhile, visualization results show that the representation extracted by the generated parameters can capture more object-related information and strengthen the generalization ability.</p></details> |  |

However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the $l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, existing event-based object detection datasets are limited in scale, feature large targets size, and lack diverse backgrounds, making them unsuitable for SOD benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce a Event-based Small object detection (EVSOD) dataset (namely EV-UAV), the first large-scale, highly diverse benchmark for anti-UAV tasks. It includes 147 sequences with over 2.3 million event-level annotations, featuring extremely small targets (averaging 6.8 $\times$ 5.4 pixels) and diverse scenarios such as urban clutter and extreme lighting conditions. Furthermore, based on the observation that small moving targets form continuous curves in spatiotemporal event point clouds, we propose Event based Sparse Segmentation Network (EV-SpSegNet), a novel baseline for event segmentation in point cloud space, along with a Spatiotemporal Correlation (STC) loss that leverages motion continuity to guide the network in retaining target events. Extensive experiments on the EV-UAV dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method and provide a benchmark for future research in EVSOD.

Inspired by the success of radiance fields on 3D reconstruction, we assume they can be used to enhance the detector's ability of 3D geometry estimation. However, we observe a decline in detection performance, when we directly use them for 3D rendering as an auxiliary task. From our analysis, we find the performance drop is caused by the strong responses on the background when rendering the whole scene. To address this problem, we propose object-centric radiance fields, focusing on modeling foreground objects while discarding background noises. Specifically, we employ Object-centric Radiance Fields (OcRF) to enhance 3D voxel features via an auxiliary task of rendering foreground objects. We further use opacity - the side-product of rendering- to enhance the 2D foreground BEV features via Height-aware Opacity-based Attention (HOA), where attention maps at different height levels are generated separately via multiple networks in parallel. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes validation and test datasets demonstrate that our OcRFDet achieves superior performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods with 57.2$\%$ mAP and 64.8$\%$ NDS on the nuScenes test benchmark. Code will be available at https://github.com/Mingqj/OcRFDet.</p></details> | Accepted by ICCV2025 |

This study presents a novel approach leveraging the diffusion model Instruct Pix2Pix to develop prompting methodologies that generate realistic datasets with weather-based augmentations aiming to mitigate the impact of adverse weather on the perception capabilities of state-of-the-art object detection models, including Faster R-CNN and YOLOv10. Experiments were conducted in two environments, in the CARLA simulator where an initial evaluation of the proposed data augmentation was provided, and then on the real-world image data sets BDD100K and ACDC demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach in real environments. The key contributions of this work are twofold: (1) identifying and quantifying the performance gap in object detection models under challenging weather conditions, and (2) demonstrating how tailored data augmentation strategies can significantly enhance the robustness of these models. This research establishes a solid foundation for improving the reliability of perception systems in demanding environmental scenarios, and provides a pathway for future advancements in autonomous driving.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[From Sight to Insight: Unleashing Eye-Tracking in Weakly Supervised Video Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23519v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The eye-tracking video saliency prediction (VSP) task and video salient object detection (VSOD) task both focus on the most attractive objects in video and show the result in the form of predictive heatmaps and pixel-level saliency masks, respectively. In practical applications, eye tracker annotations are more readily obtainable and align closely with the authentic visual patterns of human eyes. Therefore, this paper aims to introduce fixation information to assist the detection of video salient objects under weak supervision. On the one hand, we ponder how to better explore and utilize the information provided by fixation, and then propose a Position and Semantic Embedding (PSE) module to provide location and semantic guidance during the feature learning process. On the other hand, we achieve spatiotemporal feature modeling under weak supervision from the aspects of feature selection and feature contrast. A Semantics and Locality Query (SLQ) Competitor with semantic and locality constraints is designed to effectively select the most matching and accurate object query for spatiotemporal modeling. In addition, an Intra-Inter Mixed Contrastive (IIMC) model improves the spatiotemporal modeling capabilities under weak supervision by forming an intra-video and inter-video contrastive learning paradigm. Experimental results on five popular VSOD benchmarks indicate that our model outperforms other competitors on various evaluation metrics.</p></details> | 15 Pages, 9 Figures |

Current methods balance accuracy and computational efficiency, but they have trouble deploying in real-time under low visibility conditions. Through the integration of physics-informed augmentation techniques with the YOLOv12 architecture, this study advances underwater detection. With Residual ELAN blocks to preserve structural features in turbid waters and Area Attention to maintain large receptive fields for occluded objects while reducing computational complexity. Underwater optical properties are addressed by domain-specific augmentations such as turbulence adaptive blurring, biologically grounded occlusion simulation, and spectral HSV transformations for color distortion. Extensive tests on four difficult datasets show state-of-the-art performance, with Brackish data registering 98.30% mAP at 142 FPS. YOLOv12 improves occlusion robustness by 18.9%, small-object recall by 22.4%, and detection precision by up to 7.94% compared to previous models. The crucial role of augmentation strategy is validated by ablation studies. This work offers a precise and effective solution for conservation and underwater robotics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Object Detection using Depth and Image Data for Manufacturing Parts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09062v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manufacturing requires reliable object detection methods for precise picking and handling of diverse types of manufacturing parts and components. Traditional object detection methods utilize either only 2D images from cameras or 3D data from lidars or similar 3D sensors. However, each of these sensors have weaknesses and limitations. Cameras do not have depth perception and 3D sensors typically do not carry color information. These weaknesses can undermine the reliability and robustness of industrial manufacturing systems. To address these challenges, this work proposes a multi-sensor system combining an red-green-blue (RGB) camera and a 3D point cloud sensor. The two sensors are calibrated for precise alignment of the multimodal data captured from the two hardware devices. A novel multimodal object detection method is developed to process both RGB and depth data. This object detector is based on the Faster R-CNN baseline that was originally designed to process only camera images. The results show that the multimodal model significantly outperforms the depth-only and RGB-only baselines on established object detection metrics. More specifically, the multimodal model improves mAP by 13% and raises Mean Precision by 11.8% in comparison to the RGB-only baseline. Compared to the depth-only baseline, it improves mAP by 78% and raises Mean Precision by 57%. Hence, this method facilitates more reliable and robust object detection in service to smart manufacturing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting What Matters: A Novel Approach for Out-of-Distribution 3D Object Detection in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23426v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles (AVs) use object detection models to recognize their surroundings and make driving decisions accordingly. Conventional object detection approaches classify objects into known classes, which limits the AV's ability to detect and appropriately respond to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) objects. This problem is a significant safety concern since the AV may fail to detect objects or misclassify them, which can potentially lead to hazardous situations such as accidents. Consequently, we propose a novel object detection approach that shifts the emphasis from conventional class-based classification to object harmfulness determination. Instead of object detection by their specific class, our method identifies them as either 'harmful' or 'harmless' based on whether they pose a danger to the AV. This is done based on the object position relative to the AV and its trajectory. With this metric, our model can effectively detect previously unseen objects to enable the AV to make safer real-time decisions. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively detects OOD objects, evaluates their harmfulness, and classifies them accordingly, thus enhancing the AV decision-making effectiveness in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Layer Decomposition and Morphological Reconstruction for Task-Oriented Infrared Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23353v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared image helps improve the perception capabilities of autonomous driving in complex weather conditions such as fog, rain, and low light. However, infrared image often suffers from low contrast, especially in non-heat-emitting targets like bicycles, which significantly affects the performance of downstream high-level vision tasks. Furthermore, achieving contrast enhancement without amplifying noise and losing important information remains a challenge. To address these challenges, we propose a task-oriented infrared image enhancement method. Our approach consists of two key components: layer decomposition and saliency information extraction. First, we design an layer decomposition method for infrared images, which enhances scene details while preserving dark region features, providing more features for subsequent saliency information extraction. Then, we propose a morphological reconstruction-based saliency extraction method that effectively extracts and enhances target information without amplifying noise. Our method improves the image quality for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoProg3D: Compositional Visual Reasoning for City-Scale 3D Language Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23352v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of 3D language fields has enabled intuitive interactions with 3D scenes via natural language. However, existing approaches are typically limited to small-scale environments, lacking the scalability and compositional reasoning capabilities necessary for large, complex urban settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose GeoProg3D, a visual programming framework that enables natural language-driven interactions with city-scale high-fidelity 3D scenes. GeoProg3D consists of two key components: (i) a Geography-aware City-scale 3D Language Field (GCLF) that leverages a memory-efficient hierarchical 3D model to handle large-scale data, integrated with geographic information for efficiently filtering vast urban spaces using directional cues, distance measurements, elevation data, and landmark references; and (ii) Geographical Vision APIs (GV-APIs), specialized geographic vision tools such as area segmentation and object detection. Our framework employs large language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines to dynamically combine GV-APIs and operate GCLF, effectively supporting diverse geographic vision tasks. To assess performance in city-scale reasoning, we introduce GeoEval3D, a comprehensive benchmark dataset containing 952 query-answer pairs across five challenging tasks: grounding, spatial reasoning, comparison, counting, and measurement. Experiments demonstrate that GeoProg3D significantly outperforms existing 3D language fields and vision-language models across multiple tasks. To our knowledge, GeoProg3D is the first framework enabling compositional geographic reasoning in high-fidelity city-scale 3D environments via natural language.

However, existing methods struggle with low-light conditions due to issues like indistinct small-object features, limited feature interaction, and poor image quality, which degrade detection accuracy and speed. To address this issue, we propose YOLO-LLTS, an end-to-end real-time traffic sign detection algorithm specifically designed for low-light environments. YOLO-LLTS introduces three main contributions: the High-Resolution Feature Map for Small Object Detection (HRFM-SOD) module to enhance small-object detection by mitigating feature dilution; the Multi-branch Feature Interaction Attention (MFIA) module to improve information extraction through multi-scale features interaction; and the Prior-Guided Feature Enhancement Module (PGFE) to enhance image quality by addressing noise, low contrast, and blurriness. Additionally, we construct a novel dataset, the Chinese Nighttime Traffic Sign Sample Set (CNTSSS), covering diverse nighttime scenarios. Experiments show that YOLO-LLTS achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous best methods by 2.7% mAP50 and 1.6% mAP50:95 on TT100K-night, 1.3% mAP50 and 1.9% mAP50:95 on CNTSSS, 7.5% mAP50 and 9.8% mAP50:95 on GTSDB-night, and superior results on CCTSDB2021.

Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often prioritize inference speed, leading to degraded performance when handling multi-modal inputs. To address this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed to effectively fuse multi-modal information. Specifically, we introduce a dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute module to mitigate information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV object detection tasks.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

However, the computational demands of these models, particularly with large image sizes and multiple transformer layers, pose significant challenges for efficient running on edge devices. Existing pruning and distillation methods either need retraining or are designed for ViT models, which are hard to migrate to 3D detectors. To address this issue, we propose a zero-shot runtime pruning method for transformer decoders in 3D object detection models. The method, termed tgGBC (trim keys gradually Guided By Classification scores), systematically trims keys in transformer modules based on their importance. We expand the classification score to multiply it with the attention map to get the importance score of each key and then prune certain keys after each transformer layer according to their importance scores. Our method achieves a 1.99x speedup in the transformer decoder of the latest ToC3D model, with only a minimal performance loss of less than 1%. Interestingly, for certain models, our method even enhances their performance. Moreover, we deploy 3D detectors with tgGBC on an edge device, further validating the effectiveness of our method.

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-Guard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code will be released at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-Guard</p></details> |  |
| **[Region-Aware CAM: High-Resolution Weakly-Supervised Defect Segmentation via Salient Region Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22866v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface defect detection plays a critical role in industrial quality inspection. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have significantly enhanced the automation level of detection processes. However, conventional semantic segmentation and object detection models heavily rely on large-scale annotated datasets, which conflicts with the practical requirements of defect detection tasks. This paper proposes a novel weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework comprising two key components: a region-aware class activation map (CAM) and pseudo-label training. To address the limitations of existing CAM methods, especially low-resolution thermal maps, and insufficient detail preservation, we introduce filtering-guided backpropagation (FGBP), which refines target regions by filtering gradient magnitudes to identify areas with higher relevance to defects. Building upon this, we further develop a region-aware weighted module to enhance spatial precision. Finally, pseudo-label segmentation is implemented to refine the model's performance iteratively. Comprehensive experiments on industrial defect datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method. The proposed framework effectively bridges the gap between weakly supervised learning and high-precision defect segmentation, offering a practical solution for resource-constrained industrial scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Open world object detection (OWOD) is an emerging area of research that adapts this principle to explore new knowledge. It focuses on recognizing and learning from objects absent from initial training sets, thereby incrementally expanding its knowledge base when new class labels are introduced. This survey paper offers a thorough review of the OWOD domain, covering essential aspects, including problem definitions, benchmark datasets, source codes, evaluation metrics, and a comparative study of existing methods. Additionally, we investigate related areas like open set recognition (OSR) and incremental learning (IL), underlining their relevance to OWOD. Finally, the paper concludes by addressing the limitations and challenges faced by current OWOD algorithms and proposes directions for future research. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive survey of the emerging OWOD field with over one hundred references, marking a significant step forward for object detection technology.

While existing surveys typically focus on isolated aspects of TSS, a comprehensive analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, particularly considering emerging technologies, remains lacking. This paper presents a systematic review of vision technologies in TSS, examining both low-level perception tasks (object detection, classification, and tracking) and high-level perception tasks (parameter estimation, anomaly detection, and behavior understanding). Specifically, we first provide a detailed methodological categorization and comprehensive performance evaluation for each task. Our investigation reveals five fundamental limitations in current TSS: perceptual data degradation in complex scenarios, data-driven learning constraints, semantic understanding gaps, sensing coverage limitations and computational resource demands. To address these challenges, we systematically analyze five categories of current approaches and potential trends: advanced perception enhancement, efficient learning paradigms, knowledge-enhanced understanding, cooperative sensing frameworks and efficient computing frameworks, critically assessing their real-world applicability. Furthermore, we evaluate the transformative potential of foundation models in TSS, which exhibit remarkable zero-shot learning abilities, strong generalization, and sophisticated reasoning capabilities across diverse tasks. This review provides a unified analytical framework bridging low-level and high-level perception tasks, systematically analyzes current limitations and solutions, and presents a structured roadmap for integrating emerging technologies, particularly foundation models, to enhance TSS capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Starting with foreground segmentation tasks, specifically camouflaged object detection (COD) and salient object detection (SOD), our approach enables the LMM to generate point and bounding box prompts in the next-token fashion, which are then used to guide SAM2 in producing segmentation masks. We introduce Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) into the segmentation domain, equipping the LMM with pixel-level comprehension through a carefully designed training strategy. Notably, Seg-R1 achieves remarkable performance with purely RL-based training, achieving .873 S-measure on COD10K without complex model modification. Moreover, we found that pure RL training demonstrates strong open-world generalization. Despite being trained solely on foreground segmentation image-mask pairs without text supervision, Seg-R1 achieves impressive zero-shot performance on referring segmentation and reasoning segmentation tasks, with 71.4 cIoU on RefCOCOg test and 56.7 gIoU on ReasonSeg test, outperforming models fully supervised on these datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> |

This study evaluates defense mechanisms for the YOLOv5 model against such attacks. Optimized adversarial patches were generated and placed in sensitive image regions, by applying EigenCAM and grid search to determine optimal placement. We tested several defenses, including Segment and Complete (SAC), Inpainting, and Latent Diffusion Models. Our pipeline comprises three main stages: patch application, object detection, and defense analysis. Results indicate that adversarial patches reduce average detection confidence by 22.06\%. Defenses restored confidence levels by 3.45\% (SAC), 5.05\% (Inpainting), and significantly improved them by 26.61\%, which even exceeds the original accuracy levels, when using the Latent Diffusion Model, highlighting its superior effectiveness in mitigating the effects of adversarial patches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-disentangled Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space Optimization for Few-shot Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22161v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-shot object detection (FSOD) aims to detect objects with limited samples for novel classes, while relying on abundant data for base classes. Existing FSOD approaches, predominantly built on the Faster R-CNN detector, entangle objectness recognition and foreground classification within shared feature spaces. This paradigm inherently establishes class-specific objectness criteria and suffers from unrepresentative novel class samples. To resolve this limitation, we propose a Uniform Orthogonal Feature Space (UOFS) optimization framework. First, UOFS decouples the feature space into two orthogonal components, where magnitude encodes objectness and angle encodes classification. This decoupling enables transferring class-agnostic objectness knowledge from base classes to novel classes. Moreover, implementing the disentanglement requires careful attention to two challenges: (1) Base set images contain unlabeled foreground instances, causing confusion between potential novel class instances and backgrounds. (2) Angular optimization depends exclusively on base class foreground instances, inducing overfitting of angular distributions to base classes. To address these challenges, we propose a Hybrid Background Optimization (HBO) strategy: (1) Constructing a pure background base set by removing unlabeled instances in original images to provide unbiased magnitude-based objectness supervision. (2) Incorporating unlabeled foreground instances in the original base set into angular optimization to enhance distribution uniformity. Additionally, we propose a Spatial-wise Attention Disentanglement and Association (SADA) module to address task conflicts between class-agnostic and class-specific tasks. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing approaches based on entangled feature spaces.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has focused on enhancing information retrieval for video lectures with advanced navigation, searchability, summarization, as well as question answering chatbots. Visual elements like tables, charts, and illustrations are central to comprehension, retention, and data presentation in lecture videos, yet their full potential for improving access to video content remains underutilized. A major factor is that accurate automatic detection of visual elements in a lecture video is challenging; reasons include i) most visual elements, such as charts, graphs, tables, and illustrations, are artificially created and lack any standard structure, and ii) coherent visual objects may lack clear boundaries and may be composed of connected text and visual components. Despite advancements in deep learning based object detection, current models do not yield satisfactory performance due to the unique nature of visual content in lectures and scarcity of annotated datasets. This paper reports on a transfer learning approach for detecting visual elements in lecture video frames. A suite of state of the art object detection models were evaluated for their performance on lecture video datasets. YOLO emerged as the most promising model for this task. Subsequently YOLO was optimized for lecture video object detection with training on multiple benchmark datasets and deploying a semi-supervised auto labeling strategy. Results evaluate the success of this approach, also in developing a general solution to the problem of object detection in lecture videos. Paper contributions include a publicly released benchmark of annotated lecture video frames, along with the source code to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a paper accepted to MIPR 2025</p></details> |

Open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD), driven by Vision Language Models (VLMs), extends beyond fixed labels but still struggles with domain shifts in indoor environments. We introduce a Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) approach that adapts a pre-trained model without accessing source data. We refine pseudo labels via temporal clustering, employ multi-scale threshold fusion, and apply a Mean Teacher framework with contrastive learning.

However, they often fail when the input imagery is corrupted by motion blur, due to fast motion of the camera or the objects in the scene. This work advances neural rendering techniques in such scenarios by using single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays, an emerging sensing technology capable of sensing images at extremely high speeds. However, the use of SPADs presents its own set of unique challenges in the form of binary images, that are driven by stochastic photon arrivals. To address this, we introduce PhotonSplat, a framework designed to reconstruct 3D scenes directly from SPAD binary images, effectively navigating the noise vs. blur trade-off. Our approach incorporates a novel 3D spatial filtering technique to reduce noise in the renderings. The framework also supports both no-reference using generative priors and reference-based colorization from a single blurry image, enabling downstream applications such as segmentation, object detection and appearance editing tasks. Additionally, we extend our method to incorporate dynamic scene representations, making it suitable for scenes with moving objects. We further contribute PhotonScenes, a real-world multi-view dataset captured with the SPAD sensors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the International Conference on Computational Photography(ICCP) 2025</p></details> |

| **[Visual and Memory Dual Adapter for Multi-Modal Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23972v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt-learning-based multi-modal trackers have achieved promising progress by employing lightweight visual adapters to incorporate auxiliary modality features into frozen foundation models. However, existing approaches often struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency, spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event tracking. Code and models are available at https://github.com/xuboyue1999/mmtrack.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-FETrack V2: Revisiting State Space Model for Frame-Event based Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23783v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework. The source code and pre-trained models will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Mamba_FETrack</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal extension of Mamba-FETrack which was published on Pattern Recognition and Computer Vision (PRCV) 2024</p></details> |
| **[General Compression Framework for Efficient Transformer Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17564v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous works have attempted to improve tracking efficiency through lightweight architecture design or knowledge distillation from teacher models to compact student trackers. However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed to a great extent, and also have the problems of complex training process and structural limitations. Thus, we propose a general model compression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named CompressTracker, to reduce model size while preserving tracking accuracy. Our approach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer layers of the teacher model into distinct stages to break the limitation of model structure. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training technique that randomly substitutes specific stages in the student model with those from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in isolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to replicate the teacher model's behavior and simplifies the training process. To further forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate prediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional supervision during the teacher model's compression process. CompressTracker is structurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture. We conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our CompressTracker. Our CompressTracker-SUTrack, compressed from SUTrack, retains about 99 performance on LaSOT (72.2 AUC) while achieves 2.42x speed up. Code is available at https://github.com/LingyiHongfd/CompressTracker.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Tracking by Detection and Query: An Efficient End-to-End Framework for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06197v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is dominated by two paradigms: tracking-by-detection (TBD) and tracking-by-query (TBQ). While TBD is decoupled and efficient, its fragmented association steps and heuristic matching pipelines often compromise robustness in complex scenarios. TBQ provides stronger semantic modeling through end-to-end learning, but suffers from high training cost and slow inference due to tight coupling between detection and association. To address these challenges, we propose TBDQ-Net, a unified tracking-by-detection-and-query (TBDQ) framework that effectively combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method efficiently integrates pretrained, high-performance detectors with an MOT-tailored associator. The associator is lightweight and directly fetches information from the inference of detectors, enhancing the overall efficiency of the framework. The associator is also learnable, making it essential for fully end-to-end optimization, ensuring robust tracking capabilities. Specifically, the associator comprises two key modules: basic information interaction (BII) for comprehensive semantic interaction, and content-position alignment (CPA) for semantic and positional consistency. TBDQ-Net's effectiveness is extensively demonstrated on DanceTrack, SportsMOT and MOT20 benchmarks. As a structurally efficient and semantically robust tracking framework, it outperforms the leading TBD method by 6.0 IDF1 points on DanceTrack and achieves at least 37.5% faster inference than prominent TBQ methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> |
| **[R1-Track: Direct Application of MLLMs to Visual Object Tracking via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21980v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Event Data Association via Robust Model Fitting for Event-based Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.12962v3)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based approaches, which are based on bio-inspired asynchronous event cameras, have achieved promising performance on various computer vision tasks. However, the study of the fundamental event data association problem is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association (called EDA) approach to explicitly address the event association and fusion problem. The proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the event data, in order to perform unifying data association and information fusion. In EDA, we first asynchronously fuse the event data based on its information entropy. Then, we introduce a deterministic model hypothesis generation strategy, which effectively generates model hypotheses from the fused events, to represent the corresponding event trajectories. After that, we present a two-stage weighting algorithm, which robustly weighs and selects true models from the generated model hypotheses, through multi-structural geometric model fitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an adaptive model selection strategy to automatically determine the number of the true models. Finally, we use the selected true models to associate and fuse the event data, without being affected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios, such as high speed, motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

This work addresses two pivotal challenges, namely, the implementation and the orchestration of the migration process. We first introduce a novel framework that efficiently implements stateful migration and effectively orchestrates the migration process by fulfilling both network and application KPI targets. Through experimental validation using realistic microservices, we then show that our solution (i) greatly improves migration performance, yielding up to 77% decrease of the migration downtime with respect to the state of the art, and (ii) successfully addresses the strict user QoE requirements of critical scenarios featuring latency-sensitive microservices. Further, we consider two practical use cases, featuring, respectively, a UAV autopilot microservice and a multi-object tracking task, and demonstrate how our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in configuring the migration process and in meeting KPI targets.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables. in IEEE Transactions on Network and Service Management (2025)</p></details> |

Despite advancements, unsupervised learning of object representations and dynamics remains challenging. We present VideoPCDNet, an unsupervised framework for object-centric video decomposition and prediction. Our model uses frequency-domain phase correlation techniques to recursively parse videos into object components, which are represented as transformed versions of learned object prototypes, enabling accurate and interpretable tracking. By explicitly modeling object motion through a combination of frequency domain operations and lightweight learned modules, VideoPCDNet enables accurate unsupervised object tracking and prediction of future video frames. In our experiments, we demonstrate that VideoPCDNet outperforms multiple object-centric baseline models for unsupervised tracking and prediction on several synthetic datasets, while learning interpretable object and motion representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for Publication at ICANN 2025</p></details> |

| **[Lightweight RGB-T Tracking with Mobile Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19154v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-modality object tracking (e.g., RGB-only) encounters difficulties in challenging imaging conditions, such as low illumination and adverse weather conditions. To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces effective feature representations that support more accurate target localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed. Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, we present a simple but effective radar-camera matching method, termed RCM, which can be plugged into popular two-stage association trackers. Experimental results utilizing RCM demonstrate the effectiveness of the radar-camera matching in improving object tracking accuracy and reliability for autonomous driving in waterborne environments.

Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.

To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

In comparison to the previous state-of-the-art, KARL (1) incorporates a novel six-stage RL curriculum that doubles the system's motion range, thereby greatly enhancing the system's grasping performance, (2) integrates a robust Kalman filter layer between the perception and reinforcement learning (RL) control modules, enabling the system to maintain an uncertain but continuous 6D pose estimate even when the target object temporarily exits the camera's field-of-view or undergoes rapid, unpredictable motion, and (3) introduces mechanisms to allow retries to gracefully recover from unavoidable policy execution failures. Extensive evaluations conducted in both simulation and real-world experiments qualitatively and quantitatively corroborate KARL's advantage over earlier systems, achieving higher grasp success rates and faster robot execution speed.

This metric builds on the recently introduced probabilistic GOSPA metric to account for both the existence and state estimation uncertainties of individual object states. Similar to trajectory GOSPA (TGOSPA), it can be formulated as a multidimensional assignment problem, and its linear programming relaxation--also a valid metric--is computable in polynomial time. Additionally, this metric retains the interpretability of TGOSPA, and we show that its decomposition yields intuitive costs terms associated to expected localization error and existence probability mismatch error for properly detected objects, expected missed and false detection error, and track switch error. The effectiveness of the proposed metric is demonstrated through a simulation study.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |

The rise of deep learning has significantly advanced MOT, particularly within the tracking-by-detection paradigm, which remains the dominant approach. Advancements in modern deep learning-based methods accelerated in 2022 with the introduction of ByteTrack for tracking-by-detection and MOTR for end-to-end tracking. Our survey provides an in-depth analysis of deep learning-based MOT methods, systematically categorizing tracking-by-detection approaches into five groups: joint detection and embedding, heuristic-based, motion-based, affinity learning, and offline methods. In addition, we examine end-to-end tracking methods and compare them with existing alternative approaches. We evaluate the performance of recent trackers across multiple benchmarks and specifically assess their generality by comparing results across different domains. Our findings indicate that heuristic-based methods achieve state-of-the-art results on densely populated datasets with linear object motion, while deep learning-based association methods, in both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end approaches, excel in scenarios with complex motion patterns.</p></details> | 39 pages |

Over the years, end-to-end methods based on the traditional transformer structure, like MOTR, have achieved remarkable performance in multi-object tracking. However,The substantial computational resource consumption of these methods, coupled with the optimization challenges posed by dynamic data, results in less favorable inference speeds and training times. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper optimized the network architecture and proposed an effective training strategy to mitigate the problem of prolonged training times, thereby developing DecoderTrack, a novel end-to-end tracking method. Subsequently, to tackle the optimization challenges arising from dynamic data, this paper introduced DecoderTrack+ by incorporating a Fixed-Size Query Memory and refining certain attention layers. Our methods, without any bells and whistles, outperforms MOTR on multiple benchmarks, with inference speeds 2.06 and 3.03 times faster than MOTR, respectively</p></details> |  |
| **[Multiple Object Tracking in Video SAR: A Benchmark and Tracking Baseline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12105v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of multi-object tracking using video synthetic aperture radar (Video SAR), Doppler shifts induced by target motion result in artifacts that are easily mistaken for shadows caused by static occlusions. Moreover, appearance changes of the target caused by Doppler mismatch may lead to association failures and disrupt trajectory continuity. A major limitation in this field is the lack of public benchmark datasets for standardized algorithm evaluation. To address the above challenges, we collected and annotated 45 video SAR sequences containing moving targets, and named the Video SAR MOT Benchmark (VSMB). Specifically, to mitigate the effects of trailing and defocusing in moving targets, we introduce a line feature enhancement mechanism that emphasizes the positive role of motion shadows and reduces false alarms induced by static occlusions. In addition, to mitigate the adverse effects of target appearance variations, we propose a motion-aware clue discarding mechanism that substantially improves tracking robustness in Video SAR. The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the VSMB, and the dataset and model are released at https://github.com/softwarePupil/VSMB.</p></details> |  |

Current tracking algorithms can be divided into two main categories: some approaches introduce complex heuristics and re-identification models to improve the tracking accuracy and reduce the number of identification switches, without particular attention to the timing performance, whereas other approaches are aimed at reducing response times by removing the re-identification phase, thus penalizing the tracking accuracy. This work proposes a new approach to multi-class object tracking that allows achieving smaller and more predictable execution times, without penalizing the tracking performance. The idea is to reduce the problem of matching predictions with detections into smaller sub-problems by splitting the Hungarian matrix by class and invoking the second re-identification stage only when strictly necessary for a smaller number of elements. The proposed solution was evaluated in complex urban scenarios with several objects of different types (as cars, trucks, bikes, and pedestrians), showing the effectiveness of the multi-class approach with respect to state of the art trackers.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017.

Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles. By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset, where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks, including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various testing sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops, 3DMM - 3D Multimedia Analytics, Search and Generation</p></details> |

In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |

The proposed framework enables each sensor to operate locally while collaboratively exchanging moment estimates with other sensors, thus eliminating the need to transmit all data to a central processing node. Specifically, we introduce a fast and parallelisable Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling scheme to approximate the tilted distributions, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of expectation propagation updates. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves both communication and inference efficiency for multi-object tracking tasks with dynamic sensor connectivity and varying clutter levels.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contour Errors: An Ego-Centric Metric for Reliable 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04122v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.</p></details> |  |

Predicting player positions in such scenarios is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold. First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes. Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique, SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at CVSports IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW'25).

Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections, low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences, totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios, reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated 14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime scenarios.

Addressing the challenges of precise style control and data dependency in typographic customization, our framework incorporates three key technical contributions. First, we develop a self-distillation mechanism that leverages the pre-trained text-to-image generative model itself alongside the large language model to automatically construct a style-centric typography benchmark. Second, we introduce a localized style injection framework via a trainable style encoder, which comprises both Qformer and linear layers, to extract robust style features from reference images. An in-context generation mechanism is also employed to directly embed reference images into the denoising process, further enhancing the refined alignment of target styles. Extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse fonts and design contexts confirm Calligrapher's accurate reproduction of intricate stylistic details and precise glyph positioning. By automating high-quality, visually consistent typography, Calligrapher surpasses traditional models, empowering creative practitioners in digital art, branding, and contextual typographic design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://calligrapher2025.github.io/Calligrapher Code: https://github.com/Calligrapher2025/Calligrapher</p></details> |

Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) provides a widely used mechanism for steering generation by setting the guidance scale, which balances image quality and prompt alignment. However, the choice of the guidance scale has a critical impact on the convergence toward a visually appealing and prompt-adherent image. In this work, we propose an annealing guidance scheduler which dynamically adjusts the guidance scale over time based on the conditional noisy signal. By learning a scheduling policy, our method addresses the temperamental behavior of CFG. Empirical results demonstrate that our guidance scheduler significantly enhances image quality and alignment with the text prompt, advancing the performance of text-to-image generation. Notably, our novel scheduler requires no additional activations or memory consumption, and can seamlessly replace the common classifier-free guidance, offering an improved trade-off between prompt alignment and quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://annealing-guidance.github.io/annealing-guidance/</p></details> |

However, in practice, cross-modal conceptual blending for humans is prone to cognitive biases, like design fixation, which leads to local minima in the design space. In this paper, we propose a T2I diffusion adapter "IT-Blender" that can automate the blending process to enhance human creativity. Prior works related to cross-modal conceptual blending are limited in encoding a real image without loss of details or in disentangling the image and text inputs. To address these gaps, IT-Blender leverages pretrained diffusion models (SD and FLUX) to blend the latent representations of a clean reference image with those of the noisy generated image. Combined with our novel blended attention, IT-Blender encodes the real reference image without loss of details and blends the visual concept with the object specified by the text in a disentangled way. Our experiment results show that IT-Blender outperforms the baselines by a large margin in blending visual and textual concepts, shedding light on the new application of image generative models to augment human creativity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website is available at https://imagineforme.github.io/</p></details> |

We propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained multimodal image-generation model as a world model to guide policy learning. By exploiting its rich visual-semantic representations and strong generalization across diverse scenes, the model generates open-ended future state predictions that inform downstream manipulation. Coupled with zero-shot low-level control modules, our approach enables general-purpose robotic manipulation without task-specific training. Experiments in both simulation and real-world environments demonstrate that our method achieves effective performance across a wide range of manipulation tasks with no additional data collection or fine-tuning.

Existing methods focus on the integration of diverse generative information into controlling inputs, utilizing frameworks such as GLIGEN or ControlNet, to produce commendable outcomes in controllable generation. However, such approaches intrinsically restrict generation performance to the learning capacities of predefined network architectures. In this paper, we explore the innovative integration of controlling information and introduce PerLDiff (\textbf{Per}spective-\textbf{L}ayout \textbf{Diff}usion Models), a novel method for effective street view image generation that fully leverages perspective 3D geometric information. Our PerLDiff employs 3D geometric priors to guide the generation of street view images with precise object-level control within the network learning process, resulting in a more robust and controllable output. Moreover, it demonstrates superior controllability compared to alternative layout control methods. Empirical results justify that our PerLDiff markedly enhances the precision of controllable generation on the NuScenes and KITTI datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To circumvent these costs, some parties may exploit existing models by using the generated images as training data for their own models. In general, watermarking is a valuable tool for detecting unauthorized use of generated images. However, when these images are used to train a new model, watermarking can only enable detection if the watermark persists through training and remains identifiable in the outputs of the newly trained model - a property known as radioactivity. We analyze the radioactivity of watermarks in images generated by diffusion models (DMs) and image autoregressive models (IARs). We find that existing watermarking methods for DMs fail to retain radioactivity, as watermarks are either erased during encoding into the latent space or lost in the noising-denoising process (during the training in the latent space). Meanwhile, despite IARs having recently surpassed DMs in image generation quality and efficiency, no radioactive watermarking methods have been proposed for them. To overcome this limitation, we propose the first watermarking method tailored for IARs and with radioactivity in mind - drawing inspiration from techniques in large language models (LLMs), which share IARs' autoregressive paradigm. Our extensive experimental evaluation highlights our method's effectiveness in preserving radioactivity within IARs, enabling robust provenance tracking, and preventing unauthorized use of their generated images.</p></details> |  |

Intermediate representations from diffusion models can be leveraged for downstream visual tasks, while self-supervised vision models can enhance the convergence and generation quality of diffusion models. However, transferring pretrained weights from vision models to diffusion models is challenging due to input mismatches and the use of latent spaces. To address these challenges, we propose Unified Self-supervised Pretraining (USP), a framework that initializes diffusion models via masked latent modeling in a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) latent space. USP achieves comparable performance in understanding tasks while significantly improving the convergence speed and generation quality of diffusion models. Our code will be publicly available at https://github.com/AMAP-ML/USP.</p></details> | Accepted to ICCV2025 |

Current approaches either build specialized video models from scratch with enormous computational costs or add separate motion modules to image generators, both requiring learning temporal dynamics anew. We observe that modern image generation models possess underutilized potential in handling structured layouts with implicit temporal understanding. Building on this insight, we introduce GRID, which reformulates temporal sequences as grid layouts, enabling holistic processing of visual sequences while leveraging existing model capabilities. Through a parallel flow-matching training strategy with coarse-to-fine scheduling, our approach achieves up to 67 faster inference speeds while using <1/1000 of the computational resources compared to specialized models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRID not only excels in temporal tasks from Text-to-Video to 3D Editing but also preserves strong performance in image generation, establishing itself as an efficient and versatile omni-solution for visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes: https://github.com/Should-AI-Lab/GRID</p></details> |

However, due to reliance on the discriminative capability of the diffusion model, these diffusion-based methods often struggle to generalize beyond conventional image classification tasks, such as in Deepfake detection. Moreover, traditional strategies for enhancing adversarial example transferability are challenging to adapt to these methods. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework that seamlessly incorporates traditional transferability enhancement strategies into diffusion model-based adversarial example generation via image editing, enabling their application across a wider range of downstream tasks. Our method won first place in the "1st Adversarial Attacks on Deepfake Detectors: A Challenge in the Era of AI-Generated Media" competition at ACM MM25, which validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSF: Efficient Diffusion Model Via Multi-Scale Latent Factorize](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13349v2)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion-based generative models have made significant strides in visual content creation, conventional approaches face computational challenges, especially for high-resolution images, as they denoise the entire image from noisy inputs. This contrasts with signal processing techniques, such as Fourier and wavelet analyses, which often employ hierarchical decompositions. Inspired by such principles, particularly the idea of signal separation, we introduce a diffusion framework leveraging multi-scale latent factorization. Our framework uniquely decomposes the denoising target, typically latent features from a pretrained Variational Autoencoder, into a low-frequency base signal capturing core structural information and a high-frequency residual signal that contributes finer, high-frequency details like textures. This decomposition into base and residual components directly informs our two-stage image generation process, which first produces the low-resolution base, followed by the generation of the high-resolution residual. Our proposed architecture facilitates reduced sampling steps during the residual learning stage, owing to the inherent ease of modeling residual information, which confers advantages over conventional full-resolution generation techniques. This specific approach of decomposing the signal into a base and a residual, conceptually akin to how wavelet analysis can separate different frequency bands, yields a more streamlined and intuitive design distinct from generic hierarchical models. Our method, \name\ (Multi-Scale Factorization), demonstrates its effectiveness by achieving FID scores of 2.08 ($256\times256$) and 2.47 ($512\times512$) on class-conditional ImageNet benchmarks, outperforming the DiT baseline (2.27 and 3.04 respectively) while also delivering a $4\times$ speed-up with the same number of sampling steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAP-Diffusion: Enriching Descriptions with MLLMs for Enhanced Medical Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23641v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the appearance of medical images is influenced by multiple underlying factors, generative models require rich attribute information beyond labels to produce realistic and diverse images. For instance, generating an image of skin lesion with specific patterns demands descriptions that go beyond diagnosis, such as shape, size, texture, and color. However, such detailed descriptions are not always accessible. To address this, we explore a framework, termed Visual Attribute Prompts (VAP)-Diffusion, to leverage external knowledge from pre-trained Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to improve the quality and diversity of medical image generation. First, to derive descriptions from MLLMs without hallucination, we design a series of prompts following Chain-of-Thoughts for common medical imaging tasks, including dermatologic, colorectal, and chest X-ray images. Generated descriptions are utilized during training and stored across different categories. During testing, descriptions are randomly retrieved from the corresponding category for inference. Moreover, to make the generator robust to unseen combination of descriptions at the test time, we propose a Prototype Condition Mechanism that restricts test embeddings to be similar to those from training. Experiments on three common types of medical imaging across four datasets verify the effectiveness of VAP-Diffusion.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we examine whether they can also blend distinct concepts, ranging from concrete objects to intangible ideas, into coherent new visual entities under a zero-shot framework. Specifically, concept blending merges the key attributes of multiple concepts (expressed as textual prompts) into a single, novel image that captures the essence of each concept. We investigate four blending methods, each exploiting different aspects of the diffusion pipeline (e.g., prompt scheduling, embedding interpolation, or layer-wise conditioning). Through systematic experimentation across diverse concept categories, such as merging concrete concepts, synthesizing compound words, transferring artistic styles, and blending architectural landmarks, we show that modern diffusion models indeed exhibit creative blending capabilities without further training or fine-tuning. Our extensive user study, involving 100 participants, reveals that no single approach dominates in all scenarios: each blending technique excels under certain conditions, with factors like prompt ordering, conceptual distance, and random seed affecting the outcome. These findings highlight the remarkable compositional potential of diffusion models while exposing their sensitivity to seemingly minor input variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review</p></details> |

Existing methods typically restrict editing to predetermined viewing angles, severely limiting their flexibility and practical applications. We introduce Edit360, a tuning-free framework that extends 2D modifications to multi-view consistent 3D editing. Built upon video diffusion models, Edit360 enables user-specific editing from arbitrary viewpoints while ensuring structural coherence across all views. The framework selects anchor views for 2D modifications and propagates edits across the entire 360-degree range. To achieve this, Edit360 introduces a novel Anchor-View Editing Propagation mechanism, which effectively aligns and merges multi-view information within the latent and attention spaces of diffusion models. The resulting edited multi-view sequences facilitate the reconstruction of high-quality 3D assets, enabling customizable 3D content creation.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |

Instead of a single patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow, our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$) inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance. Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with small training time.

While diffusion models have driven advancements in novel view synthesis, they still struggle to preserve spatial continuity across views. Diffusion models have been combined with 3D models to address the issue, but such approaches lack efficiency due to their complex multi-step pipelines. This paper proposes a novel view-consistent image generation method which utilizes diffusion models without additional modules. Our key idea is to enhance diffusion models with a training-free method that enables adaptive attention manipulation and noise reinitialization by leveraging view-guided warping to ensure view consistency. Through our comprehensive metric framework suitable for novel-view datasets, we show that our method improves view consistency across various diffusion models, demonstrating its broader applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[FD-DiT: Frequency Domain-Directed Diffusion Transformer for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23466v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) reduces radiation exposure but suffers from image artifacts and loss of detail due to quantum and electronic noise, potentially impacting diagnostic accuracy. Transformer combined with diffusion models has been a promising approach for image generation. Nevertheless, existing methods exhibit limitations in preserving finegrained image details. To address this issue, frequency domain-directed diffusion transformer (FD-DiT) is proposed for LDCT reconstruction. FD-DiT centers on a diffusion strategy that progressively introduces noise until the distribution statistically aligns with that of LDCT data, followed by denoising processing. Furthermore, we employ a frequency decoupling technique to concentrate noise primarily in high-frequency domain, thereby facilitating effective capture of essential anatomical structures and fine details. A hybrid denoising network is then utilized to optimize the overall data reconstruction process. To enhance the capability in recognizing high-frequency noise, we incorporate sliding sparse local attention to leverage the sparsity and locality of shallow-layer information, propagating them via skip connections for improving feature representation. Finally, we propose a learnable dynamic fusion strategy for optimal component integration. Experimental results demonstrate that at identical dose levels, LDCT images reconstructed by FD-DiT exhibit superior noise and artifact suppression compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 11pages, 11 figures |

However, traditional CAM-based methods struggle with partial activations and imprecise object boundaries due to optimization discrepancies between classification and segmentation. Recently, the conditional diffusion model (CDM) has been used as an alternative for generating segmentation masks in WSSS, leveraging its strong image generation capabilities tailored to specific class distributions. By modifying or perturbing the condition during diffusion sampling, the related objects can be highlighted in the generated images. Yet, the saliency maps generated by CDMs are prone to noise from background alterations during reverse diffusion. To alleviate the problem, we introduce Contrastive Learning with Diffusion Features (CLDF), a novel method that uses contrastive learning to train a pixel decoder to map the diffusion features from a frozen CDM to a low-dimensional embedding space for segmentation. Specifically, we integrate gradient maps generated from CDM external classifier with CAMs to identify foreground and background pixels with fewer false positives/negatives for contrastive learning, enabling robust pixel embedding learning. Experimental results on four segmentation tasks from two public medical datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathDiff: Histopathology Image Synthesis with Unpaired Text and Mask Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23440v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have shown promise in synthesizing histopathology images to address data scarcity caused by privacy constraints. Diagnostic text reports provide high-level semantic descriptions, and masks offer fine-grained spatial structures essential for representing distinct morphological regions. However, public datasets lack paired text and mask data for the same histopathological images, limiting their joint use in image generation. This constraint restricts the ability to fully exploit the benefits of combining both modalities for enhanced control over semantics and spatial details. To overcome this, we propose PathDiff, a diffusion framework that effectively learns from unpaired mask-text data by integrating both modalities into a unified conditioning space. PathDiff allows precise control over structural and contextual features, generating high-quality, semantically accurate images. PathDiff also improves image fidelity, text-image alignment, and faithfulness, enhancing data augmentation for downstream tasks like nuclei segmentation and classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate its superiority over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Diffusion Training through Parallelization with Truncated Karhunen-Loève Expansion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17657v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion denoising models have become a popular approach for image generation, but they often suffer from slow convergence during training. In this paper, we identify that this slow convergence is partly due to the complexity of the Brownian motion driving the forward-time process. To address this, we represent the Brownian motion using the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion, truncating it to a limited number of eigenfunctions. We propose a novel ordinary differential equation with augmented random initials, termed KL diffusion, as a new forward-time process for training and sampling. By developing an appropriate denoising loss function, we facilitate the integration of our KL-diffusion into existing denoising-based models. Using the widely adopted DDIM framework as our baseline ensures a fair comparison, as our modifications focus solely on the forward process and loss function, leaving the network architecture and sampling methods unchanged. Our method significantly outperforms baseline diffusion models, achieving convergence speeds that are twice faster to reach the best FID score of the baseline and ultimately yielding much lower FID scores. Notably, our approach allows for highly parallelized computation, requires no additional learnable parameters, and can be flexibly integrated into existing diffusion methods. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

However, achieving identity personalization-ensuring that a model consistently generates subject-specific outputs from limited reference images-remains a fundamental challenge. To address this, we introduce Meta-Low-Rank Adaptation (Meta-LoRA), a novel framework that leverages meta-learning to encode domain-specific priors into LoRA-based identity personalization. Our method introduces a structured three-layer LoRA architecture that separates identity-agnostic knowledge from identity-specific adaptation. In the first stage, the LoRA Meta-Down layers are meta-trained across multiple subjects, learning a shared manifold that captures general identity-related features. In the second stage, only the LoRA-Mid and LoRA-Up layers are optimized to specialize on a given subject, significantly reducing adaptation time while improving identity fidelity. To evaluate our approach, we introduce Meta-PHD, a new benchmark dataset for identity personalization, and compare Meta-LoRA against state-of-the-art methods. Our results demonstrate that Meta-LoRA achieves superior identity retention, computational efficiency, and adaptability across diverse identity conditions. Our code, model weights, and dataset are released on barisbatuhan.github.io/Meta-LoRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[CycleVAR: Repurposing Autoregressive Model for Unsupervised One-Step Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23347v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The current conditional autoregressive image generation methods have shown promising results, yet their potential remains largely unexplored in the practical unsupervised image translation domain, which operates without explicit cross-domain correspondences. A critical limitation stems from the discrete quantization inherent in traditional Vector Quantization-based frameworks, which disrupts gradient flow between the Variational Autoencoder decoder and causal Transformer, impeding end-to-end optimization during adversarial training in image space. To tackle this issue, we propose using Softmax Relaxed Quantization, a novel approach that reformulates codebook selection as a continuous probability mixing process via Softmax, thereby preserving gradient propagation. Building upon this differentiable foundation, we introduce CycleVAR, which reformulates image-to-image translation as image-conditional visual autoregressive generation by injecting multi-scale source image tokens as contextual prompts, analogous to prefix-based conditioning in language models. CycleVAR exploits two modes to generate the target image tokens, including (1) serial multi-step generation, enabling iterative refinement across scales, and (2) parallel one-step generation synthesizing all resolution outputs in a single forward pass. Experimental findings indicate that the parallel one-step generation mode attains superior translation quality with quicker inference speed than the serial multi-step mode in unsupervised scenarios. Furthermore, both quantitative and qualitative results indicate that CycleVAR surpasses previous state-of-the-art unsupervised image translation models, \textit{e}.\textit{g}., CycleGAN-Turbo.</p></details> |  |
| **[Composing Parts for Expressive Object Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10197v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image composition and generation are processes where the artists need control over various parts of the generated images. However, the current state-of-the-art generation models, like Stable Diffusion, cannot handle fine-grained part-level attributes in the text prompts. Specifically, when additional attribute details are added to the base text prompt, these text-to-image models either generate an image vastly different from the image generated from the base prompt or ignore the attribute details. To mitigate these issues, we introduce PartComposer, a training-free method that enables image generation based on fine-grained part-level attributes specified for objects in the base text prompt. This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks, we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image. All stages of PartComposer are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model, which enables it to generalize across domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of part-level control provided by PartComposer through qualitative visual examples and quantitative comparisons with contemporary baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page Will Be Here: https://rangwani-harsh.github.io/PartCraft</p></details> |

This issue is exacerbated when inference times by decreasing sampling steps, resulting in less realistic and hazy images. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a novel diffusion model named PixelBoost that underscores the significance of embracing the stochastic nature of Brownian motion in advancing image super-resolution, resulting in a high degree of realism, particularly focusing on texture and edge definitions. By integrating controlled stochasticity into the training regimen, our proposed model avoids convergence to local optima, effectively capturing and reproducing the inherent uncertainty of image textures and patterns. Our proposed model demonstrates superior objective results in terms of learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), lightness order error (LOE), peak signal-to-noise ratio(PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), as well as visual quality. To determine the edge enhancement, we evaluated the gradient magnitude and pixel value, and our proposed model exhibited a better edge reconstruction capability. Additionally, our model demonstrates adaptive learning capabilities by effectively adjusting to Brownian noise patterns and introduces a sigmoidal noise sequencing method that simplifies training, resulting in faster inference speeds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Disrupting Model Merging: A Parameter-Level Defense Without Sacrificing Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07661v2)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging is a technique that combines multiple finetuned models into a single model without additional training, allowing a free-rider to cheaply inherit specialized capabilities. This study investigates methodologies to suppress unwanted model merging by free-riders. Existing methods such as model watermarking or fingerprinting can only detect merging in hindsight. In contrast, we propose a first proactive defense against model merging. Specifically, our defense method modifies the model parameters so that the model is disrupted if the model is merged with any other model, while its functionality is kept unchanged if not merged with others. Our approach consists of two modules, rearranging MLP parameters and scaling attention heads, which push the model out of the shared basin in parameter space, causing the merging performance with other models to degrade significantly. We conduct extensive experiments on image classification, image generation, and text classification to demonstrate that our defense severely disrupts merging while retaining the functionality of the post-protect model. Moreover, we analyze potential adaptive attacks and further propose a dropout-based pruning to improve our proposal's robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[ZipAR: Parallel Auto-regressive Image Generation through Spatial Locality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04062v3)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose ZipAR, a training-free, plug-and-play parallel decoding framework for accelerating auto-regressive (AR) visual generation. The motivation stems from the observation that images exhibit local structures, and spatially distant regions tend to have minimal interdependence. Given a partially decoded set of visual tokens, in addition to the original next-token prediction scheme in the row dimension, the tokens corresponding to spatially adjacent regions in the column dimension can be decoded in parallel, enabling the ``next-set prediction'' paradigm. By decoding multiple tokens simultaneously in a single forward pass, the number of forward passes required to generate an image is significantly reduced, resulting in a substantial improvement in generation efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that ZipAR can reduce the number of model forward passes by up to 91% on the Emu3-Gen model without requiring any additional retraining.

Building on the foundation of the Ovis series, Ovis-U1 incorporates a diffusion-based visual decoder paired with a bidirectional token refiner, enabling image generation tasks comparable to leading models like GPT-4o. Unlike some previous models that use a frozen MLLM for generation tasks, Ovis-U1 utilizes a new unified training approach starting from a language model. Compared to training solely on understanding or generation tasks, unified training yields better performance, demonstrating the enhancement achieved by integrating these two tasks. Ovis-U1 achieves a score of 69.6 on the OpenCompass Multi-modal Academic Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as Ristretto-3B and SAIL-VL-1.5-2B. In text-to-image generation, it excels with scores of 83.72 and 0.89 on the DPG-Bench and GenEval benchmarks, respectively. For image editing, it achieves 4.00 and 6.42 on the ImgEdit-Bench and GEdit-Bench-EN, respectively. As the initial version of the Ovis unified model series, Ovis-U1 pushes the boundaries of multimodal understanding, generation, and editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>A uni...</summary><p>A unified model for multimodal understanding, text-to-image generation, and image editing.

| **[ATTENTION2D: Communication Efficient Distributed Self-Attention Mechanism](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15758v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based models have emerged as a leading architecture for natural language processing, natural language generation, and image generation tasks. A fundamental element of the transformer architecture is self-attention, which allows the model to capture intricate dependencies within the data. However, the self-attention mechanism also incurs significant computational and memory costs, particularly for long sequences. In this paper, we introduce ATTENTION2D, a novel approach that exploits parallelism along two dimensions - query and key/value - of the self-attention operation. This method enables efficient distribution and parallelization of computations across multiple devices. Our approach facilitates asymptotically faster training and inference phases compared to previous methods, without relying on approximations or incurring additional computational or memory overheads. Furthermore, unlike existing techniques that struggle to scale with an increasing number of processing units, our approach effectively scales with additional processing units. Our experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method in improving communication efficiency and scalability. Compared to Ring Attention, our approach demonstrated up to a 5x performance boost on a GPT-3-like model using 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs across 16 nodes, and up to a 9.4x performance boost on 64 NVIDIA H100 GPUs across 64 nodes.</p></details> | Updated Table 1 |

We develop several technical improvements to address existing challenges in Seedream 2.0, including alignment with complicated prompts, fine-grained typography generation, suboptimal visual aesthetics and fidelity, and limited image resolutions. Specifically, the advancements of Seedream 3.0 stem from improvements across the entire pipeline, from data construction to model deployment. At the data stratum, we double the dataset using a defect-aware training paradigm and a dual-axis collaborative data-sampling framework. Furthermore, we adopt several effective techniques such as mixed-resolution training, cross-modality RoPE, representation alignment loss, and resolution-aware timestep sampling in the pre-training phase. During the post-training stage, we utilize diversified aesthetic captions in SFT, and a VLM-based reward model with scaling, thereby achieving outputs that well align with human preferences. Furthermore, Seedream 3.0 pioneers a novel acceleration paradigm. By employing consistent noise expectation and importance-aware timestep sampling, we achieve a 4 to 8 times speedup while maintaining image quality. Seedream 3.0 demonstrates significant improvements over Seedream 2.0: it enhances overall capabilities, in particular for text-rendering in complicated Chinese characters which is important to professional typography generation. In addition, it provides native high-resolution output (up to 2K), allowing it to generate images with high visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Seedr...</summary><p>Seedream 3.0 Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[PoI: A Filter to Extract Pixel of Interest from Novel View Synthesis for Scene Coordinate Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04843v3)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novel View Synthesis (NVS) techniques, notably Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), can augment camera pose estimation by extending and diversifying training data. However, images generated by these methods are often plagued by spatial artifacts such as blurring and ghosting, undermining their reliability as training data for camera pose estimation. This limitation is particularly critical for Scene Coordinate Regression (SCR) methods, which aim at pixel-level 3D coordinate estimation, because rendering artifacts directly lead to estimation inaccuracies. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-criteria filtering mechanism that dynamically identifies and discards suboptimal pixels during training. The dual-criteria filter evaluates two concurrent metrics: (1) real-time SCR reprojection error, and (2) gradient threshold, across the coordinate regression domain. In addition, for visual localization problems in sparse-input scenarios, it becomes even more necessary to use NVS-generated data to assist localization. We design a coarse-to-fine Points of Interest (PoI) variant using sparse-input NVS to solve this problem. Experiments across indoor and outdoor benchmarks confirm our method's efficacy, achieving state-of-the-art localization accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency.</p></details> |  |
