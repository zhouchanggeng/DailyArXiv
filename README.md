| **[Harmonizing and Merging Source Models for CLIP-based Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09446v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP-based domain generalization aims to improve model generalization to unseen domains by leveraging the powerful zero-shot classification capabilities of CLIP and multiple source datasets. Existing methods typically train a single model across multiple source domains to capture domain-shared information. However, this paradigm inherently suffers from two types of conflicts: 1) sample conflicts, arising from noisy samples and extreme domain shifts among sources; and 2) optimization conflicts, stemming from competition and trade-offs during multi-source training. Both hinder the generalization and lead to suboptimal solutions. Recent studies have shown that model merging can effectively mitigate the competition of multi-objective optimization and improve generalization performance. Inspired by these findings, we propose Harmonizing and Merging (HAM), a novel source model merging framework for CLIP-based domain generalization. During the training process of the source models, HAM enriches the source samples without conflicting samples, and harmonizes the update directions of all models. Then, a redundancy-aware historical model merging method is introduced to effectively integrate knowledge across all source models. HAM comprehensively consolidates source domain information while enabling mutual enhancement among source models, ultimately yielding a final model with optimal generalization capabilities. Extensive experiments on five widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Experimental Evaluation of Static Image Sub-Region-Based Search Models Using CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06938v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in multimodal text-image models have enabled effective text-based querying in extensive image collections. While these models show convincing performance for everyday life scenes, querying in highly homogeneous, specialized domains remains challenging. The primary problem is that users can often provide only vague textual descriptions as they lack expert knowledge to discriminate between homogenous entities. This work investigates whether adding location-based prompts to complement these vague text queries can enhance retrieval performance. Specifically, we collected a dataset of 741 human annotations, each containing short and long textual descriptions and bounding boxes indicating regions of interest in challenging underwater scenes. Using these annotations, we evaluate the performance of CLIP when queried on various static sub-regions of images compared to the full image. Our results show that both a simple 3-by-3 partitioning and a 5-grid overlap significantly improve retrieval effectiveness and remain robust to perturbations of the annotation box.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06035v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 6 figures, 3 tabs</p></details> |
| **[CLIPErase: Efficient Unlearning of Visual-Textual Associations in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23330v2)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine unlearning (MU) has gained significant attention as a means to remove specific data from trained models without requiring a full retraining process. While progress has been made in unimodal domains like text and image classification, unlearning in multimodal models remains relatively underexplored. In this work, we address the unique challenges of unlearning in CLIP, a prominent multimodal model that aligns visual and textual representations. We introduce CLIPErase, a novel approach that disentangles and selectively forgets both visual and textual associations, ensuring that unlearning does not compromise model performance. CLIPErase consists of three key modules: a Forgetting Module that disrupts the associations in the forget set, a Retention Module that preserves performance on the retain set, and a Consistency Module that maintains consistency with the original model. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR-100 and Flickr30K datasets across four CLIP downstream tasks demonstrate that CLIPErase effectively forgets designated associations in zero-shot tasks for multimodal samples, while preserving the model's performance on the retain set after unlearning.</p></details> | ACL main 2025 |
| **[MARBLE: Material Recomposition and Blending in CLIP-Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05313v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Editing materials of objects in images based on exemplar images is an active area of research in computer vision and graphics. We propose MARBLE, a method for performing material blending and recomposing fine-grained material properties by finding material embeddings in CLIP-space and using that to control pre-trained text-to-image models. We improve exemplar-based material editing by finding a block in the denoising UNet responsible for material attribution. Given two material exemplar-images, we find directions in the CLIP-space for blending the materials. Further, we can achieve parametric control over fine-grained material attributes such as roughness, metallic, transparency, and glow using a shallow network to predict the direction for the desired material attribute change. We perform qualitative and quantitative analysis to demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method. We also present the ability of our method to perform multiple edits in a single forward pass and applicability to painting. Project Page: https://marblecontrol.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-AE: CLIP-assisted Cross-view Audio-Visual Enhancement for Unsupervised Temporal Action Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23524v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Action Localization (TAL) has garnered significant attention in information retrieval. Existing supervised or weakly supervised methods heavily rely on labeled temporal boundaries and action categories, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Consequently, unsupervised temporal action localization (UTAL) has gained popularity. However, current methods face two main challenges: 1) Classification pre-trained features overly focus on highly discriminative regions; 2) Solely relying on visual modality information makes it difficult to determine contextual boundaries. To address these issues, we propose a CLIP-assisted cross-view audiovisual enhanced UTAL method. Specifically, we introduce visual language pre-training (VLP) and classification pre-training-based collaborative enhancement to avoid excessive focus on highly discriminative regions; we also incorporate audio perception to provide richer contextual boundary information. Finally, we introduce a self-supervised cross-view learning paradigm to achieve multi-view perceptual enhancement without additional annotations. Extensive experiments on two public datasets demonstrate our model's superiority over several state-of-the-art competitors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implicit Inversion turns CLIP into a Decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23161v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is a discriminative model trained to align images and text in a shared embedding space. Due to its multimodal structure, it serves as the backbone of many generative pipelines, where a decoder is trained to map from the shared space back to images. In this work, we show that image synthesis is nevertheless possible using CLIP alone -- without any decoder, training, or fine-tuning. Our approach optimizes a frequency-aware implicit neural representation that encourages coarse-to-fine generation by stratifying frequencies across network layers. To stabilize this inverse mapping, we introduce adversarially robust initialization, a lightweight Orthogonal Procrustes projection to align local text and image embeddings, and a blending loss that anchors outputs to natural image statistics. Without altering CLIP's weights, this framework unlocks capabilities such as text-to-image generation, style transfer, and image reconstruction. These findings suggest that discriminative models may hold untapped generative potential, hidden in plain sight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness in Both Domains: CLIP Needs a Robust Text Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03355v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. When employing our robust CLIP encoders in multimodal retrieval tasks, we improve the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Forgetting of Image Subgroups in CLIP Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03117v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models (FMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot performance across various tasks by leveraging large-scale, unsupervised pre-training. However, they often inherit harmful or unwanted knowledge from noisy internet-sourced datasets, compromising their reliability in real-world applications. Existing model unlearning methods either rely on access to pre-trained datasets or focus on coarse-grained unlearning (e.g., entire classes), leaving a critical gap for fine-grained unlearning. In this paper, we address the challenging scenario of selectively forgetting specific portions of knowledge within a class, without access to pre-trained data, while preserving the model's overall performance. We propose a novel three-stage approach that progressively unlearns targeted knowledge while mitigating over-forgetting. It consists of (1) a forgetting stage to fine-tune the CLIP on samples to be forgotten, (2) a reminding stage to restore performance on retained samples, and (3) a restoring stage to recover zero-shot capabilities using model souping. Additionally, we introduce knowledge distillation to handle the distribution disparity between forgetting, retaining samples, and unseen pre-trained data. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1K, and style datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively unlearns specific subgroups while maintaining strong zero-shot performance on semantically similar subgroups and other categories, significantly outperforming baseline unlearning methods, which lose effectiveness under the CLIP unlearning setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Fi...</summary><p>12 Figures,5 Pages.

| **[Generalized Gradient Norm Clipping & Non-Euclidean $(L_0,L_1)$-Smoothness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01913v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Disparate Impact of Differentially Private Learning through Bounded Adaptive Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01396v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) has become an essential framework for privacy-preserving machine learning. Existing DP learning methods, however, often have disparate impacts on model predictions, e.g., for minority groups. Gradient clipping, which is often used in DP learning, can suppress larger gradients from challenging samples. We show that this problem is amplified by adaptive clipping, which will often shrink the clipping bound to tiny values to match a well-fitting majority, while significantly reducing the accuracy for others. We propose bounded adaptive clipping, which introduces a tunable lower bound to prevent excessive gradient suppression. Our method improves the accuracy of the worst-performing class on average over 10 percentage points on skewed MNIST and Fashion MNIST compared to the unbounded adaptive clipping, and over 5 percentage points over constant clipping.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 under review. 22 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-driven rain perception: Adaptive deraining with pattern-aware network routing and mask-guided cross-attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01366v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing deraining models process all rainy images within a single network. However, different rain patterns have significant variations, which makes it challenging for a single network to handle diverse types of raindrops and streaks. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CLIP-driven rain perception network (CLIP-RPN) that leverages CLIP to automatically perceive rain patterns by computing visual-language matching scores and adaptively routing to sub-networks to handle different rain patterns, such as varying raindrop densities, streak orientations, and rainfall intensity. CLIP-RPN establishes semantic-aware rain pattern recognition through CLIP's cross-modal visual-language alignment capabilities, enabling automatic identification of precipitation characteristics across different rain scenarios. This rain pattern awareness drives an adaptive subnetwork routing mechanism where specialized processing branches are dynamically activated based on the detected rain type, significantly enhancing the model's capacity to handle diverse rainfall conditions. Furthermore, within sub-networks of CLIP-RPN, we introduce a mask-guided cross-attention mechanism (MGCA) that predicts precise rain masks at multi-scale to facilitate contextual interactions between rainy regions and clean background areas by cross-attention. We also introduces a dynamic loss scheduling mechanism (DLS) to adaptively adjust the gradients for the optimization process of CLIP-RPN. Compared with the commonly used $l_1$ or $l_2$ loss, DLS is more compatible with the inherent dynamics of the network training process, thus achieving enhanced outcomes. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, particularly excelling in complex mixed datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distill CLIP (DCLIP): Enhancing Image-Text Retrieval via Cross-Modal Transformer Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21549v3)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Distill CLIP (DCLIP), a fine-tuned variant of the CLIP model that enhances multimodal image-text retrieval while preserving the original model's strong zero-shot classification capabilities. CLIP models are typically constrained by fixed image resolutions and limited context, which can hinder their effectiveness in retrieval tasks that require fine-grained cross-modal understanding. DCLIP addresses these challenges through a meta teacher-student distillation framework, where a cross-modal transformer teacher is fine-tuned to produce enriched embeddings via bidirectional cross-attention between YOLO-extracted image regions and corresponding textual spans. These semantically and spatially aligned global representations guide the training of a lightweight student model using a hybrid loss that combines contrastive learning and cosine similarity objectives. Despite being trained on only ~67,500 samples curated from MSCOCO, Flickr30k, and Conceptual Captions-just a fraction of CLIP's original dataset-DCLIP significantly improves image-text retrieval metrics (Recall@K, MAP), while retaining approximately 94% of CLIP's zero-shot classification performance. These results demonstrate that DCLIP effectively mitigates the trade-off between task specialization and generalization, offering a resource-efficient, domain-adaptive, and detail-sensitive solution for advanced vision-language tasks.

| **[Understanding Model Reprogramming for CLIP via Decoupling Visual Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01000v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reprogramming adapts pretrained models to downstream tasks by modifying only the input and output spaces. Visual reprogramming (VR) is one instance for vision tasks that adds a trainable noise pattern (i.e., a visual prompt) to input images to facilitate downstream classification. The existing VR approaches for CLIP train a single visual prompt using all descriptions of different downstream classes. However, the limited learning capacity may result in (1) a failure to capture diverse aspects of the descriptions (e.g., shape, color, and texture), and (2) a possible bias toward less informative attributes that do not help distinguish between classes. In this paper, we introduce a decoupling-and-reweighting framework. Our decoupled visual prompts (DVP) are optimized using descriptions grouped by explicit causes (DVP-cse) or unsupervised clusters (DVP-cls). Then, we integrate the outputs of these visual prompts with a probabilistic reweighting matrix (PRM) that measures their contributions to each downstream class. Theoretically, DVP lowers the empirical risk bound. Experimentally, DVP outperforms baselines on average across 11 downstream datasets. Notably, the DVP-PRM integration enables insights into how individual visual prompts influence classification decisions, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding reprogramming. Our code is available at https://github.com/tmlr-group/DecoupledVP.</p></details> |  |
| **[MFCLIP: Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Generalizable Diffusion Face Forgery Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09724v3)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of photo-realistic face generation methods has raised significant concerns in society and academia, highlighting the urgent need for robust and generalizable face forgery detection (FFD) techniques. Although existing approaches mainly capture face forgery patterns using image modality, other modalities like fine-grained noises and texts are not fully explored, which limits the generalization capability of the model. In addition, most FFD methods tend to identify facial images generated by GAN, but struggle to detect unseen diffusion-synthesized ones. To address the limitations, we aim to leverage the cutting-edge foundation model, contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP), to achieve generalizable diffusion face forgery detection (DFFD). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-modal fine-grained CLIP (MFCLIP) model, which mines comprehensive and fine-grained forgery traces across image-noise modalities via language-guided face forgery representation learning, to facilitate the advancement of DFFD. Specifically, we devise a fine-grained language encoder (FLE) that extracts fine global language features from hierarchical text prompts. We design a multi-modal vision encoder (MVE) to capture global image forgery embeddings as well as fine-grained noise forgery patterns extracted from the richest patch, and integrate them to mine general visual forgery traces. Moreover, we build an innovative plug-and-play sample pair attention (SPA) method to emphasize relevant negative pairs and suppress irrelevant ones, allowing cross-modality sample pairs to conduct more flexible alignment. Extensive experiments and visualizations show that our model outperforms the state of the arts on different settings like cross-generator, cross-forgery, and cross-dataset evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging CLIP Encoder for Multimodal Emotion Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00903v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal emotion recognition (MER) aims to identify human emotions by combining data from various modalities such as language, audio, and vision. Despite the recent advances of MER approaches, the limitations in obtaining extensive datasets impede the improvement of performance. To mitigate this issue, we leverage a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP)-based architecture and its semantic knowledge from massive datasets that aims to enhance the discriminative multimodal representation. We propose a label encoder-guided MER framework based on CLIP (MER-CLIP) to learn emotion-related representations across modalities. Our approach introduces a label encoder that treats labels as text embeddings to incorporate their semantic information, leading to the learning of more representative emotional features. To further exploit label semantics, we devise a cross-modal decoder that aligns each modality to a shared embedding space by sequentially fusing modality features based on emotion-related input from the label encoder. Finally, the label encoder-guided prediction enables generalization across diverse labels by embedding their semantic information as well as word labels. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art MER methods on the benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/CVF WACV 2025, pp.6115-6124, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Using Knowledge Graphs to harvest datasets for efficient CLIP model training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02746v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown significant promise for improving medical image analysis by integrating information from complementary data sources. This is widely employed for training vision-language models (VLMs) for cancer detection based on histology images and text reports. However, one of the main limitations in training these VLMs is the requirement for large paired datasets, raising concerns over privacy, and data collection, annotation, and maintenance costs. To address this challenge, we introduce CLIP-IT method to train a vision backbone model to classify histology images by pairing them with privileged textual information from an external source. At first, the modality pairing step relies on a CLIP-based model to match histology images with semantically relevant textual report data from external sources, creating an augmented multimodal dataset without the need for manually paired samples. Then, we propose a multimodal training procedure that distills the knowledge from the paired text modality to the unimodal image classifier for enhanced performance without the need for the textual data during inference. A parameter-efficient fine-tuning method is used to efficiently address the misalignment between the main (image) and paired (text) modalities. During inference, the improved unimodal histology classifier is used, with only minimal additional computational complexity. Our experiments on challenging PCAM, CRC, and BACH histology image datasets show that CLIP-IT can provide a cost-effective approach to leverage privileged textual information and outperform unimodal classifiers for histology.</p></details> |  |
| **[un$^2$CLIP: Improving CLIP's Visual Detail Capturing Ability via Inverting unCLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24517v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a foundation model and has been applied to various vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent works indicate that CLIP falls short in distinguishing detailed differences in images and shows suboptimal performance on dense-prediction and vision-centric multimodal tasks. Therefore, this work focuses on improving existing CLIP models, aiming to capture as many visual details in images as possible. We find that a specific type of generative models, unCLIP, provides a suitable framework for achieving our goal. Specifically, unCLIP trains an image generator conditioned on the CLIP image embedding. In other words, it inverts the CLIP image encoder. Compared to discriminative models like CLIP, generative models are better at capturing image details because they are trained to learn the data distribution of images. Additionally, the conditional input space of unCLIP aligns with CLIP's original image-text embedding space. Therefore, we propose to invert unCLIP (dubbed un$^2$CLIP) to improve the CLIP model. In this way, the improved image encoder can gain unCLIP's visual detail capturing ability while preserving its alignment with the original text encoder simultaneously. We evaluate our improved CLIP across various tasks to which CLIP has been applied, including the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark, the dense-prediction open-vocabulary segmentation task, and multimodal large language model tasks. Experiments show that un$^2$CLIP significantly improves the original CLIP and previous CLIP improvement methods. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/LiYinqi/un2CLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Compositional Awareness in CLIP with Efficient Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24424v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our models and code are available at https://clic-compositional-clip.github.io</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce \textbf{X-Transfer}, a novel attack method that exposes a universal adversarial vulnerability in CLIP. X-Transfer generates a Universal Adversarial Perturbation (UAP) capable of deceiving various CLIP encoders and downstream VLMs across different samples, tasks, and domains. We refer to this property as \textbf{super transferability}--a single perturbation achieving cross-data, cross-domain, cross-model, and cross-task adversarial transferability simultaneously. This is achieved through \textbf{surrogate scaling}, a key innovation of our approach. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed surrogate models, which are computationally intensive to scale, X-Transfer employs an efficient surrogate scaling strategy that dynamically selects a small subset of suitable surrogates from a large search space. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that X-Transfer significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art UAP methods, establishing a new benchmark for adversarial transferability across CLIP models. The code is publicly available in our \href{https://github.com/HanxunH/XTransferBench}{GitHub repository}.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00098v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[LADA: Scalable Label-Specific CLIP Adapter for Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23271v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning with vision-language models like CLIP offers a pathway toward scalable machine learning systems by leveraging its transferable representations. Existing CLIP-based methods adapt the pre-trained image encoder by adding multiple sets of learnable parameters, with each task using a partial set of parameters. This requires selecting the expected parameters for input images during inference, which is prone to error that degrades performance. To address this problem, we introduce LADA (Label-specific ADApter). Instead of partitioning parameters across tasks, LADA appends lightweight, label-specific memory units to the frozen CLIP image encoder, enabling discriminative feature generation by aggregating task-agnostic knowledge. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, LADA employs feature distillation for seen classes, preventing their features from being interfered with by new classes. Positioned after the image encoder, LADA prevents gradient flow to the frozen CLIP parameters, ensuring efficient training.

| **[Zero-Shot Pseudo Labels Generation Using SAM and CLIP for Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19846v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is a fundamental task in medical image analysis and autonomous driving and has a problem with the high cost of annotating the labels required in training. To address this problem, semantic segmentation methods based on semi-supervised learning with a small number of labeled data have been proposed. For example, one approach is to train a semantic segmentation model using images with annotated labels and pseudo labels. In this approach, the accuracy of the semantic segmentation model depends on the quality of the pseudo labels, and the quality of the pseudo labels depends on the performance of the model to be trained and the amount of data with annotated labels. In this paper, we generate pseudo labels using zero-shot annotation with the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP), improve the accuracy of the pseudo labels using the Unified Dual-Stream Perturbations Approach (UniMatch), and use them as enhanced labels to train a semantic segmentation model. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through the experiments using the public datasets: PASCAL and MS COCO.

This paper addresses two challenges in zero-reference LLIE: obtaining perceptually 'good' images using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model and maintaining computational efficiency for high-resolution images. We propose CLIP-Utilized Reinforcement learning-based Visual image Enhancement (CURVE). CURVE employs a simple image processing module which adjusts global image tone based on B\'ezier curve and estimates its processing parameters iteratively. The estimator is trained by reinforcement learning with rewards designed using CLIP text embeddings. Experiments on low-light and multi-exposure datasets demonstrate the performance of CURVE in terms of enhancement quality and processing speed compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | Accepted to ICIP2025 |
| **[Nonconvex Stochastic Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noises: Optimal Convergence without Gradient Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19529v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the study of heavy-tailed noises in first-order nonconvex stochastic optimization has gotten a lot of attention since it was recognized as a more realistic condition as suggested by many empirical observations. Specifically, the stochastic noise (the difference between the stochastic and true gradient) is considered to have only a finite $\mathfrak{p}$-th moment where $\mathfrak{p}\in\left(1,2\right]$ instead of assuming it always satisfies the classical finite variance assumption. To deal with this more challenging setting, people have proposed different algorithms and proved them to converge at an optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate for smooth objectives after $T$ iterations. Notably, all these new-designed algorithms are based on the same technique - gradient clipping. Naturally, one may want to know whether the clipping method is a necessary ingredient and the only way to guarantee convergence under heavy-tailed noises. In this work, by revisiting the existing Batched Normalized Stochastic Gradient Descent with Momentum (Batched NSGDM) algorithm, we provide the first convergence result under heavy-tailed noises but without gradient clipping. Concretely, we prove that Batched NSGDM can achieve the optimal $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{3\mathfrak{p}-2}})$ rate even under the relaxed smooth condition. More interestingly, we also establish the first $\mathcal{O}(T^{\frac{1-\mathfrak{p}}{2\mathfrak{p}}})$ convergence rate in the case where the tail index $\mathfrak{p}$ is unknown in advance, which is arguably the common scenario in practice.</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Benchmarking Adversarial Compositionality of Pre-trained Multimodal Representation via Text Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22943v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained multimodal representations (e.g., CLIP) have shown impressive capabilities, they exhibit significant compositional vulnerabilities leading to counterintuitive judgments. We introduce Multimodal Adversarial Compositionality (MAC), a benchmark that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate deceptive text samples to exploit these vulnerabilities across different modalities and evaluates them through both sample-wise attack success rate and group-wise entropy-based diversity. To improve zero-shot methods, we propose a self-training approach that leverages rejection-sampling fine-tuning with diversity-promoting filtering, which enhances both attack success rate and sample diversity. Using smaller language models like Llama-3.1-8B, our approach demonstrates superior performance in revealing compositional vulnerabilities across various multimodal representations, including images, videos, and audios.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 Main.

| **[Interpreting CLIP with Hierarchical Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20578v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are useful for detecting and steering interpretable features in neural networks, with particular potential for understanding complex multimodal representations. Given their ability to uncover interpretable features, SAEs are particularly valuable for analyzing large-scale vision-language models (e.g., CLIP and SigLIP), which are fundamental building blocks in modern systems yet remain challenging to interpret and control. However, current SAE methods are limited by optimizing both reconstruction quality and sparsity simultaneously, as they rely on either activation suppression or rigid sparsity constraints. To this end, we introduce Matryoshka SAE (MSAE), a new architecture that learns hierarchical representations at multiple granularities simultaneously, enabling a direct optimization of both metrics without compromise. MSAE establishes a new state-of-the-art Pareto frontier between reconstruction quality and sparsity for CLIP, achieving 0.99 cosine similarity and less than 0.1 fraction of variance unexplained while maintaining ~80% sparsity. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of MSAE as a tool for interpreting and controlling CLIP by extracting over 120 semantic concepts from its representation to perform concept-based similarity search and bias analysis in downstream tasks like CelebA. We make the codebase available at https://github.com/WolodjaZ/MSAE.</p></details> |  |

| **[Reinforcing Spatial Reasoning in Vision-Language Models with Interwoven Thinking and Visual Drawing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09965v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As textual reasoning with large language models (LLMs) has advanced significantly, there has been growing interest in enhancing the multimodal reasoning capabilities of large vision-language models (LVLMs). However, existing methods primarily approach multimodal reasoning in a straightforward, text-centric manner, where both reasoning and answer derivation are conducted purely through text, with the only difference being the presence of multimodal input. As a result, these methods often encounter fundamental limitations in spatial reasoning tasks that demand precise geometric understanding and continuous spatial tracking-capabilities that humans achieve through mental visualization and manipulation. To address the limitations, we propose drawing to reason in space, a novel paradigm that enables LVLMs to reason through elementary drawing operations in the visual space. By equipping models with basic drawing operations, including annotating bounding boxes and drawing auxiliary lines, we empower them to express and analyze spatial relationships through direct visual manipulation, meanwhile avoiding the performance ceiling imposed by specialized perception tools in previous tool-integrated reasoning approaches. To cultivate this capability, we develop a three-stage training framework: cold-start training with synthetic data to establish basic drawing abilities, reflective rejection sampling to enhance self-reflection behaviors, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize for target rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model, named VILASR, consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse spatial reasoning benchmarks, involving maze navigation, static spatial reasoning, video-based reasoning, and multi-view-based reasoning tasks, with an average improvement of 18.4%.</p></details> |  |

Leading this evolution are proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 and GPT-o1, which have captured widespread attention in the AI community due to their remarkable performance and versatility. Simultaneously, open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, have made great contributions to the ever-increasing popularity of LLMs due to the ease to customize and deploy the models across diverse applications. Although open-source LLMs present unprecedented opportunities for innovation and research, the commercialization of LLMs has raised concerns about transparency, reproducibility, and safety. Many open-source LLMs fail to meet fundamental transparency requirements by withholding essential components like training code and data, which may hinder further innovations on LLMs. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Moxin 7B, a fully open-source LLM developed, adhering to principles of open science, open source, open data, and open access. We release the pre-training code and configurations, training and fine-tuning datasets, and intermediate and final checkpoints, aiming to make continuous commitments to fully open-source LLMs. After pre-training the base model, we finetune the Moxin Base model with SOTA post-training framework and instruction data to obtain Moxin Instruct model. To improve the reasoning capability, we further finetune our Instruct model with chain-of-thought data distilled from DeepSeek R1, and then use Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) following DeepSeek R1 to finetune our model, leading to the Moxin Reasoning model. Moreover, we develop our vision language model based on our Moxin model. Experiments show that our models achieve superior performance in various evaluations such as zero-shot evaluation, few-shot evaluation, and CoT evaluation.</p></details> |  |

However, best practices for RL in instruction following remain underexplored. In this work, we explore the verification challenge in RL for instruction following and propose VerIF, a verification method that combines rule-based code verification with LLM-based verification from a large reasoning model (e.g., QwQ-32B). To support this approach, we construct a high-quality instruction-following dataset, VerInstruct, containing approximately 22,000 instances with associated verification signals. We apply RL training with VerIF to two models, achieving significant improvements across several representative instruction-following benchmarks. The trained models reach state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size and generalize well to unseen constraints. We further observe that their general capabilities remain unaffected, suggesting that RL with VerIF can be integrated into existing RL recipes to enhance overall model performance. We have released our datasets, codes, and models to facilitate future research at https://github.com/THU-KEG/VerIF.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[The Sample Complexity of Online Strategic Decision Making with Information Asymmetry and Knowledge Transportability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09940v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information asymmetry is a pervasive feature of multi-agent systems, especially evident in economics and social sciences. In these settings, agents tailor their actions based on private information to maximize their rewards. These strategic behaviors often introduce complexities due to confounding variables. Simultaneously, knowledge transportability poses another significant challenge, arising from the difficulties of conducting experiments in target environments. It requires transferring knowledge from environments where empirical data is more readily available. Against these backdrops, this paper explores a fundamental question in online learning: Can we employ non-i.i.d. actions to learn about confounders even when requiring knowledge transfer? We present a sample-efficient algorithm designed to accurately identify system dynamics under information asymmetry and to navigate the challenges of knowledge transfer effectively in reinforcement learning, framed within an online strategic interaction model. Our method provably achieves learning of an $\epsilon$-optimal policy with a tight sample complexity of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **["What are my options?": Explaining RL Agents with Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (Extended)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09901v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we provide an extended discussion of a new approach to explainable Reinforcement Learning called Diverse Near-Optimal Alternatives (DNA), first proposed at L4DC 2025. DNA seeks a set of reasonable "options" for trajectory-planning agents, optimizing policies to produce qualitatively diverse trajectories in Euclidean space. In the spirit of explainability, these distinct policies are used to "explain" an agent's options in terms of available trajectory shapes from which a human user may choose. In particular, DNA applies to value function-based policies on Markov decision processes where agents are limited to continuous trajectories. Here, we describe DNA, which uses reward shaping in local, modified Q-learning problems to solve for distinct policies with guaranteed epsilon-optimality. We show that it successfully returns qualitatively different policies that constitute meaningfully different "options" in simulation, including a brief comparison to related approaches in the stochastic optimization field of Quality Diversity. Beyond the explanatory motivation, this work opens new possibilities for exploration and adaptive planning in RL.</p></details> |  |

Our approach leverages a graph neural network trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to efficiently estimate the robot's cost-to-go, formulated as local goal recommendations. A spatio-temporal path-searching module, which accounts for kinematic constraints, is then employed to generate a reference trajectory to facilitate solving the non-convex optimization problem used for explicit constraint enforcement. More importantly, we introduce an incremental action-masking mechanism and a privileged learning strategy, enabling end-to-end training of the proposed planner. Both simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively addresses local planning in complex dynamic environments, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Compared with existing learning-optimization hybrid methods, our approach eliminates the dependency on high-fidelity simulation environments, offering significant advantages in computational efficiency and training scalability. The code will be released as open-source upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Population-Based Reinforcement Learning across Robotic Tasks with GPU-Accelerated Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03336v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep reinforcement learning (RL) has shown its effectiveness in solving complex continuous control tasks. However, this comes at the cost of an enormous amount of experience required for training, exacerbated by the sensitivity of learning efficiency and the policy performance to hyperparameter selection, which often requires numerous trials of time-consuming experiments. This work leverages a Population-Based Reinforcement Learning (PBRL) approach and a GPU-accelerated physics simulator to enhance the exploration capabilities of RL by concurrently training multiple policies in parallel. The PBRL framework is benchmarked against three state-of-the-art RL algorithms -- PPO, SAC, and DDPG -- dynamically adjusting hyperparameters based on the performance of learning agents. The experiments are performed on four challenging tasks in Isaac Gym -- Anymal Terrain, Shadow Hand, Humanoid, Franka Nut Pick -- by analyzing the effect of population size and mutation mechanisms for hyperparameters. The results show that PBRL agents achieve superior performance, in terms of cumulative reward, compared to non-evolutionary baseline agents. Moreover, the trained agents are finally deployed in the real world for a Franka Nut Pick task. To our knowledge, this is the first sim-to-real attempt for deploying PBRL agents on real hardware. Code and videos of the learned policies are available on our project website (https://sites.google.com/view/pbrl).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at 2025 IEEE 21st International Conference on Automation Science and Engineering</p></details> |

| **[CoRT: Code-integrated Reasoning within Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09820v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models.

| **[Writing-Zero: Bridge the Gap Between Non-verifiable Tasks and Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00103v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has enabled large language models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable breakthroughs in reasoning tasks with objective ground-truth answers, such as mathematics and code generation. However, a significant gap remains for non-verifiable tasks, like creative writing and open-ended dialogue, where quality assessment is inherently subjective and lacks definitive references. Existing approaches for these domains often rely on scalar reward models trained with human preferences, which suffer from limited generalization and are prone to reward hacking, such as over-explanation and length bias. In this work, we propose a unified RLVR-based training paradigm that bridges the gap between non-verifiable tasks and verifiable rewards. We introduce a writing-principle-based pairwise Generative Reward Model (GenRM) and a novel Bootstrapped Relative Policy Optimization (BRPO) algorithm. The pairwise writing GenRM leverages self-principled critique to transform subjective assessments into reliable, verifiable rewards, while BRPO enables dynamic, reference-free pairwise comparison by leveraging a bootstrapped response as temporary reference from within group rollouts during RL training. Our approach empowers LLMs to develop robust writing capabilities without supervised fine-tuning, as demonstrated by Writing-Zero, which shows consistent improvement and strong resistance to reward hacking compared to scalar reward baselines. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive results on both in-house and open-source writing benchmarks. Our findings suggest the potential to unify rule-based, reference-based, and reference-free reward modeling under the RLVR framework, thus paving the way for a comprehensive and scalable RL training paradigm applicable across all language tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Treatment Planning using Reinforcement Learning for High-dose-rate Prostate Brachytherapy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09805v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: In high-dose-rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy procedures, the pattern of needle placement solely relies on physician experience. We investigated the feasibility of using reinforcement learning (RL) to provide needle positions and dwell times based on patient anatomy during pre-planning stage. This approach would reduce procedure time and ensure consistent plan quality. Materials and Methods: We train a RL agent to adjust the position of one selected needle and all the dwell times on it to maximize a pre-defined reward function after observing the environment. After adjusting, the RL agent then moves on to the next needle, until all needles are adjusted. Multiple rounds are played by the agent until the maximum number of rounds is reached. Plan data from 11 prostate HDR boost patients (1 for training, and 10 for testing) treated in our clinic were included in this study. The dosimetric metrics and the number of used needles of RL plan were compared to those of the clinical results (ground truth). Results: On average, RL plans and clinical plans have very similar prostate coverage (Prostate V100) and Rectum D2cc (no statistical significance), while RL plans have less prostate hotspot (Prostate V150) and Urethra D20% plans with statistical significance. Moreover, RL plans use 2 less needles than clinical plan on average. Conclusion: We present the first study demonstrating the feasibility of using reinforcement learning to autonomously generate clinically practical HDR prostate brachytherapy plans. This RL-based method achieved equal or improved plan quality compared to conventional clinical approaches while requiring fewer needles. With minimal data requirements and strong generalizability, this approach has substantial potential to standardize brachytherapy planning, reduce clinical variability, and enhance patient outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforced Refinement with Self-Aware Expansion for End-to-End Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09800v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end autonomous driving has emerged as a promising paradigm for directly mapping sensor inputs to planning maneuvers using learning-based modular integrations. However, existing imitation learning (IL)-based models suffer from generalization to hard cases, and a lack of corrective feedback loop under post-deployment. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a potential solution to tackle hard cases with optimality, it is often hindered by overfitting to specific driving cases, resulting in catastrophic forgetting of generalizable knowledge and sample inefficiency. To overcome these challenges, we propose Reinforced Refinement with Self-aware Expansion (R2SE), a novel learning pipeline that constantly refines hard domain while keeping generalizable driving policy for model-agnostic end-to-end driving systems. Through reinforcement fine-tuning and policy expansion that facilitates continuous improvement, R2SE features three key components: 1) Generalist Pretraining with hard-case allocation trains a generalist imitation learning (IL) driving system while dynamically identifying failure-prone cases for targeted refinement; 2) Residual Reinforced Specialist Fine-tuning optimizes residual corrections using reinforcement learning (RL) to improve performance in hard case domain while preserving global driving knowledge; 3) Self-aware Adapter Expansion dynamically integrates specialist policies back into the generalist model, enhancing continuous performance improvement. Experimental results in closed-loop simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate improvements in generalization, safety, and long-horizon policy robustness over state-of-the-art E2E systems, highlighting the effectiveness of reinforce refinement for scalable autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

To achieve higher communication rate, the joint design of UAV trajectory and resource allocation is crucial. In this paper, a multi-antenna UAV is dispatched to simultaneously collect data from multiple ground IoT nodes (GNs) within a time interval. To improve the sum data collection (SDC) volume from the GNs, the UAV trajectory, the UAV receive beamforming, the scheduling of the GNs, and the transmit power of the GNs are jointly optimized. Since the problem is non-convex and the variables are highly coupled, it is hard to be solved using traditional methods. To find a near-optimal solution, a double-loop structured optimization-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, called rainbow learning based algorithm (RLA), and a fully DRL-based algorithm are proposed to solve the problem effectively. Specifically, the outer-loop of the RLA utilizes a fusion deep Q-network to optimize the UAV trajectory, GN scheduling, and power allocation, while the inner-loop optimizes receive beamforming by successive convex approximation. Simulation results verify that the proposed algorithms outperform two benchmarks with significant improvement in SDC volumes, energy efficiency, and fairness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures, this work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, crafting effective workflows requires great expertise to orchestrate numerous specialized components, presenting a steep learning curve for users. To address this challenge, we introduce ComfyUI-R1, the first large reasoning model for automated workflow generation. Starting with our curated dataset of 4K workflows, we construct long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning data, including node selection, workflow planning, and code-level workflow representation. ComfyUI-R1 is trained through a two-stage framework: (1) CoT fine-tuning for cold start, adapting models to the ComfyUI domain; (2) reinforcement learning for incentivizing reasoning capability, guided by a fine-grained rule-metric hybrid reward, ensuring format validity, structural integrity, and node-level fidelity. Experiments show that our 7B-parameter model achieves a 97\% format validity rate, along with high pass rate, node-level and graph-level F1 scores, significantly surpassing prior state-of-the-art methods that employ leading closed-source models such as GPT-4o and Claude series. Further analysis highlights the critical role of the reasoning process and the advantage of transforming workflows into code. Qualitative comparison reveals our strength in synthesizing intricate workflows with diverse nodes, underscoring the potential of long CoT reasoning in AI art creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

While advances have been made in natural language processing, real-world humor often thrives in a multi-modal context, encapsulated distinctively by memes. This paper poses a particular emphasis on the impact of multi-images on meme captioning. After that, we introduce the \textsc{XMeCap} framework, a novel approach that adopts supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning based on an innovative reward model, which factors in both global and local similarities between visuals and text. Our results, benchmarked against contemporary models, manifest a marked improvement in caption generation for both single-image and multi-image memes, as well as different meme categories. \textsc{XMeCap} achieves an average evaluation score of 75.85 for single-image memes and 66.32 for multi-image memes, outperforming the best baseline by 6.75\% and 8.56\%, respectively.

Yet, their high costs, proprietary nature, and complex architectures - uniquely combining reinforcement learning (RL), search heuristics, and LLMs - present accessibility and scalability challenges. To address these, we propose a comprehensive blueprint that organizes RLM components into a modular framework, based on a survey and analysis of all RLM works. This blueprint incorporates diverse reasoning structures (chains, trees, graphs, and nested forms), reasoning strategies (e.g., Monte Carlo Tree Search, Beam Search), RL concepts (policy, value models and others), supervision schemes (Outcome-Based and Process-Based Supervision), and other related concepts (e.g., Test-Time Compute, Retrieval-Augmented Generation, agent tools). We also provide detailed mathematical formulations and algorithmic specifications to simplify RLM implementation. By showing how schemes like LLaMA-Berry, QwQ, Journey Learning, and Graph of Thoughts fit as special cases, we demonstrate the blueprint's versatility and unifying potential. To illustrate its utility, we introduce x1, a modular implementation for rapid RLM prototyping and experimentation. Using x1 and a literature review, we provide key insights, such as multi-phase training for policy and value models, and the importance of familiar training distributions. Finally, we discuss scalable RLM cloud deployments and we outline how RLMs can integrate with a broader LLM ecosystem. Our work demystifies RLM construction, democratizes advanced reasoning capabilities, and fosters innovation, aiming to mitigate the gap between "rich AI" and "poor AI" by lowering barriers to RLM design and experimentation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional reward modeling methods, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) reward model, fall short in expressiveness, particularly in addressing intransitive preferences. In this paper, we introduce preference embedding, an approach that embeds responses into a latent space to capture intricate preference structures efficiently, achieving linear query complexity. Additionally, we propose preference score-based General Preference Optimization (GPO), which generalizes reward-based reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Experimental results show that our General Preference embedding Model (GPM) consistently outperforms the BT reward model on the RewardBench benchmark and effectively models cyclic preferences where any BT reward model behaves like a random guess. Furthermore, evaluations on downstream tasks such as AlpacaEval2.0, following the language model post-training with GPO and our general preference model, reveal performance improvements over BT models. These findings indicate that our method may enhance the alignment of foundation models with nuanced human values. The code is available at https://github.com/general-preference/general-preference-model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |

We introduce a novel continuous-time Bellman error, derived from the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which quantifies the suboptimality of stabilizing policies and is parametrized in terms of the feedback gain. We analyze its properties, including its effective domain, smoothness, coerciveness and show the existence of a unique stationary point within the stability region. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form gradient expression of the Bellman error that induces a gradient flow. This converges to the optimal feedback and generates a unique trajectory which exclusively comprises stabilizing feedback policies. Additionally, this work advances interesting connections between LQR theory and Reinforcement Learning (RL) by redefining suboptimality of the Algebraic Riccati Equation (ARE) as a Bellman error, adapting a state-independent formulation, and leveraging Lyapunov equations to overcome the infinite-horizon challenge. We validate our method in a simulation and compare it to the state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to Conference on Decision and Control</p></details> |

The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level controllers, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

| **[Intent Factored Generation: Unleashing the Diversity in Your Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09659v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obtaining multiple meaningfully diverse, high quality samples from Large Language Models for a fixed prompt remains an open challenge. Current methods for increasing diversity often only operate at the token-level, paraphrasing the same response. This is problematic because it leads to poor exploration on reasoning problems and to unengaging, repetitive conversational agents. To address this we propose Intent Factored Generation (IFG), factorising the sampling process into two stages. First, we sample a semantically dense intent, e.g., a summary or keywords. Second, we sample the final response conditioning on both the original prompt and the intent from the first stage. This allows us to use a higher temperature during the intent step to promote conceptual diversity, and a lower temperature during the final generation to ensure the outputs are coherent and self-consistent. Additionally, we find that prompting the model to explicitly state its intent for each step of the chain-of-thought before generating the step is beneficial for reasoning tasks. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness across a diverse set of tasks. We show this method improves both pass@k and Reinforcement Learning from Verifier Feedback on maths and code tasks. For instruction-tuning, we combine IFG with Direct Preference Optimisation to increase conversational diversity without sacrificing reward. Finally, we achieve higher diversity while maintaining the quality of generations on a general language modelling task, using a new dataset of reader comments and news articles that we collect and open-source. In summary, we present a simple method of increasing the sample diversity of LLMs while maintaining performance. This method can be implemented by changing the prompt and varying the temperature during generation, making it easy to integrate into many algorithms for gains across various applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attention-Based Map Encoding for Learning Generalized Legged Locomotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09588v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic locomotion of legged robots is a critical yet challenging topic in expanding the operational range of mobile robots. It requires precise planning when possible footholds are sparse, robustness against uncertainties and disturbances, and generalizability across diverse terrains. While traditional model-based controllers excel at planning on complex terrains, they struggle with real-world uncertainties. Learning-based controllers offer robustness to such uncertainties but often lack precision on terrains with sparse steppable areas. Hybrid methods achieve enhanced robustness on sparse terrains by combining both methods but are computationally demanding and constrained by the inherent limitations of model-based planners. To achieve generalized legged locomotion on diverse terrains while preserving the robustness of learning-based controllers, this paper proposes to learn an attention-based map encoding conditioned on robot proprioception, which is trained as part of the end-to-end controller using reinforcement learning. We show that the network learns to focus on steppable areas for future footholds when the robot dynamically navigates diverse and challenging terrains. We synthesize behaviors that exhibit robustness against uncertainties while enabling precise and agile traversal of sparse terrains. Additionally, our method offers a way to interpret the topographical perception of a neural network. We have trained two controllers for a 12-DoF quadrupedal robot and a 23-DoF humanoid robot respectively and tested the resulting controllers in the real world under various challenging indoor and outdoor scenarios, including ones unseen during training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Original draft prior to peer review.

| **[MOORL: A Framework for Integrating Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09574v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sample efficiency and exploration remain critical challenges in Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), particularly in complex domains. Offline RL, which enables agents to learn optimal policies from static, pre-collected datasets, has emerged as a promising alternative. However, offline RL is constrained by issues such as out-of-distribution (OOD) actions that limit policy performance and generalization. To overcome these limitations, we propose Meta Offline-Online Reinforcement Learning (MOORL), a hybrid framework that unifies offline and online RL for efficient and scalable learning. While previous hybrid methods rely on extensive design components and added computational complexity to utilize offline data effectively, MOORL introduces a meta-policy that seamlessly adapts across offline and online trajectories. This enables the agent to leverage offline data for robust initialization while utilizing online interactions to drive efficient exploration. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach enhances exploration by effectively combining the complementary strengths of offline and online data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MOORL learns a stable Q-function without added complexity. Extensive experiments on 28 tasks from the D4RL and V-D4RL benchmarks validate its effectiveness, showing consistent improvements over state-of-the-art offline and hybrid RL baselines. With minimal computational overhead, MOORL achieves strong performance, underscoring its potential for practical applications in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[TooBadRL: Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor Attacks on Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09562v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable success in a wide range of sequential decision-making domains, including robotics, healthcare, smart grids, and finance. Recent research demonstrates that attackers can efficiently exploit system vulnerabilities during the training phase to execute backdoor attacks, producing malicious actions when specific trigger patterns are present in the state observations. However, most existing backdoor attacks rely primarily on simplistic and heuristic trigger configurations, overlooking the potential efficacy of trigger optimization. To address this gap, we introduce TooBadRL (Trigger Optimization to Boost Effectiveness of Backdoor Attacks on DRL), the first framework to systematically optimize DRL backdoor triggers along three critical axes, i.e., temporal, spatial, and magnitude. Specifically, we first introduce a performance-aware adaptive freezing mechanism for injection timing. Then, we formulate dimension selection as a cooperative game, utilizing Shapley value analysis to identify the most influential state variable for the injection dimension. Furthermore, we propose a gradient-based adversarial procedure to optimize the injection magnitude under environment constraints. Evaluations on three mainstream DRL algorithms and nine benchmark tasks show that TooBadRL significantly improves attack success rates, while ensuring minimal degradation of normal task performance. These results highlight the previously underappreciated importance of principled trigger optimization in DRL backdoor attacks. The source code of TooBadRL can be found at https://github.com/S3IC-Lab/TooBadRL.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness in medical applications remains limited due to the inherent discrepancies between data and tasks in medical scenarios and those in the general domain. Concretely, existing medical MLLMs face the following critical limitations: (1) limited coverage of medical knowledge beyond imaging, (2) heightened susceptibility to hallucinations due to suboptimal data curation processes, (3) lack of reasoning capabilities tailored for complex medical scenarios. To address these challenges, we first propose a comprehensive data curation procedure that (1) efficiently acquires rich medical knowledge data not only from medical imaging but also from extensive medical texts and general-domain data; and (2) synthesizes accurate medical captions, visual question answering (VQA), and reasoning samples. As a result, we build a multimodal dataset enriched with extensive medical knowledge. Building on the curated data, we introduce our medical-specialized MLLM: Lingshu. Lingshu undergoes multi-stage training to embed medical expertise and enhance its task-solving capabilities progressively. Besides, we preliminarily explore the potential of applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards paradigm to enhance Lingshu's medical reasoning ability. Additionally, we develop MedEvalKit, a unified evaluation framework that consolidates leading multimodal and textual medical benchmarks for standardized, fair, and efficient model assessment. We evaluate the performance of Lingshu on three fundamental medical tasks, multimodal QA, text-based QA, and medical report generation. The results show that Lingshu consistently outperforms the existing open-source multimodal models on most tasks ...</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical Report, 53 pages, 25 tables, and 16 figures</p></details> |

Many real-world problems require non-Markovian policies to handle complex structured tasks with logical conditions, often leading to prohibitively large state representations; this requires efficient methods for breaking these problems down and reusing structure between tasks. To this end, we introduce a compositional framework called Linearly-Solvable Goal Kernel Dynamic Programming (LS-GKDP) to address the complexity of solving non-Markovian Boolean sub-goal tasks with ordering constraints. LS-GKDP combines the Linearly-Solvable Markov Decision Process (LMDP) formalism with the Options Framework of Reinforcement Learning. LMDPs can be efficiently solved as a principal eigenvector problem, and options are policies with termination conditions used as temporally extended actions; with LS-GKDP we expand LMDPs to control over options for logical tasks. This involves decomposing a high-dimensional problem down into a set of goal-condition options for each goal and constructing a goal kernel, which is an abstract transition kernel that jumps from an option's initial-states to its termination-states along with an update of the higher-level task-state. We show how an LMDP with a goal kernel enables the efficient optimization of meta-policies in a lower-dimensional subspace defined by the task grounding. Options can also be remapped to new problems within a super-exponential space of tasks without significant recomputation, and we identify cases where the solution is invariant to the task grounding, permitting zero-shot task transfer.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 Pa...</summary><p>52 Pages total.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have emerged as key enablers in optimizing V2X communication by enhancing network management, predictive analytics, security, and cooperative driving due to their outstanding performance across various domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. This survey comprehensively reviews recent advances in AI and ML models applied to 6G-V2X communication. It focuses on state-of-the-art techniques, including Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Generative Learning (GL), and Federated Learning (FL), with particular emphasis on developments from the past two years. Notably, AI, especially GL, has shown remarkable progress and emerging potential in enhancing the performance, adaptability, and intelligence of 6G-V2X systems. Despite these advances, a systematic summary of recent research efforts in this area remains lacking, which this survey aims to address. We analyze their roles in 6G-V2X applications, such as intelligent resource allocation, beamforming, intelligent traffic management, and security management. Furthermore, we explore the technical challenges, including computational complexity, data privacy, and real-time decision-making constraints, while identifying future research directions for AI-driven 6G-V2X development.

A central challenge in this setting is to design algorithms that select informative preference queries to identify the underlying reward while ensuring theoretical guarantees. We propose a meta-algorithm based on randomized exploration, which avoids the computational challenges associated with optimistic approaches and remains tractable. We establish both regret and last-iterate guarantees under mild reinforcement learning oracle assumptions. To improve query complexity, we introduce and analyze an improved algorithm that collects batches of trajectory pairs and applies optimal experimental design to select informative comparison queries. The batch structure also enables parallelization of preference queries, which is relevant in practical deployment as feedback can be gathered concurrently. Empirical evaluation confirms that the proposed method is competitive with reward-based reinforcement learning while requiring a small number of preference queries.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.</p></details> |  |

Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is appealing as it can deal with privacy concerns and access constraints on source-domain data during adaptation to target-domain data. However, SFDA faces challenges such as insufficient supervision in the target domain with unlabeled images. In this work, we propose a Segment Anything Model (SAM)-guided Reliable Pseudo-Labels method for SFDA (SRPL-SFDA) with three key components: 1) Test-Time Tri-branch Intensity Enhancement (T3IE) that not only improves quality of raw pseudo-labels in the target domain, but also leads to SAM-compatible inputs with three channels to better leverage SAM's zero-shot inference ability for refining the pseudo-labels; 2) A reliable pseudo-label selection module that rejects low-quality pseudo-labels based on Consistency of Multiple SAM Outputs (CMSO) under input perturbations with T3IE; and 3) A reliability-aware training procedure in the unlabeled target domain where reliable pseudo-labels are used for supervision and unreliable parts are regularized by entropy minimization. Experiments conducted on two multi-domain medical image segmentation datasets for fetal brain and the prostate respectively demonstrate that: 1) SRPL-SFDA effectively enhances pseudo-label quality in the unlabeled target domain, and improves SFDA performance by leveraging the reliability-aware training; 2) SRPL-SFDA outperformed state-of-the-art SFDA methods, and its performance is close to that of supervised training in the target domain. The code of this work is available online: https://github.com/HiLab-git/SRPL-SFDA.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures.

Traditional approaches, such as edge detection and variational methods, have been widely explored, while recent advances in deep learning have shown promising results but often require extensive training data. In this work, we propose a novel variational framework for 2D image segmentation that integrates concepts from shape analysis and diffeomorphic transformations. Our method models segmentation as the deformation of a template curve via a diffeomorphic transformation of the image domain, using the Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM) framework. The curve evolution is guided by a loss function that compares the deformed curve to the image gradient field, formulated through the varifold representation of geometric shapes. The approach is implemented in Python with GPU acceleration using the PyKeops library. This framework allows for accurate segmentation with a flexible and theoretically grounded methodology that does not rely on large datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSS: Semi-Supervised SAM-2 with Efficient Prompting for Medical Imaging Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08949v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of information explosion, efficiently leveraging large-scale unlabeled data while minimizing the reliance on high-quality pixel-level annotations remains a critical challenge in the field of medical imaging. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) enhances the utilization of unlabeled data by facilitating knowledge transfer, significantly improving the performance of fully supervised models and emerging as a highly promising research direction in medical image analysis. Inspired by the ability of Vision Foundation Models (e.g., SAM-2) to provide rich prior knowledge, we propose SSS (Semi-Supervised SAM-2), a novel approach that leverages SAM-2's robust feature extraction capabilities to uncover latent knowledge in unlabeled medical images, thus effectively enhancing feature support for fully supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, building upon the single-stream "weak-to-strong" consistency regularization framework, this paper introduces a Discriminative Feature Enhancement (DFE) mechanism to further explore the feature discrepancies introduced by various data augmentation strategies across multiple views. By leveraging feature similarity and dissimilarity across multi-scale augmentation techniques, the method reconstructs and models the features, thereby effectively optimizing the salient regions. Furthermore, a prompt generator is developed that integrates Physical Constraints with a Sliding Window (PCSW) mechanism to generate input prompts for unlabeled data, fulfilling SAM-2's requirement for additional prompts. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method for semi-supervised medical image segmentation on two multi-label datasets, i.e., ACDC and BHSD. Notably, SSS achieves an average Dice score of 53.15 on BHSD, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method by +3.65 Dice.

We evaluate the performance of using gaze-based prompts with SAM-2 and MedSAM-2 using both synthetic and real gaze data.

Rodents are the most widely studied animal subjects for such research because of their economic advantage and hardiness. Recently, video based eye trackers that use image processing techniques have become a popular option for gaze tracking because they are easy to use and are completely noninvasive. Although significant progress has been made in improving the accuracy and robustness of eye tracking algorithms, unfortunately, almost all of the techniques have focused on human eyes, which does not account for the unique characteristics of the rodent eye images, e.g., variability in eye parameters, abundance of surrounding hair, and their small size. To overcome these unique challenges, this work presents a flexible, robust, and highly accurate model for pupil and corneal reflection identification in rodent gaze determination that can be incrementally trained to account for variability in eye parameters encountered in the field. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper that demonstrates a highly accurate and practical biomedical image segmentation based convolutional neural network architecture for pupil and corneal reflection identification in eye images. This new method, in conjunction with our automated infrared videobased eye recording system, offers the state of the art technology in eye tracking for neuroscience and vision science research for rodents.</p></details> |  |

This study proposes an automatic segmentation model for building facade walls and windows based on multimodal semantic guidance, called Segment Any Architectural Facades (SAAF). First, SAAF has a multimodal semantic collaborative feature extraction mechanism. By combining natural language processing technology, it can fuse the semantic information in text descriptions with image features, enhancing the semantic understanding of building facade components. Second, we developed an end-to-end training framework that enables the model to autonomously learn the mapping relationship from text descriptions to image segmentation, reducing the influence of manual intervention on the segmentation results and improving the automation and robustness of the model. Finally, we conducted extensive experiments on multiple facade datasets. The segmentation results of SAAF outperformed existing methods in the mIoU metric, indicating that the SAAF model can maintain high-precision segmentation ability when faced with diverse datasets. Our model has made certain progress in improving the accuracy and generalization ability of the wall and window segmentation task. It is expected to provide a reference for the development of architectural computer vision technology and also explore new ideas and technical paths for the application of multimodal learning in the architectural field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text-guided multi-stage cross-perception network for medical image segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07475v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in clinical medicine, serving as a tool for auxiliary diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring, thus facilitating physicians in the study and treatment of diseases. However, existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19, MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[FAMSeg: Fetal Femur and Cranial Ultrasound Segmentation Using Feature-Aware Attention and Mamba Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07431v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate ultrasound image segmentation is a prerequisite for precise biometrics and accurate assessment. Relying on manual delineation introduces significant errors and is time-consuming. However, existing segmentation models are designed based on objects in natural scenes, making them difficult to adapt to ultrasound objects with high noise and high similarity. This is particularly evident in small object segmentation, where a pronounced jagged effect occurs. Therefore, this paper proposes a fetal femur and cranial ultrasound image segmentation model based on feature perception and Mamba enhancement to address these challenges. Specifically, a longitudinal and transverse independent viewpoint scanning convolution block and a feature perception module were designed to enhance the ability to capture local detail information and improve the fusion of contextual information. Combined with the Mamba-optimized residual structure, this design suppresses the interference of raw noise and enhances local multi-dimensional scanning. The system builds global information and local feature dependencies, and is trained with a combination of different optimizers to achieve the optimal solution. After extensive experimental validation, the FAMSeg network achieved the fastest loss reduction and the best segmentation performance across images of varying sizes and orientations.</p></details> |  |

Despite achieving impressive results in delineating primary target areas, most current methodologies struggle to precisely capture the subtle details of boundaries. This deficiency often leads to significant diagnostic inaccuracies. To tackle this issue, we introduce C3S3, a novel semi-supervised segmentation model that synergistically integrates complementary competition and contrastive selection. This design significantly sharpens boundary delineation and enhances overall precision. Specifically, we develop an $\textit{Outcome-Driven Contrastive Learning}$ module dedicated to refining boundary localization. Additionally, we incorporate a $\textit{Dynamic Complementary Competition}$ module that leverages two high-performing sub-networks to generate pseudo-labels, thereby further improving segmentation quality. The proposed C3S3 undergoes rigorous validation on two publicly accessible datasets, encompassing the practices of both MRI and CT scans. The results demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance compared to previous cutting-edge competitors.

Despite advancements in artificial intelligence enabling automated sleep staging, significant challenges remain: (1) Simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features from multi-channel raw signals, including characteristic sleep waveforms and salient spatial brain networks. (2) Capturing the spatial-temporal coupling patterns essential for accurate sleep staging. To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework named ST-USleepNet, comprising a spatial-temporal graph construction module (ST) and a U-shaped sleep network (USleepNet). The ST module converts raw signals into a spatial-temporal graph based on signal similarity, temporal, and spatial relationships to model spatial-temporal coupling patterns. The USleepNet employs a U-shaped structure for both the temporal and spatial streams, mirroring its original use in image segmentation to isolate significant targets. Applied to raw sleep signals and graph data from the ST module, USleepNet effectively segments these inputs, simultaneously extracting prominent temporal and spatial sleep features. Testing on three datasets demonstrates that ST-USleepNet outperforms existing baselines, and model visualizations confirm its efficacy in extracting prominent sleep features and temporal-spatial coupling patterns across various sleep stages.

In this paper, we firstly propose several hyperbolic mean curvature flow-driven ACMs (HMCF-ACMs), which introduce tunable initial velocity fields, enabling adaptive optimization for diverse segmentation scenarios. We shall prove that HMCF-ACMs are indeed normal flows and establish the numerical equivalence between dissipative HMCF formulations and certain wave equations using the level set method with signed distance function. Building on this framework, we furthermore develop hyperbolic dual-mode regularized flow-driven ACMs (HDRF-ACMs), which utilize smooth Heaviside functions for edge-aware force modulation to suppress over-diffusion near weak boundaries. Then, we optimize a weighted fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm with nine-point stencil spatial discretization when solving the above-mentioned wave equations. Experiments show that both HMCF-ACMs and HDRF-ACMs could achieve more precise segmentations with superior noise resistance and numerical stability due to task-adaptive configurations of initial velocities and initial contours.</p></details> |  |

When using U-Net-style architectures, it is common practice to address this problem by pretraining the encoder part on a large general-purpose dataset like ImageNet. However, these methods are resource-intensive and do not guarantee improved performance on the downstream task. In this paper we investigate a variety of training setups on medical image segmentation datasets, using ImageNet-pretrained models. By examining over 300 combinations of models, datasets, and training methods, we find that shorter pretraining often leads to better results on the downstream task, providing additional proof to the well-known fact that the accuracy of the model on ImageNet is a poor indicator for downstream performance. As our main contribution, we introduce a novel transferability metric, based on contrastive learning, that measures how robustly a pretrained model is able to represent the target data. In contrast to other transferability scores, our method is applicable to the case of transferring from ImageNet classification to medical image segmentation. We apply our robustness score by measuring it throughout the pretraining phase to indicate when the model weights are optimal for downstream transfer. This reduces pretraining time and improves results on the target task.</p></details> | <details><summary>An er...</summary><p>An error was discovered in the aggregation process of our results, particularly affecting the experiments involving the advanced pretraining method.

The typical component of UNet family is the skip connection, however, their skip connections face two significant limitations: (1) they lack effective interaction between features at different scales, and (2) they rely on simple concatenation or addition operations, which constrain efficient information integration. While recent improvements to UNet have focused on enhancing encoder and decoder capabilities, these limitations remain overlooked. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel multi-scale feature fusion method that reimagines the UNet decoding process as solving an initial value problem (IVP), treating skip connections as discrete nodes. By leveraging principles from the linear multistep method, we propose an adaptive ordinary differential equation method to enable effective multi-scale feature fusion. Our approach is independent of the encoder and decoder architectures, making it adaptable to various U-Net-like networks. Experiments on ACDC, KiTS2023, MSD brain tumor, and ISIC2017/2018 skin lesion segmentation datasets demonstrate improved feature utilization, reduced network parameters, and maintained high performance.

Users can use text-based or click-based prompts to segment objects of interest without requiring labeled training datasets. Gaussian Splatting allows for the learning of the 3D representation of a scene's geometry and radiance based on 2D images. Combining Google Earth Studio, SAM2+GroundingDINO, 2D Gaussian Splatting, and our improvements in mask refinement based on morphological operations and contour simplification, we created a pipeline to extract the 3D mesh of any building based on its name, address, or geographic coordinates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Refer to Anything with Vision-Language Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05342v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image segmentation models have advanced to segment images into high-quality masks for visual entities, and yet they cannot provide comprehensive semantic understanding for complex queries based on both language and vision. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in applications that require user-friendly interactions driven by vision-language prompts. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel task of omnimodal referring expression segmentation (ORES). In this task, a model produces a group of masks based on arbitrary prompts specified by text only or text plus reference visual entities. To address this new challenge, we propose a novel framework to "Refer to Any Segmentation Mask Group" (RAS), which augments segmentation models with complex multimodal interactions and comprehension via a mask-centric large multimodal model. For training and benchmarking ORES models, we create datasets MaskGroups-2M and MaskGroups-HQ to include diverse mask groups specified by text and reference entities. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate superior performance of RAS on our new ORES task, as well as classic referring expression segmentation (RES) and generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) tasks.

| **[DM-SegNet: Dual-Mamba Architecture for 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Global Context Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05297v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D medical image segmentation demands architectures capable of reconciling global context modeling with spatial topology preservation. While State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba show potential for sequence modeling, existing medical SSMs suffer from encoder-decoder incompatibility: the encoder's 1D sequence flattening compromises spatial structures, while conventional decoders fail to leverage Mamba's state propagation. We present DM-SegNet, a Dual-Mamba architecture integrating directional state transitions with anatomy-aware hierarchical decoding. The core innovations include a quadri-directional spatial Mamba module employing four-directional 3D scanning to maintain anatomical spatial coherence, a gated spatial convolution layer that enhances spatially sensitive feature representation prior to state modeling, and a Mamba-driven decoding framework enabling bidirectional state synchronization across scales. Extensive evaluation on two clinically significant benchmarks demonstrates the efficacy of DM-SegNet: achieving state-of-the-art Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 85.44% on the Synapse dataset for abdominal organ segmentation and 90.22% on the BraTS2023 dataset for brain tumor segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Universal medical image segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) remains challenging due to its limited adaptability to medical domains. Existing adaptations, such as MedSAM, enhance SAM's performance in medical imaging but at the cost of reduced generalization to unseen data. Therefore, in this paper, we propose SAM-aware Test-Time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a fundamentally different pipeline that preserves the generalization of SAM while improving its segmentation performance in medical imaging via a test-time framework. SAM-TTA tackles two key challenges: (1) input-level discrepancies caused by differences in image acquisition between natural and medical images and (2) semantic-level discrepancies due to fundamental differences in object definition between natural and medical domains (e.g., clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). Specifically, our SAM-TTA framework comprises (1) Self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which adaptively converts single-channel medical images into three-channel SAM-compatible inputs while maintaining structural integrity, to mitigate the input gap between medical and natural images, and (2) Dual-scale Uncertainty-driven Mean Teacher adaptation (DUMT), which employs consistency learning to align SAM's internal representations to medical semantics, enabling efficient adaptation without auxiliary supervision or expensive retraining. Extensive experiments on five public datasets demonstrate that our SAM-TTA outperforms existing TTA approaches and even surpasses fully fine-tuned models such as MedSAM in certain scenarios, establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation.

However, deep learning-based segmentation models often face challenges related to convergence speed and stability, mainly due to the complex statistical distribution of this type of data. In this study, we evaluate the impact of mode normalization on two widely used semantic segmentation models, U-Net and SegNet. Specifically, we integrate mode normalization, to reduce convergence time while maintaining the performance of the baseline models. Experimental results demonstrate that mode normalization significantly accelerates convergence. Furthermore, cross-validation results indicate that normalized models exhibit increased stability in different zones. These findings highlight the effectiveness of normalization in improving computational efficiency and generalization in SAR image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

However, manual annotation is a cumbersome and effortful task. To mitigate these aspects, this study implements and evaluates the usability and clinical applicability of an extended reality (XR)-based segmentation tool for anatomical CT scans, using the Meta Quest 3 headset and Logitech MX Ink stylus. We develop an immersive interface enabling real-time interaction with 2D and 3D medical imaging data in a customizable workspace designed to mitigate workflow fragmentation and cognitive demands inherent to conventional manual segmentation tools. The platform combines stylus-driven annotation, mirroring traditional pen-on-paper workflows, with instant 3D volumetric rendering. A user study with a public craniofacial CT dataset demonstrated the tool's foundational viability, achieving a System Usability Scale (SUS) score of 66, within the expected range for medical applications. Participants highlighted the system's intuitive controls (scoring 4.1/5 for self-descriptiveness on ISONORM metrics) and spatial interaction design, with qualitative feedback highlighting strengths in hybrid 2D/3D navigation and realistic stylus ergonomics. While users identified opportunities to enhance task-specific precision and error management, the platform's core workflow enabled dynamic slice adjustment, reducing cognitive load compared to desktop tools. Results position the XR-stylus paradigm as a promising foundation for immersive segmentation tools, with iterative refinements targeting haptic feedback calibration and workflow personalization to advance adoption in preoperative planning.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this paper, we propose an {\em interactive object-aware audio generation} model that grounds sound generation in user-selected visual objects within images. Our method integrates object-centric learning into a conditional latent diffusion model, which learns to associate image regions with their corresponding sounds through multi-modal attention. At test time, our model employs image segmentation to allow users to interactively generate sounds at the {\em object} level. We theoretically validate that our attention mechanism functionally approximates test-time segmentation masks, ensuring the generated audio aligns with selected objects. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations show that our model outperforms baselines, achieving better alignment between objects and their associated sounds.

This paper presents a comprehensive study on MIS based on DNNs. Intelligent Vision Systems are often evaluated based on their output levels, such as Data, Information, Knowledge, Intelligence, and Wisdom (DIKIW),and the state-of-the-art solutions in MIS at these levels are the focus of research. Additionally, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) has become an important research direction, as it aims to uncover the "black box" nature of previous DNN architectures to meet the requirements of transparency and ethics. The study emphasizes the importance of MIS in disease diagnosis and early detection, particularly for increasing the survival rate of cancer patients through timely diagnosis. XAI and early prediction are considered two important steps in the journey from "intelligence" to "wisdom." Additionally, the paper addresses existing challenges and proposes potential solutions to enhance the efficiency of implementing DNN-based MIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Average Calibration Losses for Reliable Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03942v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident, compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows.

Existing datasets for RRSIS suffer from critical limitations in resolution, scene diversity, and category coverage, which hinders the generalization and real-world applicability of refer segmentation models. To facilitate the development of this field, we introduce NWPU-Refer, the largest and most diverse RRSIS dataset to date, comprising 15,003 high-resolution images (1024-2048px) spanning 30+ countries with 49,745 annotated targets supporting single-object, multi-object, and non-object segmentation scenarios. Additionally, we propose the Multi-scale Referring Segmentation Network (MRSNet), a novel framework tailored for the unique demands of RRSIS. MRSNet introduces two key innovations: (1) an Intra-scale Feature Interaction Module (IFIM) that captures fine-grained details within each encoder stage, and (2) a Hierarchical Feature Interaction Module (HFIM) to enable seamless cross-scale feature fusion, preserving spatial integrity while enhancing discriminative power. Extensive experiments conducte on the proposed NWPU-Refer dataset demonstrate that MRSNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness.

Current RGB tree segmentation methods rely on training specialized machine learning models with labeled tree datasets. While these learning-based approaches can outperform manual data collection when accurate, the existing models still depend on training data that's hard to scale. In this paper, we investigate the efficacy of using a state-of-the-art image segmentation model, Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), in a zero-shot manner for individual tree detection and segmentation. We evaluate a pretrained SAM2 model on two tasks in this domain: (1) zero-shot segmentation and (2) zero-shot transfer by using predictions from an existing tree detection model as prompts. Our results suggest that SAM2 not only has impressive generalization capabilities, but also can form a natural synergy with specialized methods trained on in-domain labeled data. We find that applying large pretrained models to problems in remote sensing is a promising avenue for future progress.

Existing efforts to fine-tune SAM for medical segmentation typically struggle to remove this dependency. We propose Hierarchical Self-Prompting SAM (HSP-SAM), a novel self-prompting framework that enables SAM to achieve strong performance in prompt-free medical image segmentation. Unlike previous self-prompting methods that remain limited to positional prompts similar to vanilla SAM, we are the first to introduce learning abstract prompts during the self-prompting process. This simple and intuitive self-prompting framework achieves superior performance on classic segmentation tasks such as polyp and skin lesion segmentation, while maintaining robustness across diverse medical imaging modalities. Furthermore, it exhibits strong generalization to unseen datasets, achieving improvements of up to 14.04% over previous state-of-the-art methods on some challenging benchmarks. These results suggest that abstract prompts encapsulate richer and higher-dimensional semantic information compared to positional prompts, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and generalization performance. All models and codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Therefore, we propose two main improvements. First, we introduce a novel pignistic co-evidential fusion strategy using generalized evidential deep learning, extended by traditional D-S evidence theory, to obtain a more precise uncertainty measure for each voxel in medical samples. This assists the model in learning mixed labeled information and establishing semantic associations between labeled and unlabeled data. Second, we introduce the concept of information volume of mass function (IVUM) to evaluate the constructed evidence, implementing two evidential learning schemes. One optimizes evidential deep learning by combining the information volume of the mass function with original uncertainty measures. The other integrates the learning pattern based on the co-evidential fusion strategy, using IVUM to design a new optimization objective. Experiments on four datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of our method.</p></details> |  |

This creates dual deficiencies: (1) Stranded high-level features become semantic dead-ends without gradient updates, while (2) low-level features lack essential semantic context for robust classification. We propose E-FPN-BS that systematically converts wasted high-level semantics into low-level feature enhancements. To address these issues, we propose E-FPN-BS, a novel architecture integrating multi-scale feature enhancement and adaptive optimization. First, our Context Enhancement Module(CEM) employs dual-branch processing to align and compress high-level features for effective global-local fusion. Second, the Foreground-Background Separation Module (FBSM) generates spatial gating masks that dynamically amplify discriminative regions. To address gradient imbalance across object scales, we further propose a Dynamic Gradient-Balanced Loss (DCLoss) that automatically modulates loss contributions via scale-aware gradient equilibrium. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the outstanding performance and generalization ability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue, inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection, the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2, Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by 72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only 4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3 times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.</p></details> |  |

The key challenge for image-based 3D object detection tasks is the lack of 3D geometric cues, which leads to ambiguity in establishing correspondences between images and 3D representations. To tackle this problem, 3DGeoDet generates efficient 3D geometric representations in both explicit and implicit manners based on predicted depth information. Specifically, we utilize the predicted depth to learn voxel occupancy and optimize the voxelized 3D feature volume explicitly through the proposed voxel occupancy attention. To further enhance 3D awareness, the feature volume is integrated with an implicit 3D representation, the truncated signed distance function (TSDF). Without requiring supervision from 3D signals, we significantly improve the model's comprehension of 3D geometry by leveraging intermediate 3D representations and achieve end-to-end training. Our approach surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art image-based methods on both single- and multi-view benchmark datasets across diverse environments, achieving a 9.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the SUN RGB-D dataset, a 3.3 mAP@0.5 improvement on the ScanNetV2 dataset, and a 0.19 AP3D@0.7 improvement on the KITTI dataset.

To perform this task, a new trend is to fuse multi-modal inputs, i.e., LiDAR and camera. Under such a trend, recent methods fuse these two modalities by unifying them in the same 3D space. However, during direct fusion in a unified space, the drawbacks of both modalities (LiDAR features struggle with detailed semantic information and the camera lacks accurate 3D spatial information) are also preserved, diluting semantic and spatial awareness of the final unified representation. To address the issue, this letter proposes a novel bidirectional complementary LiDAR-camera fusion framework, called BiCo-Fusion that can achieve robust semantic- and spatial-aware 3D object detection. The key insight is to fuse LiDAR and camera features in a bidirectional complementary way to enhance the semantic awareness of the LiDAR and the 3D spatial awareness of the camera. The enhanced features from both modalities are then adaptively fused to build a semantic- and spatial-aware unified representation. Specifically, we introduce Pre-Fusion consisting of a Voxel Enhancement Module (VEM) to enhance the semantic awareness of voxel features from 2D camera features and Image Enhancement Module (IEM) to enhance the 3D spatial awareness of camera features from 3D voxel features. We then introduce Unified Fusion (U-Fusion) to adaptively fuse the enhanced features from the last stage to build a unified representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our BiCo-Fusion against the prior arts.

At the scene level, existing SSL methods often incorporate volume rendering into the pre-training framework, using RGB-D images as reconstruction signals to facilitate cross-modal learning. This strategy promotes alignment between 2D and 3D modalities and enables the model to benefit from rich visual cues in the RGB-D inputs. However, these approaches are limited by their reliance on implicit scene representations and high memory demands. Furthermore, since their reconstruction objectives are applied only in 2D space, they often fail to capture underlying 3D geometric structures. To address these challenges, we propose Gaussian2Scene, a novel scene-level SSL framework that leverages the efficiency and explicit nature of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) for pre-training. The use of 3DGS not only alleviates the computational burden associated with volume rendering but also supports direct 3D scene reconstruction, thereby enhancing the geometric understanding of the backbone network. Our approach follows a progressive two-stage training strategy. In the first stage, a dual-branch masked autoencoder learns both 2D and 3D scene representations. In the second stage, we initialize training with reconstructed point clouds and further supervise learning using the geometric locations of Gaussian primitives and rendered RGB images. This process reinforces both geometric and cross-modal learning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Gaussian2Scene across several downstream 3D object detection tasks, showing consistent improvements over existing pre-training methods.</p></details> |  |

High-quality datasets are crucial for their development, and there is growing interest in datasets composed of neural networks themselves to support benchmarking, automated machine learning (AutoML), and model analysis. We introduce LEMUR, an open source dataset of neural network models with well-structured code for diverse architectures across tasks such as object detection, image classification, segmentation, and natural language processing.

| **[Exploring Test-Time Adaptation for Object Detection in Continually Changing Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16439v5)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world application models are commonly deployed in dynamic environments, where the target domain distribution undergoes temporal changes. Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) has recently emerged as a promising technique to gradually adapt a source-trained model to continually changing target domains. Despite recent advancements in addressing CTTA, two critical issues remain: 1) Fixed thresholds for pseudo-labeling in existing methodologies lead to low-quality pseudo-labels, as model confidence varies across categories and domains; 2) Stochastic parameter restoration methods for mitigating catastrophic forgetting fail to preserve critical information effectively, due to their intrinsic randomness. To tackle these challenges for detection models in CTTA scenarios, we present AMROD, featuring three core components. Firstly, the object-level contrastive learning module extracts object-level features for contrastive learning to refine the feature representation in the target domain. Secondly, the adaptive monitoring module dynamically skips unnecessary adaptation and updates the category-specific threshold based on predicted confidence scores to enable efficiency and improve the quality of pseudo-labels. Lastly, the adaptive randomized restoration mechanism selectively reset inactive parameters with higher possibilities, ensuring the retention of essential knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of AMROD on four CTTA object detection tasks, where AMROD outperforms existing methods, especially achieving a 3.2 mAP improvement and a 20\% increase in efficiency on the Cityscapes-to-Cityscapes-C CTTA task. The code of this work is available at https://github.com/ShileiCao/AMROD.</p></details> |  |

However, acquiring high-quality labeled data is often costly and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we proposes a multi-modal self-supervised learning framework that leverages high-resolution RGB images, multi-spectral data, and digital surface models (DSM) for pre-training. By designing an information-aware adaptive masking strategy, cross-modal masking mechanism, and multi-task self-supervised objectives, the framework effectively captures both the correlations across different modalities and the unique feature structures within each modality. We evaluated the proposed method on multiple downstream tasks, covering typical remote sensing applications such as scene classification, semantic segmentation, change detection, object detection, and depth estimation. Experiments are conducted on 15 remote sensing datasets, encompassing 26 tasks. The results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing pretraining approaches in most tasks. Specifically, on the Potsdam and Vaihingen semantic segmentation tasks, our method achieved mIoU scores of 78.30\% and 76.50\%, with only 50\% train-set. For the US3D depth estimation task, the RMSE error is reduced to 0.182, and for the binary change detection task in SECOND dataset, our method achieved mIoU scores of 47.51\%, surpassing the second CS-MAE by 3 percentage points. Our pretrain code, checkpoints, and HR-Pairs dataset can be found in https://github.com/CVEO/MSSDF.</p></details> |  |

We focus on deploying the YOLOv4-Tiny model, a compact convolutional neural network, optimized through post-training quantization to INT8 precision. The model is trained on a custom-curated aerial emergency dataset, consisting of 10,820 annotated images covering critical emergency scenarios. Unlike prior works that rely on publicly available datasets, we created this dataset ourselves due to the lack of publicly available drone-view emergency imagery, making the dataset itself a key contribution of this work. The quantized model is evaluated against YOLOv5-small across multiple metrics, including mean Average Precision (mAP), F1 score, inference time, and model size. Experimental results demonstrate that the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny achieves comparable detection performance while reducing the model size from 22.5 MB to 6.4 MB and improving inference speed by 44\%. With a 71\% reduction in model size and a 44\% increase in inference speed, the quantized YOLOv4-Tiny model proves highly suitable for real-time emergency detection on low-power edge devices.</p></details> | 6 Pages, 3 figures |

It is especially challenging to capture rare edge cases, which play a critical role in training and testing of an AV system. To address this challenge, we introduce the Cosmos-Drive-Dreams - a synthetic data generation (SDG) pipeline that aims to generate challenging scenarios to facilitate downstream tasks such as perception and driving policy training. Powering this pipeline is Cosmos-Drive, a suite of models specialized from NVIDIA Cosmos world foundation model for the driving domain and are capable of controllable, high-fidelity, multi-view, and spatiotemporally consistent driving video generation. We showcase the utility of these models by applying Cosmos-Drive-Dreams to scale the quantity and diversity of driving datasets with high-fidelity and challenging scenarios. Experimentally, we demonstrate that our generated data helps in mitigating long-tail distribution problems and enhances generalization in downstream tasks such as 3D lane detection, 3D object detection and driving policy learning.

To overcome this constraint, we introduce ADAM: Autonomous Discovery and Annotation Model, a training-free, self-refining framework for open-world object labeling. ADAM leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate candidate labels for unknown objects based on contextual information from known entities within a scene. These labels are paired with visual embeddings from CLIP to construct an Embedding-Label Repository (ELR) that enables inference without category supervision. For a newly encountered unknown object, ADAM retrieves visually similar instances from the ELR and applies frequency-based voting and cross-modal re-ranking to assign a robust label. To further enhance consistency, we introduce a self-refinement loop that re-evaluates repository labels using visual cohesion analysis and k-nearest-neighbor-based majority re-labeling. Experimental results on the COCO and PASCAL datasets demonstrate that ADAM effectively annotates novel categories using only visual and contextual signals, without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.</p></details> |  |

However, the accumulated noise in such dense representations has received insufficient attention, which degrades the representation quality and increases the likelihood of missed detections. To address this challenge, we propose the Wavelet Denoising-enhanced DEtection TRansformer, i.e., WD-DETR network, for event cameras. In particular, a dense event representation is presented first, which enables real-time reconstruction of events as tensors. Then, a wavelet transform method is designed to filter noise in the event representations. Such a method is integrated into the backbone for feature extraction. The extracted features are subsequently fed into a transformer-based network for object prediction. To further reduce inference time, we incorporate the Dynamic Reorganization Convolution Block (DRCB) as a fusion module within the hybrid encoder. The proposed method has been evaluated on three event-based object detection datasets, i.e., DSEC, Gen1, and 1Mpx. The results demonstrate that WD-DETR outperforms tested state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we implement our approach on a common onboard computer for robots, the NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX, achieving a high frame rate of approximately 35 FPS using TensorRT FP16, which is exceptionally well-suited for real-time perception of onboard robotic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://youtu.be/AQAgVdrx1DE</p></details> |
| **[ATAS: Any-to-Any Self-Distillation for Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Dense Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08678v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models such as CLIP have recently propelled open-vocabulary dense prediction tasks by enabling recognition of a broad range of visual concepts. However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.</p></details> |  |

However, new objects frequently appear in the real world, requiring detection models to continually learn without suffering from catastrophic forgetting. Although Incremental Object Detection (IOD) has emerged to address this challenge, these existing models are still not practical due to their limited performance and prolonged inference time. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for IOD, called Hier-DETR: Hierarchical Neural Collapse Detection Transformer, ensuring both efficiency and competitive performance by leveraging Neural Collapse for imbalance dataset and Hierarchical relation of classes' labels.</p></details> |  |

While tools like LabelImg can handle the labeling task, some of them still require annotators to manually label each image. In this paper, we introduce BakuFlow, a streamlining semi-automatic label generation tool. Key features include (1) a live adjustable magnifier for pixel-precise manual corrections, improving user experience; (2) an interactive data augmentation module to diversify training datasets; (3) label propagation for rapidly copying labeled objects between consecutive frames, greatly accelerating annotation of video data; and (4) an automatic labeling module powered by a modified YOLOE framework. Unlike the original YOLOE, our extension supports adding new object classes and any number of visual prompts per class during annotation, enabling flexible and scalable labeling for dynamic, real-world datasets. These innovations make BakuFlow especially effective for object detection and tracking, substantially reducing labeling workload and improving efficiency in practical computer vision and industrial scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

This paper focuses on the task of object detection in the setting where object classes follow a natural long-tailed distribution. Existing methods for long-tailed detection resort to external ImageNet labels to augment the low-shot training instances. However, such dependency on a large labeled database has limited utility in practical scenarios. We propose a versatile and scalable approach to leverage optional unlabeled images, which are easy to collect without the burden of human annotations. Our SimLTD framework is straightforward and intuitive, and consists of three simple steps: (1) pre-training on abundant head classes; (2) transfer learning on scarce tail classes; and (3) fine-tuning on a sampled set of both head and tail classes. Our approach can be viewed as an improved head-to-tail model transfer paradigm without the added complexities of meta-learning or knowledge distillation, as was required in past research. By harnessing supplementary unlabeled images, without extra image labels, SimLTD establishes new record results on the challenging LVIS v1 benchmark across both supervised and semi-supervised settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025.

This study introduces CrosswalkNet, a robust and efficient deep learning framework designed to detect various types of pedestrian crosswalks from 15-cm resolution aerial images. CrosswalkNet incorporates a novel detection approach that improves upon traditional object detection strategies by utilizing oriented bounding boxes (OBB), enhancing detection precision by accurately capturing crosswalks regardless of their orientation. Several optimization techniques, including Convolutional Block Attention, a dual-branch Spatial Pyramid Pooling-Fast module, and cosine annealing, are implemented to maximize performance and efficiency. A comprehensive dataset comprising over 23,000 annotated crosswalk instances is utilized to train and validate the proposed framework. The best-performing model achieves an impressive precision of 96.5% and a recall of 93.3% on aerial imagery from Massachusetts, demonstrating its accuracy and effectiveness. CrosswalkNet has also been successfully applied to datasets from New Hampshire, Virginia, and Maine without transfer learning or fine-tuning, showcasing its robustness and strong generalization capability. Additionally, the crosswalk detection results, processed using High-Performance Computing (HPC) platforms and provided in polygon shapefile format, have been shown to accelerate data processing and detection, supporting real-time analysis for safety and mobility applications. This integration offers policymakers, transportation engineers, and urban planners an effective instrument to enhance pedestrian safety and improve urban mobility.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM2Auto: Auto Annotation Using FLASH](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07850v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Out-of-Distribution Objects through Class-Conditioned Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03292v3)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent object detectors have achieved impressive accuracy in identifying objects seen during training. However, real-world deployment often introduces novel and unexpected objects, referred to as out-of-distribution (OOD) objects, posing significant challenges to model trustworthiness. Modern object detectors are typically overconfident, making it unreliable to use their predictions alone for OOD detection. To address this, we propose leveraging an auxiliary model as a complementary solution. Specifically, we utilize an off-the-shelf text-to-image generative model, such as Stable Diffusion, which is trained with objective functions distinct from those of discriminative object detectors. We hypothesize that this fundamental difference enables the detection of OOD objects by measuring inconsistencies between the models. Concretely, for a given detected object bounding box and its predicted in-distribution class label, we perform class-conditioned inpainting on the image with the object removed. If the object is OOD, the inpainted image is likely to deviate significantly from the original, making the reconstruction error a robust indicator of OOD status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently surpasses existing zero-shot and non-zero-shot OOD detection methods, establishing a robust framework for enhancing object detection systems in dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |

Fusing these complementary modalities enhances scene understanding, particularly for advanced vision tasks under challenging conditions. Recently, deep learning-based fusion methods have gained attention, but current evaluations primarily rely on general-purpose metrics without standardized benchmarks or downstream task performance. Additionally, the lack of well-developed dual-spectrum datasets and fair algorithm comparisons hinders progress. To address these gaps, we construct a high-quality dual-spectrum dataset captured in campus environments, comprising 1,369 well-aligned visible-infrared image pairs across four representative scenarios: daytime, nighttime, smoke occlusion, and underpasses. We also propose a comprehensive and fair evaluation framework that integrates fusion speed, general metrics, and object detection performance using the lang-segment-anything model to ensure fairness in downstream evaluation. Extensive experiments benchmark several state-of-the-art fusion algorithms under this framework. Results demonstrate that fusion models optimized for downstream tasks achieve superior performance in target detection, especially in low-light and occluded scenes. Notably, some algorithms that perform well on general metrics do not translate to strong downstream performance, highlighting limitations of current evaluation practices and validating the necessity of our proposed framework. The main contributions of this work are: (1)a campus-oriented dual-spectrum dataset with diverse and challenging scenes; (2) a task-aware, comprehensive evaluation framework; and (3) thorough comparative analysis of leading fusion methods across multiple datasets, offering insights for future development.</p></details> | 11 pages, 13 figures |

However, most existing works focus on designing architectures and constructing visual cues only for the specific task, which ignores the potential uniformity introduced by the DL paradigm. In this paper, we attempt to construct a novel $\underline{ComP}$lementary $\underline{tr}$ansformer, $\textbf{ComPtr}$, for diverse bi-source dense prediction tasks. Specifically, unlike existing methods that over-specialize in a single task or a subset of tasks, ComPtr starts from the more general concept of bi-source dense prediction. Based on the basic dependence on information complementarity, we propose consistency enhancement and difference awareness components with which ComPtr can evacuate and collect important visual semantic cues from different image sources for diverse tasks, respectively. ComPtr treats different inputs equally and builds an efficient dense interaction model in the form of sequence-to-sequence on top of the transformer. This task-generic design provides a smooth foundation for constructing the unified model that can simultaneously deal with various bi-source information. In extensive experiments across several representative vision tasks, i.e. remote sensing change detection, RGB-T crowd counting, RGB-D/T salient object detection, and RGB-D semantic segmentation, the proposed method consistently obtains favorable performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/lartpang/ComPtr.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DetAny3D, a promptable 3D detection foundation model capable of detecting any novel object under arbitrary camera configurations using only monocular inputs. Training a foundation model for 3D detection is fundamentally constrained by the limited availability of annotated 3D data, which motivates DetAny3D to leverage the rich prior knowledge embedded in extensively pre-trained 2D foundation models to compensate for this scarcity. To effectively transfer 2D knowledge to 3D, DetAny3D incorporates two core modules: the 2D Aggregator, which aligns features from different 2D foundation models, and the 3D Interpreter with Zero-Embedding Mapping, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting in 2D-to-3D knowledge transfer. Experimental results validate the strong generalization of our DetAny3D, which not only achieves state-of-the-art performance on unseen categories and novel camera configurations, but also surpasses most competitors on in-domain data.DetAny3D sheds light on the potential of the 3D foundation model for diverse applications in real-world scenarios, e.g., rare object detection in autonomous driving, and demonstrates promise for further exploration of 3D-centric tasks in open-world settings.

| **[Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution for Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05369v7)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dilated convolution, which expands the receptive field by inserting gaps between its consecutive elements, is widely employed in computer vision. In this study, we propose three strategies to improve individual phases of dilated convolution from the view of spectrum analysis. Departing from the conventional practice of fixing a global dilation rate as a hyperparameter, we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Dilated Convolution (FADC), which dynamically adjusts dilation rates spatially based on local frequency components. Subsequently, we design two plug-in modules to directly enhance effective bandwidth and receptive field size. The Adaptive Kernel (AdaKern) module decomposes convolution weights into low-frequency and high-frequency components, dynamically adjusting the ratio between these components on a per-channel basis. By increasing the high-frequency part of convolution weights, AdaKern captures more high-frequency components, thereby improving effective bandwidth. The Frequency Selection (FreqSelect) module optimally balances high- and low-frequency components in feature representations through spatially variant reweighting. It suppresses high frequencies in the background to encourage FADC to learn a larger dilation, thereby increasing the receptive field for an expanded scope.

| **[Multiple Object Stitching for Unsupervised Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07364v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning for single object centric images has achieved remarkable progress on unsupervised representation, but suffering inferior performance on the widespread images with multiple objects. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective method, Multiple Object Stitching (MOS), to refine the unsupervised representation for multi-object images. Specifically, we construct the multi-object images by stitching the single object centric ones, where the objects in the synthesized multi-object images are predetermined. Hence, compared to the existing contrastive methods, our method provides additional object correspondences between multi-object images without human annotations. In this manner, our method pays more attention to the representations of each object in multi-object image, thus providing more detailed representations for complicated downstream tasks, such as object detection and semantic segmentation. Experimental results on ImageNet, CIFAR and COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed method achieves the leading unsupervised representation performance on both single object centric images and multi-object ones.

| **[SMMT: Siamese Motion Mamba with Self-attention for Thermal Infrared Target Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04088v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Thermal infrared (TIR) object tracking often suffers from challenges such as target occlusion, motion blur, and background clutter, which significantly degrade the performance of trackers. To address these issues, this paper pro-poses a novel Siamese Motion Mamba Tracker (SMMT), which integrates a bidirectional state-space model and a self-attention mechanism. Specifically, we introduce the Motion Mamba module into the Siamese architecture to ex-tract motion features and recover overlooked edge details using bidirectional modeling and self-attention. We propose a Siamese parameter-sharing strate-gy that allows certain convolutional layers to share weights. This approach reduces computational redundancy while preserving strong feature represen-tation. In addition, we design a motion edge-aware regression loss to improve tracking accuracy, especially for motion-blurred targets. Extensive experi-ments are conducted on four TIR tracking benchmarks, including LSOTB-TIR, PTB-TIR, VOT-TIR2015, and VOT-TIR 2017. The results show that SMMT achieves superior performance in TIR target tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Cooperative Multi-Object Tracking using Graph Signal Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09469v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) plays a crucial role in autonomous driving systems, as it lays the foundations for advanced perception and precise path planning modules. Nonetheless, single agent based MOT lacks in sensing surroundings due to occlusions, sensors failures, etc. Hence, the integration of multiagent information is essential for comprehensive understanding of the environment. This paper proposes a novel Cooperative MOT framework for tracking objects in 3D LiDAR scene by formulating and solving a graph topology-aware optimization problem so as to fuse information coming from multiple vehicles. By exploiting a fully connected graph topology defined by the detected bounding boxes, we employ the Graph Laplacian processing optimization technique to smooth the position error of bounding boxes and effectively combine them. In that manner, we reveal and leverage inherent coherences of diverse multi-agent detections, and associate the refined bounding boxes to tracked objects at two stages, optimizing localization and tracking accuracies. An extensive evaluation study has been conducted, using the real-world V2V4Real dataset, where the proposed method significantly outperforms the baseline frameworks, including the state-of-the-art deep-learning DMSTrack and V2V4Real, in various testing sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo Workshops, 3DMM - 3D Multimedia Analytics, Search and Generation</p></details> |
| **[Neuromorphic Optical Tracking and Imaging of Randomly Moving Targets through Strongly Scattering Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03874v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking and acquiring simultaneous optical images of randomly moving targets obscured by scattering media remains a challenging problem of importance to many applications that require precise object localization and identification. In this work we develop an end-to-end neuromorphic optical engineering and computational approach to demonstrate how to track and image normally invisible objects by combining an event detecting camera with a multistage neuromorphic deep learning strategy. Photons emerging from dense scattering media are detected by the event camera and converted to pixel-wise asynchronized spike trains - a first step in isolating object-specific information from the dominant uninformative background. Spiking data is fed into a deep spiking neural network (SNN) engine where object tracking and image reconstruction are performed by two separate yet interconnected modules running in parallel in discrete time steps over the event duration. Through benchtop experiments we demonstrate tracking and imaging randomly moving objects in dense turbid media as well as image reconstruction of spatially stationary but optically dynamic objects. Standardized character sets serve as representative proxies for geometrically complex objects, underscoring the method's generality. The results highlight the advantages of a fully neuromorphic approach in meeting a major imaging technology with high computational efficiency and low power consumption.</p></details> | 26 pages, 6 figures |

This work addresses two pivotal challenges, namely, the implementation and the orchestration of the migration process. We first introduce a novel framework that efficiently implements stateful migration and effectively orchestrates the migration process by fulfilling both network and application KPI targets. Through experimental validation using realistic microservices, we then show that our solution (i) greatly improves migration performance, yielding up to 77% decrease of the migration downtime with respect to the state of the art, and (ii) successfully addresses the strict user QoE requirements of critical scenarios featuring latency-sensitive microservices. Further, we consider two practical use cases, featuring, respectively, a UAV autopilot microservice and a multi-object tracking task, and demonstrate how our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in configuring the migration process and in meeting KPI targets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM2Auto: Auto Annotation Using FLASH](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07850v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) lag behind Large Language Models due to the scarcity of annotated datasets, as creating paired visual-textual annotations is labor-intensive and expensive. To address this bottleneck, we introduce SAM2Auto, the first fully automated annotation pipeline for video datasets requiring no human intervention or dataset-specific training. Our approach consists of two key components: SMART-OD, a robust object detection system that combines automatic mask generation with open-world object detection capabilities, and FLASH (Frame-Level Annotation and Segmentation Handler), a multi-object real-time video instance segmentation (VIS) that maintains consistent object identification across video frames even with intermittent detection gaps. Unlike existing open-world detection methods that require frame-specific hyperparameter tuning and suffer from numerous false positives, our system employs statistical approaches to minimize detection errors while ensuring consistent object tracking throughout entire video sequences. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates that SAM2Auto achieves comparable accuracy to manual annotation while dramatically reducing annotation time and eliminating labor costs. The system successfully handles diverse datasets without requiring retraining or extensive parameter adjustments, making it a practical solution for large-scale dataset creation. Our work establishes a new baseline for automated video annotation and provides a pathway for accelerating VLM development by addressing the fundamental dataset bottleneck that has constrained progress in vision-language understanding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Expectation Propagation for Multi-Object Tracking over Sensor Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18795v2)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel distributed expectation propagation algorithm for multiple sensors, multiple objects tracking in cluttered environments. The proposed framework enables each sensor to operate locally while collaboratively exchanging moment estimates with other sensors, thus eliminating the need to transmit all data to a central processing node. Specifically, we introduce a fast and parallelisable Rao-Blackwellised Gibbs sampling scheme to approximate the tilted distributions, which enhances the accuracy and efficiency of expectation propagation updates. Results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves both communication and inference efficiency for multi-object tracking tasks with dynamic sensor connectivity and varying clutter levels.</p></details> |  |
| **[FRAME: Pre-Training Video Feature Representations via Anticipation and Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05543v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense video prediction tasks, such as object tracking and semantic segmentation, require video encoders that generate temporally consistent, spatially dense features for every frame. However, existing approaches fall short: image encoders like DINO or CLIP lack temporal awareness, while video models such as VideoMAE underperform compared to image encoders on dense prediction tasks. We address this gap with FRAME, a self-supervised video frame encoder tailored for dense video understanding. FRAME learns to predict current and future DINO patch features from past and present RGB frames, leading to spatially precise and temporally coherent representations. To our knowledge, FRAME is the first video encoder to leverage image-based models for dense prediction while outperforming them on tasks requiring fine-grained visual correspondence. As an auxiliary capability, FRAME aligns its class token with CLIP's semantic space, supporting language-driven tasks such as video classification. We evaluate FRAME across six dense prediction tasks on seven datasets, where it consistently outperforms image encoders and existing self-supervised video models. Despite its versatility, FRAME maintains a compact architecture suitable for a range of downstream applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contour Errors: An Ego-Centric Metric for Reliable 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04122v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.</p></details> |  |
| **[SportMamba: Adaptive Non-Linear Multi-Object Tracking with State Space Models for Team Sports](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03335v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in team sports is particularly challenging due to the fast-paced motion and frequent occlusions resulting in motion blur and identity switches, respectively. Predicting player positions in such scenarios is particularly difficult due to the observed highly non-linear motion patterns. Current methods are heavily reliant on object detection and appearance-based tracking, which struggle to perform in complex team sports scenarios, where appearance cues are ambiguous and motion patterns do not necessarily follow a linear pattern. To address these challenges, we introduce SportMamba, an adaptive hybrid MOT technique specifically designed for tracking in dynamic team sports. The technical contribution of SportMamba is twofold. First, we introduce a mamba-attention mechanism that models non-linear motion by implicitly focusing on relevant embedding dependencies. Second, we propose a height-adaptive spatial association metric to reduce ID switches caused by partial occlusions by accounting for scale variations due to depth changes. Additionally, we extend the detection search space with adaptive buffers to improve associations in fast-motion scenarios. Our proposed technique, SportMamba, demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various metrics in the SportsMOT dataset, which is characterized by complex motion and severe occlusion. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization capability through zero-shot transfer to VIP-HTD, an ice hockey dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at CVSports IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Workshops (CVPRW'25).

| **[MVTD: A Benchmark Dataset for Maritime Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02866v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is a fundamental task with widespread applications in autonomous navigation, surveillance, and maritime robotics. Despite significant advances in generic object tracking, maritime environments continue to present unique challenges, including specular water reflections, low-contrast targets, dynamically changing backgrounds, and frequent occlusions. These complexities significantly degrade the performance of state-of-the-art tracking algorithms, highlighting the need for domain-specific datasets. To address this gap, we introduce the Maritime Visual Tracking Dataset (MVTD), a comprehensive and publicly available benchmark specifically designed for maritime VOT. MVTD comprises 182 high-resolution video sequences, totaling approximately 150,000 frames, and includes four representative object classes: boat, ship, sailboat, and unmanned surface vehicle (USV). The dataset captures a diverse range of operational conditions and maritime scenarios, reflecting the real-world complexities of maritime environments. We evaluated 14 recent SOTA tracking algorithms on the MVTD benchmark and observed substantial performance degradation compared to their performance on general-purpose datasets. However, when fine-tuned on MVTD, these models demonstrate significant performance gains, underscoring the effectiveness of domain adaptation and the importance of transfer learning in specialized tracking contexts. The MVTD dataset fills a critical gap in the visual tracking community by providing a realistic and challenging benchmark for maritime scenarios.

In this paper, we extensively investigate the robustness of existing RGBD-based 6DoF pose estimation methods against varying levels of depth sensor noise. We highlight that existing 6DoF pose estimation methods suffer significant performance discrepancies due to depth measurement inaccuracies. In response to the robustness issue, we present a simple and effective transformer-based 6DoF pose estimation approach called DTTDNet, featuring a novel geometric feature filtering module and a Chamfer distance loss for training. Moreover, we advance the field of robust 6DoF pose estimation and introduce a new dataset -- Digital Twin Tracking Dataset Mobile (DTTD-Mobile), tailored for digital twin object tracking with noisy depth data from the mobile RGBD sensor suite of the Apple iPhone 14 Pro. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTTDNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods at least 4.32, up to 60.74 points in ADD metrics on the DTTD-Mobile. More importantly, our approach exhibits superior robustness to varying levels of measurement noise, setting a new benchmark for robustness to measurement noise.

| **[No Train Yet Gain: Towards Generic Multi-Object Tracking in Sports and Beyond](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01373v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for sports analytics, enabling performance evaluation and tactical insights. However, tracking in sports is challenging due to fast movements, occlusions, and camera shifts. Traditional tracking-by-detection methods require extensive tuning, while segmentation-based approaches struggle with track processing. We propose McByte, a tracking-by-detection framework that integrates temporally propagated segmentation mask as an association cue to improve robustness without per-video tuning. Unlike many existing methods, McByte does not require training, relying solely on pre-trained models and object detectors commonly used in the community. Evaluated on SportsMOT, DanceTrack, SoccerNet-tracking 2022 and MOT17, McByte demonstrates strong performance across sports and general pedestrian tracking. Our results highlight the benefits of mask propagation for a more adaptable and generalizable MOT approach. Code will be made available at https://github.com/tstanczyk95/McByte.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depth-Aware Scoring and Hierarchical Alignment for Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00774v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current motion-based multiple object tracking (MOT) approaches rely heavily on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for object association. Without using 3D features, they are ineffective in scenarios with occlusions or visually similar objects. To address this, our paper presents a novel depth-aware framework for MOT. We estimate depth using a zero-shot approach and incorporate it as an independent feature in the association process. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical Alignment Score that refines IoU by integrating both coarse bounding box overlap and fine-grained (pixel-level) alignment to improve association accuracy without requiring additional learnable parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first MOT framework to incorporate 3D features (monocular depth) as an independent decision matrix in the association step. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks without any training nor fine-tuning.

| **[Camouflaged Object Tracking: A Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13877v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tracking has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by the availability of large-scale training datasets that have enabled the development of highly accurate and robust algorithms. While significant progress has been made in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such as tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which blend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique challenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge is particularly critical in applications such as military, security, agriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged objects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object Tracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for evaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200 sequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals significant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS, which demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for camouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable at https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSF-Net: Spatial-Spectral Fusion Network with Spectral Angle Awareness for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05852v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral video (HSV) offers valuable spatial, spectral, and temporal information simultaneously, making it highly suitable for handling challenges such as background clutter and visual similarity in object tracking. However, existing methods primarily focus on band regrouping and rely on RGB trackers for feature extraction, resulting in limited exploration of spectral information and difficulties in achieving complementary representations of object features. In this paper, a spatial-spectral fusion network with spectral angle awareness (SST-Net) is proposed for hyperspectral (HS) object tracking. Firstly, to address the issue of insufficient spectral feature extraction in existing networks, a spatial-spectral feature backbone ($S^2$FB) is designed. With the spatial and spectral extraction branch, a joint representation of texture and spectrum is obtained. Secondly, a spectral attention fusion module (SAFM) is presented to capture the intra- and inter-modality correlation to obtain the fused features from the HS and RGB modalities. It can incorporate the visual information into the HS spectral context to form a robust representation. Thirdly, to ensure a more accurate response of the tracker to the object position, a spectral angle awareness module (SAAM) investigates the region-level spectral similarity between the template and search images during the prediction stage. Furthermore, we develop a novel spectral angle awareness loss (SAAL) to offer guidance for the SAAM based on similar regions. Finally, to obtain the robust tracking results, a weighted prediction method is considered to combine the HS and RGB predicted motions of objects to leverage the strengths of each modality. Extensive experiments on the HOTC dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SSF-Net, compared with state-of-the-art trackers.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing 2025</p></details> |

While existing 3D object detection approaches operate globally and implicitly rely on the a priori existence of metric camera poses, our method, Rooms from Motion (RfM) operates on a collection of un-posed images. By replacing the standard 2D keypoint-based matcher of structure-from-motion with an object-centric matcher based on image-derived 3D boxes, we estimate metric camera poses, object tracks, and finally produce a global, semantic 3D object map. When a priori pose is available, we can significantly improve map quality through optimization of global 3D boxes against individual observations. RfM shows strong localization performance and subsequently produces maps of higher quality than leading point-based and multi-view 3D object detection methods on CA-1M and ScanNet++, despite these global methods relying on overparameterization through point clouds or dense volumes. Rooms from Motion achieves a general, object-centric representation which not only extends the work of Cubify Anything to full scenes but also allows for inherently sparse localization and parametric mapping proportional to the number of objects in a scene.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Scaling Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19990v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a progressive scaling training strategy for visual object tracking, systematically analyzing the influence of training data volume, model size, and input resolution on tracking performance. Our empirical study reveals that while scaling each factor leads to significant improvements in tracking accuracy, naive training suffers from suboptimal optimization and limited iterative refinement. To address this issue, we introduce DT-Training, a progressive scaling framework that integrates small teacher transfer and dual-branch alignment to maximize model potential. The resulting scaled tracker consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and transferability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we validate the broader applicability of our approach to additional tasks, underscoring its versatility beyond tracking.</p></details> |  |

This requires mechanisms that can both identify semantically related objects across images and accurately produce segmentation masks. We note that Segment Anything 2 (SAM2), with its prompt-and-propagate mechanism, offers both strong segmentation capabilities and a built-in feature matching process. However, we show that its representations are entangled with task-specific cues optimized for object tracking, which impairs its use for tasks requiring higher level semantic understanding. Our key insight is that, despite its class-agnostic pretraining, SAM2 already encodes rich semantic structure in its features. We propose SANSA (Semantically AligNed Segment Anything 2), a framework that makes this latent structure explicit, and repurposes SAM2 for few-shot segmentation through minimal task-specific modifications. SANSA achieves state-of-the-art performance on few-shot segmentation benchmarks specifically designed to assess generalization, outperforms generalist methods in the popular in-context setting, supports various prompts flexible interaction via points, boxes, or scribbles, and remains significantly faster and more compact than prior approaches.

| **[Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11496v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a significant application of multi-source information fusion in intelligent transportation perception systems, Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) involves localizing and tracking specific objects in video sequences based on language references. However, existing RMOT approaches often treat language descriptions as holistic embeddings and struggle to effectively integrate the rich semantic information contained in language expressions with visual features. This limitation is especially apparent in complex scenes requiring comprehensive understanding of both static object attributes and spatial motion information. In this paper, we propose a Cognitive Disentanglement for Referring Multi-Object Tracking (CDRMT) framework that addresses these challenges. It adapts the "what" and "where" pathways from the human visual processing system to RMOT tasks. Specifically, our framework first establishes cross-modal connections while preserving modality-specific characteristics. It then disentangles language descriptions and hierarchically injects them into object queries, refining object understanding from coarse to fine-grained semantic levels. Finally, we reconstruct language representations based on visual features, ensuring that tracked objects faithfully reflect the referring expression. Extensive experiments on different benchmark datasets demonstrate that CDRMT achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art methods, with average gains of 6.0% in HOTA score on Refer-KITTI and 3.2% on Refer-KITTI-V2. Our approach advances the state-of-the-art in RMOT while simultaneously providing new insights into multi-source information fusion.</p></details> | 27 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Fully Spiking Neural Networks for Unified Frame-Event Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20834v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of image and event streams offers a promising approach for achieving robust visual object tracking in complex environments. However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.

Its task form is to guide the models to track the objects that conform to the language instruction. However, the RMOT task commonly requires clear language instructions, such methods often fail to work when complex language instructions with reasoning characteristics appear. In this work, we propose a new task, called Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT). ReaMOT is a more challenging task that requires accurate reasoning about objects that match the language instruction with reasoning characteristic and tracking the objects' trajectories. To advance the ReaMOT task and evaluate the reasoning capabilities of tracking models, we construct ReaMOT Challenge, a reasoning-based multi-object tracking benchmark built upon 12 datasets. Specifically, it comprises 1,156 language instructions with reasoning characteristic, 423,359 image-language pairs, and 869 diverse scenes, which is divided into three levels of reasoning difficulty. In addition, we propose a set of evaluation metrics tailored for the ReaMOT task. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework for reasoning-based multi-object tracking based on large vision-language models (LVLM) and SAM2, as a baseline for the ReaMOT task.

Traditional statistical model-based tracking methods rely on predefined motion models and assumptions about system noise distributions. Although computationally efficient, they often lack adaptability to varying traffic scenarios and require extensive manual design and parameter tuning. To address these issues, we propose a novel 3D multi-object tracking approach for vehicles, HybridTrack, which integrates a data-driven Kalman Filter (KF) within a tracking-by-detection paradigm. In particular, it learns the transition residual and Kalman gain directly from data, which eliminates the need for manual motion and stochastic parameter modeling. Validated on the real-world KITTI dataset, HybridTrack achieves 82.72% HOTA accuracy, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods. We also evaluate our method under different configurations, achieving the fastest processing speed of 112 FPS. Consequently, HybridTrack eliminates the dependency on scene-specific designs while improving performance and maintaining real-time efficiency.

Yet, both autonomous animal-reactive flight control beyond visual line of sight and/or mission-specific individual and behaviour recognition tasks rely to some degree on this capability. In response, we introduce WildLive - a near real-time animal detection and tracking framework for high-resolution imagery running directly onboard uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). The system performs multi-animal detection and tracking at 17.81fps for HD and 7.53fps on 4K video streams suitable for operation during higher altitude flights to minimise animal disturbance. Our system is optimised for Jetson Orin AGX onboard hardware. It integrates the efficiency of sparse optical flow tracking and mission-specific sampling with device-optimised and proven YOLO-driven object detection and segmentation techniques. Essentially, computational resource is focused onto spatio-temporal regions of high uncertainty to significantly improve UAV processing speeds. Alongside, we introduce our WildLive dataset, which comprises 200K+ annotated animal instances across 19K+ frames from 4K UAV videos collected at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy in Kenya. All frames contain ground truth bounding boxes, segmentation masks, as well as individual tracklets and tracking point trajectories. We compare our system against current object tracking approaches including OC-SORT, ByteTrack, and SORT. Our multi-animal tracking experiments with onboard hardware confirm that near real-time high-resolution wildlife tracking is possible on UAVs whilst maintaining high accuracy levels as needed for future navigational and mission-specific animal-centric operational autonomy.

| **[A Framework for Multi-View Multiple Object Tracking using Single-View Multi-Object Trackers on Fish Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17201v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in computer vision has made significant advancements, yet tracking small fish in underwater environments presents unique challenges due to complex 3D motions and data noise. Traditional single-view MOT models often fall short in these settings. This thesis addresses these challenges by adapting state-of-the-art single-view MOT models, FairMOT and YOLOv8, for underwater fish detecting and tracking in ecological studies. The core contribution of this research is the development of a multi-view framework that utilizes stereo video inputs to enhance tracking accuracy and fish behavior pattern recognition. By integrating and evaluating these models on underwater fish video datasets, the study aims to demonstrate significant improvements in precision and reliability compared to single-view approaches. The proposed framework detects fish entities with a relative accuracy of 47% and employs stereo-matching techniques to produce a novel 3D output, providing a more comprehensive understanding of fish movements and interactions</p></details> |  |
| **[LiDAR MOT-DETR: A LiDAR-based Two-Stage Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12753v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking from LiDAR point clouds presents unique challenges due to the sparse and irregular nature of the data, compounded by the need for temporal coherence across frames. Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.722 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.</p></details> | Template change |
| **[Temporal Object Captioning for Street Scene Videos from LiDAR Tracks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16594v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video captioning models have seen notable advancements in recent years, especially with regard to their ability to capture temporal information. While many research efforts have focused on architectural advancements, such as temporal attention mechanisms, there remains a notable gap in understanding how models capture and utilize temporal semantics for effective temporal feature extraction, especially in the context of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. We propose an automated LiDAR-based captioning procedure that focuses on the temporal dynamics of traffic participants. Our approach uses a rule-based system to extract essential details such as lane position and relative motion from object tracks, followed by a template-based caption generation. Our findings show that training SwinBERT, a video captioning model, using only front camera images and supervised with our template-based captions, specifically designed to encapsulate fine-grained temporal behavior, leads to improved temporal understanding consistently across three datasets. In conclusion, our results clearly demonstrate that integrating LiDAR-based caption supervision significantly enhances temporal understanding, effectively addressing and reducing the inherent visual/static biases prevalent in current state-of-the-art model architectures.</p></details> |  |

| **[Spectral Image Tokenizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09607v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image tokenizers map images to sequences of discrete tokens, and are a crucial component of autoregressive transformer-based image generation. The tokens are typically associated with spatial locations in the input image, arranged in raster scan order, which is not ideal for autoregressive modeling. In this paper, we propose to tokenize the image spectrum instead, obtained from a discrete wavelet transform (DWT), such that the sequence of tokens represents the image in a coarse-to-fine fashion. Our tokenizer brings several advantages: 1) it leverages that natural images are more compressible at high frequencies, 2) it can take and reconstruct images of different resolutions without retraining, 3) it improves the conditioning for next-token prediction -- instead of conditioning on a partial line-by-line reconstruction of the image, it takes a coarse reconstruction of the full image, 4) it enables partial decoding where the first few generated tokens can reconstruct a coarse version of the image, 5) it enables autoregressive models to be used for image upsampling. We evaluate the tokenizer reconstruction metrics as well as multiscale image generation, text-guided image upsampling and editing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Canonical Latent Representations in Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09955v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conditional diffusion models (CDMs) have shown impressive performance across a range of generative tasks. Their ability to model the full data distribution has opened new avenues for analysis-by-synthesis in downstream discriminative learning. However, this same modeling capacity causes CDMs to entangle the class-defining features with irrelevant context, posing challenges to extracting robust and interpretable representations. To this end, we identify Canonical LAtent Representations (CLAReps), latent codes whose internal CDM features preserve essential categorical information while discarding non-discriminative signals. When decoded, CLAReps produce representative samples for each class, offering an interpretable and compact summary of the core class semantics with minimal irrelevant details. Exploiting CLAReps, we develop a novel diffusion-based feature-distillation paradigm, CaDistill. While the student has full access to the training set, the CDM as teacher transfers core class knowledge only via CLAReps, which amounts to merely 10 % of the training data in size. After training, the student achieves strong adversarial robustness and generalization ability, focusing more on the class signals instead of spurious background cues. Our findings suggest that CDMs can serve not just as image generators but also as compact, interpretable teachers that can drive robust representation learning.</p></details> | 45 pages,41 figures |
| **[HadaNorm: Diffusion Transformer Quantization through Mean-Centered Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09932v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models represent the cutting edge in image generation, but their high memory and computational demands hinder deployment on resource-constrained devices. Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches and effectively mitigates outliers by normalizing activations feature channels before applying Hadamard transformations, enabling more aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, achieving superior efficiency-performance trade-offs when compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 4 Pages, 5 Figures |

State-of-the-art methods aiming for style-consistent generation struggle to effectively separate semantic content from stylistic elements, leading to content leakage from the image provided as a reference to the targets. To address this challenge, we propose Only-Style: a method designed to mitigate content leakage in a semantically coherent manner while preserving stylistic consistency. Only-Style works by localizing content leakage during inference, allowing the adaptive tuning of a parameter that controls the style alignment process, specifically within the image patches containing the subject in the reference image. This adaptive process best balances stylistic consistency with leakage elimination. Moreover, the localization of content leakage can function as a standalone component, given a reference-target image pair, allowing the adaptive tuning of any method-specific parameter that provides control over the impact of the stylistic reference. In addition, we propose a novel evaluation framework to quantify the success of style-consistent generations in avoiding undesired content leakage. Our approach demonstrates a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods through extensive evaluation across diverse instances, consistently achieving robust stylistic consistency without undesired content leakage.</p></details> |  |

In this report, we present ContentV, an 8B-parameter text-to-video model that achieves state-of-the-art performance (85.14 on VBench) after training on 256 x 64GB Neural Processing Units (NPUs) for merely four weeks. ContentV generates diverse, high-quality videos across multiple resolutions and durations from text prompts, enabled by three key innovations: (1) A minimalist architecture that maximizes reuse of pre-trained image generation models for video generation; (2) A systematic multi-stage training strategy leveraging flow matching for enhanced efficiency; and (3) A cost-effective reinforcement learning with human feedback framework that improves generation quality without requiring additional human annotations.

| **[Unseen Visual Anomaly Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01078v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection (AD) presents significant challenges due to the scarcity of anomalous data samples. While numerous works have been proposed to synthesize anomalous samples, these synthetic anomalies often lack authenticity or require extensive training data, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose Anomaly Anything (AnomalyAny), a novel framework that leverages Stable Diffusion (SD)'s image generation capabilities to generate diverse and realistic unseen anomalies. By conditioning on a single normal sample during test time, AnomalyAny is able to generate unseen anomalies for arbitrary object types with text descriptions. Within AnomalyAny, we propose attention-guided anomaly optimization to direct SD attention on generating hard anomaly concepts. Additionally, we introduce prompt-guided anomaly refinement, incorporating detailed descriptions to further improve the generation quality. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA datasets demonstrate AnomalyAny's ability in generating high-quality unseen anomalies and its effectiveness in enhancing downstream AD performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages excluding supplementary</p></details> |
| **[DANCE: Deep Learning-Assisted Analysis of Protein Sequences Using Chaos Enhanced Kaleidoscopic Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06694v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell growth. T cell receptors (TCRs), crucial proteins in the immune system, play a key role in recognizing antigens, including those associated with cancer. Recent advancements in sequencing technologies have facilitated comprehensive profiling of TCR repertoires, uncovering TCRs with potent anti-cancer activity and enabling TCR-based immunotherapies. However, analyzing these intricate biomolecules necessitates efficient representations that capture their structural and functional information. T-cell protein sequences pose unique challenges due to their relatively smaller lengths compared to other biomolecules. An image-based representation approach becomes a preferred choice for efficient embeddings, allowing for the preservation of essential details and enabling comprehensive analysis of T-cell protein sequences. In this paper, we propose to generate images from the protein sequences using the idea of Chaos Game Representation (CGR) using the Kaleidoscopic images approach. This Deep Learning Assisted Analysis of Protein Sequences Using Chaos Enhanced Kaleidoscopic Images (called DANCE) provides a unique way to visualize protein sequences by recursively applying chaos game rules around a central seed point. we perform the classification of the T cell receptors (TCRs) protein sequences in terms of their respective target cancer cells, as TCRs are known for their immune response against cancer disease. The TCR sequences are converted into images using the DANCE method. We employ deep-learning vision models to perform the classification to obtain insights into the relationship between the visual patterns observed in the generated kaleidoscopic images and the underlying protein properties. By combining CGR-based image generation with deep learning classification, this study opens novel possibilities in the protein analysis domain.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have shown that these models not only generate high-quality images but also encode text-image alignment information through attention maps or loss functions. This information is valuable for various downstream tasks, including segmentation, text-guided image editing, and compositional image generation. However, current methods heavily rely on the assumption of perfect text-image alignment in diffusion models, which is not the case. In this paper, we propose using zero-shot referring image segmentation as a proxy task to evaluate the pixel-level image and class-level text alignment of popular diffusion models. We conduct an in-depth analysis of pixel-text misalignment in diffusion models from the perspective of training data bias. We find that misalignment occurs in images with small sized, occluded, or rare object classes. Therefore, we propose ELBO-T2IAlign, a simple yet effective method to calibrate pixel-text alignment in diffusion models based on the evidence lower bound (ELBO) of likelihood. Our method is training-free and generic, eliminating the need to identify the specific cause of misalignment and works well across various diffusion model architectures. Extensive experiments on commonly used benchmark datasets on image segmentation and generation have verified the effectiveness of our proposed calibration approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGAE: Diffusion-Guided Autoencoder for Efficient Latent Representation Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09644v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoencoders empower state-of-the-art image and video generative models by compressing pixels into a latent space through visual tokenization. Although recent advances have alleviated the performance degradation of autoencoders under high compression ratios, addressing the training instability caused by GAN remains an open challenge. While improving spatial compression, we also aim to minimize the latent space dimensionality, enabling more efficient and compact representations. To tackle these challenges, we focus on improving the decoder's expressiveness. Concretely, we propose DGAE, which employs a diffusion model to guide the decoder in recovering informative signals that are not fully decoded from the latent representation. With this design, DGAE effectively mitigates the performance degradation under high spatial compression rates. At the same time, DGAE achieves state-of-the-art performance with a 2x smaller latent space. When integrated with Diffusion Models, DGAE demonstrates competitive performance on image generation for ImageNet-1K and shows that this compact latent representation facilitates faster convergence of the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Story Generation with Asymmetry Zigzag Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09612v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation models have made significant progress in producing high-quality images from textual descriptions, yet they continue to struggle with maintaining subject consistency across multiple images, a fundamental requirement for visual storytelling. Existing methods attempt to address this by either fine-tuning models on large-scale story visualization datasets, which is resource-intensive, or by using training-free techniques that share information across generations, which still yield limited success. In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free sampling strategy called Zigzag Sampling with Asymmetric Prompts and Visual Sharing to enhance subject consistency in visual story generation. Our approach proposes a zigzag sampling mechanism that alternates between asymmetric prompting to retain subject characteristics, while a visual sharing module transfers visual cues across generated images to %further enforce consistency. Experimental results, based on both quantitative metrics and qualitative evaluations, demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous approaches in generating coherent and consistent visual stories. The code is available at https://github.com/Mingxiao-Li/Asymmetry-Zigzag-StoryDiffusion.</p></details> | 17 pages, 9. figures |
| **[Marrying Autoregressive Transformer and Diffusion with Multi-Reference Autoregression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09482v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce TransDiff, the first image generation model that marries Autoregressive (AR) Transformer with diffusion models. In this joint modeling framework, TransDiff encodes labels and images into high-level semantic features and employs a diffusion model to estimate the distribution of image samples. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, TransDiff significantly outperforms other image generation models based on standalone AR Transformer or diffusion models. Specifically, TransDiff achieves a Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) of 1.61 and an Inception Score (IS) of 293.4, and further provides x2 faster inference latency compared to state-of-the-art methods based on AR Transformer and x112 faster inference compared to diffusion-only models. Furthermore, building on the TransDiff model, we introduce a novel image generation paradigm called Multi-Reference Autoregression (MRAR), which performs autoregressive generation by predicting the next image. MRAR enables the model to reference multiple previously generated images, thereby facilitating the learning of more diverse representations and improving the quality of generated images in subsequent iterations. By applying MRAR, the performance of TransDiff is improved, with the FID reduced from 1.61 to 1.42. We expect TransDiff to open up a new frontier in the field of image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09416v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Noise Conditional Variational Score Distillation (NCVSD), a novel method for distilling pretrained diffusion models into generative denoisers. We achieve this by revealing that the unconditional score function implicitly characterizes the score function of denoising posterior distributions. By integrating this insight into the Variational Score Distillation (VSD) framework, we enable scalable learning of generative denoisers capable of approximating samples from the denoising posterior distribution across a wide range of noise levels. The proposed generative denoisers exhibit desirable properties that allow fast generation while preserve the benefit of iterative refinement: (1) fast one-step generation through sampling from pure Gaussian noise at high noise levels; (2) improved sample quality by scaling the test-time compute with multi-step sampling; and (3) zero-shot probabilistic inference for flexible and controllable sampling. We evaluate NCVSD through extensive experiments, including class-conditional image generation and inverse problem solving. By scaling the test-time compute, our method outperforms teacher diffusion models and is on par with consistency models of larger sizes. Additionally, with significantly fewer NFEs than diffusion-based methods, we achieve record-breaking LPIPS on inverse problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SkipVAR: Accelerating Visual Autoregressive Modeling via Adaptive Frequency-Aware Skipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08908v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies on Visual Autoregressive (VAR) models have highlighted that high-frequency components, or later steps, in the generation process contribute disproportionately to inference latency. However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/fakerone-li/SkipVAR and has been publicly released.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGE: Exploring the Boundaries of Unsafe Concept Domain with Semantic-Augment Erasing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09363v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have achieved significant progress in text-to-image generation. However, the inevitable inclusion of sensitive information during pre-training poses safety risks, such as unsafe content generation and copyright infringement. Concept erasing finetunes weights to unlearn undesirable concepts, and has emerged as a promising solution. However, existing methods treat unsafe concept as a fixed word and repeatedly erase it, trapping DMs in ``word concept abyss'', which prevents generalized concept-related erasing. To escape this abyss, we introduce semantic-augment erasing which transforms concept word erasure into concept domain erasure by the cyclic self-check and self-erasure. It efficiently explores and unlearns the boundary representation of concept domain through semantic spatial relationships between original and training DMs, without requiring additional preprocessed data. Meanwhile, to mitigate the retention degradation of irrelevant concepts while erasing unsafe concepts, we further propose the global-local collaborative retention mechanism that combines global semantic relationship alignment with local predicted noise preservation, effectively expanding the retentive receptive field for irrelevant concepts. We name our method SAGE, and extensive experiments demonstrate the comprehensive superiority of SAGE compared with other methods in the safe generation of DMs. The code and weights will be open-sourced at https://github.com/KevinLight831/SAGE.</p></details> | Under review |

Ming-Omni employs dedicated encoders to extract tokens from different modalities, which are then processed by Ling, an MoE architecture equipped with newly proposed modality-specific routers. This design enables a single model to efficiently process and fuse multimodal inputs within a unified framework, thereby facilitating diverse tasks without requiring separate models, task-specific fine-tuning, or structural redesign. Importantly, Ming-Omni extends beyond conventional multimodal models by supporting audio and image generation. This is achieved through the integration of an advanced audio decoder for natural-sounding speech and Ming-Lite-Uni for high-quality image generation, which also allow the model to engage in context-aware chatting, perform text-to-speech conversion, and conduct versatile image editing. Our experimental results showcase Ming-Omni offers a powerful solution for unified perception and generation across all modalities. Notably, our proposed Ming-Omni is the first open-source model we are aware of to match GPT-4o in modality support, and we release all code and model weights to encourage further research and development in the community.</p></details> | 18 pages,8 figures |
| **[Is Perturbation-Based Image Protection Disruptive to Image Editing?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04394v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable image generation capabilities of state-of-the-art diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can also be misused to spread misinformation and plagiarize copyrighted materials. To mitigate the potential risks associated with image editing, current image protection methods rely on adding imperceptible perturbations to images to obstruct diffusion-based editing. A fully successful protection for an image implies that the output of editing attempts is an undesirable, noisy image which is completely unrelated to the reference image. In our experiments with various perturbation-based image protection methods across multiple domains (natural scene images and artworks) and editing tasks (image-to-image generation and style editing), we discover that such protection does not achieve this goal completely. In most scenarios, diffusion-based editing of protected images generates a desirable output image which adheres precisely to the guidance prompt. Our findings suggest that adding noise to images may paradoxically increase their association with given text prompts during the generation process, leading to unintended consequences such as better resultant edits. Hence, we argue that perturbation-based methods may not provide a sufficient solution for robust image protection against diffusion-based editing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ICIP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffuse and Disperse: Image Generation with Representation Regularization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09027v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of diffusion-based generative models over the past decade has largely proceeded independently of progress in representation learning. These diffusion models typically rely on regression-based objectives and generally lack explicit regularization. In this work, we propose \textit{Dispersive Loss}, a simple plug-and-play regularizer that effectively improves diffusion-based generative models. Our loss function encourages internal representations to disperse in the hidden space, analogous to contrastive self-supervised learning, with the key distinction that it requires no positive sample pairs and therefore does not interfere with the sampling process used for regression. Compared to the recent method of representation alignment (REPA), our approach is self-contained and minimalist, requiring no pre-training, no additional parameters, and no external data. We evaluate Dispersive Loss on the ImageNet dataset across a range of models and report consistent improvements over widely used and strong baselines. We hope our work will help bridge the gap between generative modeling and representation learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bias Analysis in Unconditional Image Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09106v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of generative AI models has raised growing concerns about representational harm and potential discriminatory outcomes. Yet, despite growing literature on this topic, the mechanisms by which bias emerges - especially in unconditional generation - remain disentangled. We define the bias of an attribute as the difference between the probability of its presence in the observed distribution and its expected proportion in an ideal reference distribution. In our analysis, we train a set of unconditional image generative models and adopt a commonly used bias evaluation framework to study bias shift between training and generated distributions. Our experiments reveal that the detected attribute shifts are small. We find that the attribute shifts are sensitive to the attribute classifier used to label generated images in the evaluation framework, particularly when its decision boundaries fall in high-density regions. Our empirical analysis indicates that this classifier sensitivity is often observed in attributes values that lie on a spectrum, as opposed to exhibiting a binary nature. This highlights the need for more representative labeling practices, understanding the shortcomings through greater scrutiny of evaluation frameworks, and recognizing the socially complex nature of attributes when evaluating bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[CulturalFrames: Assessing Cultural Expectation Alignment in Text-to-Image Models and Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08835v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit as well as implicit cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that T2I models not only fail to meet the more challenging implicit expectations but also the less challenging explicit expectations. Across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, providing actionable directions for developing more culturally informed T2I models and evaluation methodologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue, existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency 93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into RL for Image Generation with CoT: A Study on DPO vs. GRPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17017v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements underscore the significant role of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in enhancing the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Two prominent RL algorithms, Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), are central to these developments, showcasing different pros and cons. Autoregressive image generation, also interpretable as a sequential CoT reasoning process, presents unique challenges distinct from LLM-based CoT reasoning. These encompass ensuring text-image consistency, improving image aesthetic quality, and designing sophisticated reward models, rather than relying on simpler rule-based rewards. While recent efforts have extended RL to this domain, these explorations typically lack an in-depth analysis of the domain-specific challenges and the characteristics of different RL strategies. To bridge this gap, we provide the first comprehensive investigation of the GRPO and DPO algorithms in autoregressive image generation, evaluating their in-domain performance and out-of-domain generalization, while scrutinizing the impact of different reward models on their respective capabilities. Our findings reveal that GRPO and DPO exhibit distinct advantages, and crucially, that reward models possessing stronger intrinsic generalization capabilities potentially enhance the generalization potential of the applied RL algorithms. Furthermore, we systematically explore three prevalent scaling strategies to enhance both their in-domain and out-of-domain proficiency, deriving unique insights into efficiently scaling performance for each paradigm. We hope our study paves a new path for inspiring future work on developing more effective RL algorithms to achieve robust CoT reasoning in the realm of autoregressive image generation.

| **[Flow Diverse and Efficient: Learning Momentum Flow Matching via Stochastic Velocity Field Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08796v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the rectified flow (RF) has emerged as the new state-of-the-art among flow-based diffusion models due to its high efficiency advantage in straight path sampling, especially with the amazing images generated by a series of RF models such as Flux 1.0 and SD 3.0. Although a straight-line connection between the noisy and natural data distributions is intuitive, fast, and easy to optimize, it still inevitably leads to: 1) Diversity concerns, which arise since straight-line paths only cover a fairly restricted sampling space. 2) Multi-scale noise modeling concerns, since the straight line flow only needs to optimize the constant velocity field $\bm v$ between the two distributions $\bm\pi_0$ and $\bm\pi_1$. In this work, we present Discretized-RF, a new family of rectified flow (also called momentum flow models since they refer to the previous velocity component and the random velocity component in each diffusion step), which discretizes the straight path into a series of variable velocity field sub-paths (namely ``momentum fields'') to expand the search space, especially when close to the distribution $p_\text{noise}$. Different from the previous case where noise is directly superimposed on $\bm x$, we introduce noise on the velocity $\bm v$ of the sub-path to change its direction in order to improve the diversity and multi-scale noise modeling abilities. Experimental results on several representative datasets demonstrate that learning momentum flow matching by sampling random velocity fields will produce trajectories that are both diverse and efficient, and can consistently generate high-quality and diverse results.

| **[OneIG-Bench: Omni-dimensional Nuanced Evaluation for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07977v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) models have garnered significant attention for generating high-quality images aligned with text prompts. However, rapid T2I model advancements reveal limitations in early benchmarks, lacking comprehensive evaluations, for example, the evaluation on reasoning, text rendering and style. Notably, recent state-of-the-art models, with their rich knowledge modeling capabilities, show promising results on the image generation problems requiring strong reasoning ability, yet existing evaluation systems have not adequately addressed this frontier. To systematically address these gaps, we introduce OneIG-Bench, a meticulously designed comprehensive benchmark framework for fine-grained evaluation of T2I models across multiple dimensions, including prompt-image alignment, text rendering precision, reasoning-generated content, stylization, and diversity. By structuring the evaluation, this benchmark enables in-depth analysis of model performance, helping researchers and practitioners pinpoint strengths and bottlenecks in the full pipeline of image generation. Specifically, OneIG-Bench enables flexible evaluation by allowing users to focus on a particular evaluation subset. Instead of generating images for the entire set of prompts, users can generate images only for the prompts associated with the selected dimension and complete the corresponding evaluation accordingly. Our codebase and dataset are now publicly available to facilitate reproducible evaluation studies and cross-model comparisons within the T2I research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAMBO: High-Resolution Generative Approach for Mammography Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08677v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mammography is the gold standard for the detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. This procedure can be significantly enhanced with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based software, which assists radiologists in identifying abnormalities. However, training AI systems requires large and diverse datasets, which are often difficult to obtain due to privacy and ethical constraints. To address this issue, the paper introduces MAMmography ensemBle mOdel (MAMBO), a novel patch-based diffusion approach designed to generate full-resolution mammograms. Diffusion models have shown breakthrough results in realistic image generation, yet few studies have focused on mammograms, and none have successfully generated high-resolution outputs required to capture fine-grained features of small lesions. To achieve this, MAMBO integrates separate diffusion models to capture both local and global (image-level) contexts. The contextual information is then fed into the final patch-based model, significantly aiding the noise removal process. This thoughtful design enables MAMBO to generate highly realistic mammograms of up to 3840x3840 pixels. Importantly, this approach can be used to enhance the training of classification models and extended to anomaly detection. Experiments, both numerical and radiologist validation, assess MAMBO's capabilities in image generation, super-resolution, and anomaly detection, highlighting its potential to enhance mammography analysis for more accurate diagnoses and earlier lesion detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 14 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Re-Thinking the Automatic Evaluation of Image-Text Alignment in Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08480v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models often struggle to generate images that precisely match textual prompts. Prior research has extensively studied the evaluation of image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, existing evaluations primarily focus on agreement with human assessments, neglecting other critical properties of a trustworthy evaluation framework. In this work, we first identify two key aspects that a reliable evaluation should address. We then empirically demonstrate that current mainstream evaluation frameworks fail to fully satisfy these properties across a diverse range of metrics and models. Finally, we propose recommendations for improving image-text alignment evaluation.</p></details> |  |

We present SakugaFlow, a four-stage pipeline that pairs diffusion-based image generation with a large-language-model tutor. At each stage, novices receive real-time feedback on anatomy, perspective, and composition, revise any step non-linearly, and branch alternative versions. By exposing intermediate outputs and embedding pedagogical dialogue, SakugaFlow turns a black-box generator into a scaffolded learning environment that supports both creative exploration and skills acquisition.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure; accepted as a paper to the Generative AI and HCI (GenAICHI) workshop at CHI 2025 (Yokohama, 27 Apr 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Image Demoiréing Using Dual Camera Fusion on Mobile Phones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08361v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When shooting electronic screens, moir\'e patterns usually appear in captured images, which seriously affects the image quality. Existing image demoir\'eing methods face great challenges in removing large and heavy moir\'e. To address the issue, we propose to utilize Dual Camera fusion for Image Demoir\'eing (DCID), \ie, using the ultra-wide-angle (UW) image to assist the moir\'e removal of wide-angle (W) image. This is inspired by two motivations: (1) the two lenses are commonly equipped with modern smartphones, (2) the UW image generally can provide normal colors and textures when moir\'e exists in the W image mainly due to their different focal lengths. In particular, we propose an efficient DCID method, where a lightweight UW image encoder is integrated into an existing demoir\'eing network and a fast two-stage image alignment manner is present. Moreover, we construct a large-scale real-world dataset with diverse mobile phones and monitors, containing about 9,000 samples. Experiments on the dataset show our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Mrduckk/DCID.</p></details> | ICME 2025 |
| **[SnapGen-V: Generating a Five-Second Video within Five Seconds on a Mobile Device](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10494v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We have witnessed the unprecedented success of diffusion-based video generation over the past year. Recently proposed models from the community have wielded the power to generate cinematic and high-resolution videos with smooth motions from arbitrary input prompts. However, as a supertask of image generation, video generation models require more computation and are thus hosted mostly on cloud servers, limiting broader adoption among content creators. In this work, we propose a comprehensive acceleration framework to bring the power of the large-scale video diffusion model to the hands of edge users. From the network architecture scope, we initialize from a compact image backbone and search out the design and arrangement of temporal layers to maximize hardware efficiency. In addition, we propose a dedicated adversarial fine-tuning algorithm for our efficient model and reduce the denoising steps to 4. Our model, with only 0.6B parameters, can generate a 5-second video on an iPhone 16 PM within 5 seconds. Compared to server-side models that take minutes on powerful GPUs to generate a single video, we accelerate the generation by magnitudes while delivering on-par quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://snap-research.github.io/snapgen-v/</p></details> |
| **[Highly Compressed Tokenizer Can Generate Without Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08257v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commonly used image tokenizers produce a 2D grid of spatially arranged tokens. In contrast, so-called 1D image tokenizers represent images as highly compressed one-dimensional sequences of as few as 32 discrete tokens. We find that the high degree of compression achieved by a 1D tokenizer with vector quantization enables image editing and generative capabilities through heuristic manipulation of tokens, demonstrating that even very crude manipulations -- such as copying and replacing tokens between latent representations of images -- enable fine-grained image editing by transferring appearance and semantic attributes. Motivated by the expressivity of the 1D tokenizer's latent space, we construct an image generation pipeline leveraging gradient-based test-time optimization of tokens with plug-and-play loss functions such as reconstruction or CLIP similarity. Our approach is demonstrated for inpainting and text-guided image editing use cases, and can generate diverse and realistic samples without requiring training of any generative model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main ...</summary><p>Main manuscript: 9 pages, 7 figures.
