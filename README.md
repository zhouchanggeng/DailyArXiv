| **[Rethinking Few Shot CLIP Benchmarks: A Critical Analysis in the Inductive Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20834v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new benchmarks, and provide an improved method.</p></details> |  |
| **[AF-CLIP: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection via Anomaly-Focused CLIP Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19949v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task, they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies, reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context. Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method.

| **[Text-to-Image Generation Via Energy-Based CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17046v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint Energy Models (JEMs), while drawing significant research attention, have not been successfully scaled to real-world, high-resolution datasets. We present CLIP-JEM, a novel approach extending JEMs to the multimodal vision-language domain using CLIP, integrating both generative and discriminative objectives. For the generative one, we introduce an image-text joint-energy function based on Cosine similarity in the CLIP space, training CLIP to assign low energy to real image-caption pairs and high energy otherwise. For the discriminative one, we employ contrastive adversarial loss, extending the adversarial training objective to the multimodal domain. CLIP-JEM not only generates realistic images from text but also achieves competitive results on the compositionality benchmark, outperforming leading methods with fewer parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior guidance capability of CLIP-JEM by enhancing CLIP-based generative frameworks and converting unconditional diffusion models to text-based ones. Lastly, we show that our model can serve as a more robust evaluation metric for text-to-image generative tasks than CLIP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[CLIP-Guided Backdoor Defense through Entropy-Based Poisoned Dataset Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05113v2)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model. Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense scenarios.

| **[External Knowledge Injection for CLIP-Based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08510v2)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) enables learning systems to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. With the advancement of pre-training, leveraging pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) offers a promising starting point for CIL. However, CLIP makes decisions by matching visual embeddings to class names, overlooking the rich contextual information conveyed through language. For instance, the concept of ``cat'' can be decomposed into features like tail, fur, and face for recognition. Besides, since the model is continually updated, these detailed features are overwritten in CIL, requiring external knowledge for compensation. In this paper, we introduce ExterNal knowledGe INjEction (ENGINE) for CLIP-based CIL. To enhance knowledge transfer from outside the dataset, we propose a dual-branch injection tuning framework that encodes informative knowledge from both visual and textual modalities. The visual branch is enhanced with data augmentation to enrich the visual features, while the textual branch leverages GPT-4 to rewrite discriminative descriptors. In addition to this on-the-fly knowledge injection, we also implement post-tuning knowledge by re-ranking the prediction results during inference. With the injected knowledge, the model can better capture informative features for downstream tasks as data evolves. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of ENGINE.

| **[Advancing Vision-based Human Action Recognition: Exploring Vision-Language CLIP Model for Generalisation in Domain-Independent Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18675v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine, supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection, surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across domain-independent healthcare scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[FishDet-M: A Unified Large-Scale Benchmark for Robust Fish Detection and CLIP-Guided Model Selection in Diverse Aquatic Visual Domains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17859v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate fish detection in underwater imagery is essential for ecological monitoring, aquaculture automation, and robotic perception. However, practical deployment remains limited by fragmented datasets, heterogeneous imaging conditions, and inconsistent evaluation protocols. To address these gaps, we present \textit{FishDet-M}, the largest unified benchmark for fish detection, comprising 13 publicly available datasets spanning diverse aquatic environments including marine, brackish, occluded, and aquarium scenes. All data are harmonized using COCO-style annotations with both bounding boxes and segmentation masks, enabling consistent and scalable cross-domain evaluation. We systematically benchmark 28 contemporary object detection models, covering the YOLOv8 to YOLOv12 series, R-CNN based detectors, and DETR based models. Evaluations are conducted using standard metrics including mAP, mAP@50, and mAP@75, along with scale-specific analyses (AP$_S$, AP$_M$, AP$_L$) and inference profiling in terms of latency and parameter count. The results highlight the varying detection performance across models trained on FishDet-M, as well as the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency across models of different architectures. To support adaptive deployment, we introduce a CLIP-based model selection framework that leverages vision-language alignment to dynamically identify the most semantically appropriate detector for each input image. This zero-shot selection strategy achieves high performance without requiring ensemble computation, offering a scalable solution for real-time applications. FishDet-M establishes a standardized and reproducible platform for evaluating object detection in complex aquatic scenes. All datasets, pretrained models, and evaluation tools are publicly available to facilitate future research in underwater computer vision and intelligent marine systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaskedCLIP: Bridging the Masked and CLIP Space for Semi-Supervised Medical Vision-Language Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17239v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have recently gained tremendous popularity in medical image analysis. State-of-the-art methods leverage either paired image-text data via vision-language pre-training or unpaired image data via self-supervised pre-training to learn foundation models with generalizable image features to boost downstream task performance. However, learning foundation models exclusively on either paired or unpaired image data limits their ability to learn richer and more comprehensive image features. In this paper, we investigate a novel task termed semi-supervised vision-language pre-training, aiming to fully harness the potential of both paired and unpaired image data for foundation model learning. To this end, we propose MaskedCLIP, a synergistic masked image modeling and contrastive language-image pre-training framework for semi-supervised vision-language pre-training. The key challenge in combining paired and unpaired image data for learning a foundation model lies in the incompatible feature spaces derived from these two types of data. To address this issue, we propose to connect the masked feature space with the CLIP feature space with a bridge transformer. In this way, the more semantic specific CLIP features can benefit from the more general masked features for semantic feature extraction. We further propose a masked knowledge distillation loss to distill semantic knowledge of original image features in CLIP feature space back to the predicted masked image features in masked feature space. With this mutually interactive design, our framework effectively leverages both paired and unpaired image data to learn more generalizable image features for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on retinal image analysis demonstrate the effectiveness and data efficiency of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MedAGI 2025 (Oral)</p></details> |
| **[VL-CLIP: Enhancing Multimodal Recommendations via Visual Grounding and LLM-Augmented CLIP Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17080v1)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning plays a critical role in e-commerce recommendation platforms today, enabling accurate recommendations and product understanding. However, existing vision-language models, such as CLIP, face key challenges in e-commerce recommendation systems: 1) Weak object-level alignment, where global image embeddings fail to capture fine-grained product attributes, leading to suboptimal retrieval performance; 2) Ambiguous textual representations, where product descriptions often lack contextual clarity, affecting cross-modal matching; and 3) Domain mismatch, as generic vision-language models may not generalize well to e-commerce-specific data. To address these limitations, we propose a framework, VL-CLIP, that enhances CLIP embeddings by integrating Visual Grounding for fine-grained visual understanding and an LLM-based agent for generating enriched text embeddings. Visual Grounding refines image representations by localizing key products, while the LLM agent enhances textual features by disambiguating product descriptions. Our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy, multimodal retrieval effectiveness, and recommendation quality across tens of millions of items on one of the largest e-commerce platforms in the U.S., increasing CTR by 18.6%, ATC by 15.5%, and GMV by 4.0%. Additional experimental results show that our framework outperforms vision-language models, including CLIP, FashionCLIP, and GCL, in both precision and semantic alignment, demonstrating the potential of combining object-aware visual grounding and LLM-enhanced text representation for robust multimodal recommendations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RecSys 2025; DOI:https://doi.org/10.1145/3705328.3748064</p></details> |
| **[Exploring How Generative MLLMs Perceive More Than CLIP with the Same Vision Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05195v3)** | 2025-07-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has shown that CLIP models struggle with visual reasoning tasks that require grounding compositionality, understanding spatial relationships, or capturing fine-grained details. One natural hypothesis is that the CLIP vision encoder does not embed essential information for these tasks. However, we find that this is not always the case: The encoder gathers query-relevant visual information, while CLIP fails to extract it. In particular, we show that another branch of Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), achieve significantly higher accuracy than CLIP in many of these tasks using the same vision encoder and weights, indicating that these Generative MLLMs perceive more -- as they extract and utilize visual information more effectively. We conduct a series of controlled experiments and reveal that their success is attributed to multiple key design choices, including patch tokens, position embeddings, and prompt-based weighting. On the other hand, enhancing the training data alone or applying a stronger text encoder does not suffice to solve the task, and additional text tokens offer little benefit. Interestingly, we find that fine-grained visual reasoning is not exclusive to generative models trained by an autoregressive loss: When converted into CLIP-like encoders by contrastive finetuning, these MLLMs still outperform CLIP under the same cosine similarity-based evaluation protocol. Our study highlights the importance of VLM architectural choices and suggests directions for improving the performance of CLIP-like contrastive VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025; 19 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[TriCLIP-3D: A Unified Parameter-Efficient Framework for Tri-Modal 3D Visual Grounding based on CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14904v1)** | 2025-07-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Brain Tumor Segmentation Method Based on CLIP and 3D U-Net with Cross-Modal Semantic Guidance and Multi-Level Feature Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09966v2)** | 2025-07-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Despite advances in deep learning methods, automatic segmentation remains challenging due to tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. Current techniques primarily rely on visual features extracted from MRI sequences while underutilizing semantic knowledge embedded in medical reports. This research presents a multi-level fusion architecture that integrates pixel-level, feature-level, and semantic-level information, facilitating comprehensive processing from low-level data to high-level concepts. The semantic-level fusion pathway combines the semantic understanding capabilities of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models with the spatial feature extraction advantages of 3D U-Net through three mechanisms: 3D-2D semantic bridging, cross-modal semantic guidance, and semantic-based attention mechanisms. Experimental validation on the BraTS 2020 dataset demonstrates that the proposed model achieves an overall Dice coefficient of 0.8567, representing a 4.8% improvement compared to traditional 3D U-Net, with a 7.3% Dice coefficient increase in the clinically important enhancing tumor (ET) region.</p></details> | 13 pages,6 figures |
| **[CultureCLIP: Empowering CLIP with Cultural Awareness through Synthetic Images and Contextualized Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06210v2)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in general multimodal comprehension but often struggle to capture nuanced, context-dependent visual cues. This makes it difficult to distinguish between similar-looking concepts with potentially different cultural meanings. Such deficiencies are mainly due to a limited amount of high-quality cultural data, contextual information, and the lack of negative examples that highlight subtle differences. To mitigate this, we design a data curation pipeline leveraging open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but are culturally different. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to develop CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through tailored contrastive learning. Experiments on culture-specific benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.</p></details> | 25 pages, COLM 2025 |
| **[Adapting OpenAI's CLIP Model for Few-Shot Image Inspection in Manufacturing Quality Control: An Expository Case Study with Multiple Application Examples](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12596v2)** | 2025-07-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This expository paper introduces a simplified approach to image-based quality inspection in manufacturing using OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model adapted for few-shot learning. While CLIP has demonstrated impressive capabilities in general computer vision tasks, its direct application to manufacturing inspection presents challenges due to the domain gap between its training data and industrial applications. We evaluate CLIP's effectiveness through five case studies: metallic pan surface inspection, 3D printing extrusion profile analysis, stochastic textured surface evaluation, automotive assembly inspection, and microstructure image classification. Our results show that CLIP can achieve high classification accuracy with relatively small learning sets (50-100 examples per class) for single-component and texture-based applications. However, the performance degrades with complex multi-component scenes. We provide a practical implementation framework that enables quality engineers to quickly assess CLIP's suitability for their specific applications before pursuing more complex solutions. This work establishes CLIP-based few-shot learning as an effective baseline approach that balances implementation simplicity with robust performance, demonstrated in several manufacturing quality control applications.</p></details> | 36 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Towards Fine-Grained Adaptation of CLIP via a Self-Trained Alignment Score](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09615v1)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP excel in zero-shot learning by aligning image and text representations through contrastive pretraining. Existing approaches to unsupervised adaptation (UA) for fine-grained classification with VLMs either rely on fixed alignment scores that cannot capture evolving, subtle class distinctions or use computationally expensive pseudo-labeling strategies that limit scalability. In contrast, we show that modeling fine-grained cross-modal interactions during adaptation produces more accurate, class-discriminative pseudo-labels and substantially improves performance over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. We introduce Fine-grained Alignment and Interaction Refinement (FAIR), an innovative approach that dynamically aligns localized image features with descriptive language embeddings through a set of Class Description Anchors (CDA). This enables the definition of a Learned Alignment Score (LAS), which incorporates CDA as an adaptive classifier, facilitating cross-modal interactions to improve self-training in unsupervised adaptation. Furthermore, we propose a self-training weighting mechanism designed to refine pseudo-labels in the presence of inter-class ambiguities. Our approach, FAIR, delivers a substantial performance boost in fine-grained unsupervised adaptation, achieving a notable overall gain of 2.78% across 13 fine-grained datasets compared to SOTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Patch Correlations in CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v2)** | 2025-07-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks.

| **[Mind the Gap: Preserving and Compensating for the Modality Gap in CLIP-Based Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09118v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning aims to enable models to learn sequentially from continuously incoming data while retaining performance on previously learned tasks. With the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-trained model (CLIP) exhibiting strong capabilities across various downstream tasks, there has been growing interest in leveraging CLIP for continual learning in such scenarios. Most existing works overlook the inherent modality gap in CLIP, a key factor in its generalization and adaptability. In this paper, we analyze the variations in the modality gap during the fine-tuning of vision-language pre-trained models. Our observations reveal that the modality gap effectively reflects the extent to which pre-trained knowledge is preserved. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective method, MG-CLIP, that improves CLIP's performance in class-incremental learning. Our approach leverages modality gap preservation to mitigate forgetting and modality gap compensation to enhance the capacity for new data, introducing a novel modality-gap-based perspective for continual learning. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches without requiring additional replay data.

| **[CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect binding.</p></details> |  |

Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5% in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for Optical OFDM Systems with Clipping Distortion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07507v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) have emerged as powerful techniques to enhance the performance of optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. While PCS improves spectral efficiency and adaptability, we show that its integration with optical OFDM can inadvertently increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal, exacerbating clipping distortion due to signal clipping. This letter investigates the impact of PCS on the PAPR of direct current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) waveforms and proposes an optimization of PCS that maximizes channel capacity, considering clipping distortion. The optimization problem is shown to be complex and non-convex. We thus present a suboptimal yet efficient solving approach based on projected gradient descent to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional uniform signaling, particularly under severe clipping distortion conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label-Efficient Chest X-ray Diagnosis via Partial CLIP Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07254v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not been peer reviewed yet.

| **[From Gradient Clipping to Normalization for Heavy Tailed SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13849v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent empirical evidence indicates that many machine learning applications involve heavy-tailed gradient noise, which challenges the standard assumptions of bounded variance in stochastic optimization. Gradient clipping has emerged as a popular tool to handle this heavy-tailed noise, as it achieves good performance in this setting both theoretically and practically. However, our current theoretical understanding of non-convex gradient clipping has three main shortcomings. First, the theory hinges on large, increasing clipping thresholds, which are in stark contrast to the small constant clipping thresholds employed in practice. Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge of problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. Lastly, even with this knowledge, current sampling complexity upper bounds for the method are sub-optimal in nearly all parameters. To address these issues, we study convergence of Normalized SGD (NSGD). First, we establish a parameter-free sample complexity for NSGD of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. Furthermore, we prove tightness of this result, by providing a matching algorithm-specific lower bound. In the setting where all problem parameters are known, we show this complexity is improved to $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\right)$, matching the previously known lower bound for all first-order methods in all problem dependent parameters. Finally, we establish high-probability convergence of NSGD with a mild logarithmic dependence on the failure probability. Our work complements the studies of gradient clipping under heavy tailed noise improving the sample complexities of existing algorithms and offering an alternative mechanism to achieve high probability convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed a typo, and removed the abuse of notation in the proof of Theorem 4</p></details> |

We propose a novel approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios without synthetic data or memory banks.

Due to the lack of ground-truth fused images, the fusion output of current deep-learning based methods heavily depends on the loss functions defined mathematically. As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we first propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors to represent the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

While previous approaches struggle with coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct, fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy. In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose AdaDPIGU--a new differentially private SGD framework with importance-based gradient updates tailored for deep neural networks. In the pretraining stage, we apply a differentially private Gaussian mechanism to estimate the importance of each parameter while preserving privacy. During the gradient update phase, we prune low-importance coordinates and introduce a coordinate-wise adaptive clipping mechanism, enabling sparse and noise-efficient gradient updates. Theoretically, we prove that AdaDPIGU satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and retains convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AdaDPIGU. All results are reported under a fixed retention ratio of 60%. On MNIST, our method achieves a test accuracy of 99.12% under a privacy budget of $\epsilon = 8$, nearly matching the non-private model. Remarkably, on CIFAR-10, it attains 73.21% accuracy at $\epsilon = 4$, outperforming the non-private baseline of 71.12%, demonstrating that adaptive sparsification can enhance both privacy and utility.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses two challenges in zero-reference LLIE: obtaining perceptually 'good' images using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model and maintaining computational efficiency for high-resolution images. We propose CLIP-Utilized Reinforcement learning-based Visual image Enhancement (CURVE). CURVE employs a simple image processing module which adjusts global image tone based on B\'ezier curve and estimates its processing parameters iteratively. The estimator is trained by reinforcement learning with rewards designed using CLIP text embeddings. Experiments on low-light and multi-exposure datasets demonstrate the performance of CURVE in terms of enhancement quality and processing speed compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | Accepted to ICIP2025 |

This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Surrogate to Fool Them All: Universal, Transferable, and Targeted Adversarial Attacks with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19840v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved widespread success yet remain prone to adversarial attacks. Typically, such attacks either involve frequent queries to the target model or rely on surrogate models closely mirroring the target model -- often trained with subsets of the target model's training data -- to achieve high attack success rates through transferability. However, in realistic scenarios where training data is inaccessible and excessive queries can raise alarms, crafting adversarial examples becomes more challenging. In this paper, we present UnivIntruder, a novel attack framework that relies solely on a single, publicly available CLIP model and publicly available datasets. By using textual concepts, UnivIntruder generates universal, transferable, and targeted adversarial perturbations that mislead DNNs into misclassifying inputs into adversary-specified classes defined by textual concepts. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of up to 85% on ImageNet and over 99% on CIFAR-10, significantly outperforming existing transfer-based methods. Additionally, we reveal real-world vulnerabilities, showing that even without querying target models, UnivIntruder compromises image search engines like Google and Baidu with ASR rates up to 84%, and vision language models like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 with ASR rates up to 80%. These findings underscore the practicality of our attack in scenarios where traditional avenues are blocked, highlighting the need to reevaluate security paradigms in AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 18 tables.

In this work, we introduce Flow Policy Optimization (FPO), a simple on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm that brings flow matching into the policy gradient framework. FPO casts policy optimization as maximizing an advantage-weighted ratio computed from the conditional flow matching loss, in a manner compatible with the popular PPO-clip framework. It sidesteps the need for exact likelihood computation while preserving the generative capabilities of flow-based models. Unlike prior approaches for diffusion-based reinforcement learning that bind training to a specific sampling method, FPO is agnostic to the choice of diffusion or flow integration at both training and inference time. We show that FPO can train diffusion-style policies from scratch in a variety of continuous control tasks. We find that flow-based models can capture multimodal action distributions and achieve higher performance than Gaussian policies, particularly in under-conditioned settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>See o...</summary><p>See our blog post: https://flowreinforce.github.io</p></details> |

However, the substantial computational costs associated with RL-based approaches have led to growing interest in alternative paradigms, such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of DPO in facilitating self-improvement for LLMs through iterative preference-based learning. We demonstrate that a single round of DPO with coarse filtering significantly enhances mathematical reasoning performance, particularly for strong base model. Furthermore, we design an iterative enhancement framework for both the generator and the reward model (RM), enabling their mutual improvement through online interaction across multiple rounds of DPO. Finally, with simple verifiable rewards, our model DPO-VP achieves RL-level performance with significantly lower computational overhead. These findings highlight DPO as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to RL, offering a practical solution for enhancing LLM reasoning in resource-constrained situations.</p></details> | 23pages |

While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) helps reduce cost, most existing approaches primarily address domain adaptation or layer-wise allocation rather than explicitly tailoring data and parameters to different response demands. Inspired by "Thinking, Fast and Slow," which characterizes two distinct modes of thought-System 1 (fast, intuitive, often automatic) and System 2 (slower, more deliberative and analytic)-we draw an analogy that different "subregions" of an LLM's parameters might similarly specialize for tasks that demand quick, intuitive responses versus those requiring multi-step logical reasoning. Therefore, we propose LoRA-PAR, a dual-system LoRA framework that partitions both data and parameters by System 1 or System 2 demands, using fewer yet more focused parameters for each task. Specifically, we classify task data via multi-model role-playing and voting, and partition parameters based on importance scoring, then adopt a two-stage fine-tuning strategy of training System 1 tasks with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to enhance knowledge and intuition and refine System 2 tasks with reinforcement learning (RL) to reinforce deeper logical deliberation next. Extensive experiments show that the two-stage fine-tuning strategy, SFT and RL, lowers active parameter usage while matching or surpassing SOTA PEFT baselines.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Current reinforcement learning approaches use binary rewards that treat elements as hit-or-miss targets, creating sparse signals that ignore the continuous nature of spatial interactions. Motivated by human clicking behavior that naturally forms Gaussian distributions centered on target elements, we introduce GUI Gaussian Grounding Rewards (GUI-G$^2$), a principled reward framework that models GUI elements as continuous Gaussian distributions across the interface plane. GUI-G$^2$ incorporates two synergistic mechanisms: Gaussian point rewards model precise localization through exponentially decaying distributions centered on element centroids, while coverage rewards assess spatial alignment by measuring the overlap between predicted Gaussian distributions and target regions. To handle diverse element scales, we develop an adaptive variance mechanism that calibrates reward distributions based on element dimensions. This framework transforms GUI grounding from sparse binary classification to dense continuous optimization, where Gaussian distributions generate rich gradient signals that guide models toward optimal interaction positions. Extensive experiments across ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2, and ScreenSpot-Pro benchmarks demonstrate that GUI-G$^2$, substantially outperforms state-of-the-art method UI-TARS-72B, with the most significant improvement of 24.7% on ScreenSpot-Pro. Our analysis reveals that continuous modeling provides superior robustness to interface variations and enhanced generalization to unseen layouts, establishing a new paradigm for spatial reasoning in GUI interaction tasks.</p></details> |  |

Such updates are typically performed through handoff (HO) operations; however, frequent HOs lead to overheads associated with the allocation and release of resources. This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to predict and manage these connections for mobile users. Our solution employs the Soft Actor-Critic algorithm, with continuous action space representation, to train a deep neural network to serve as the HO policy. We present a novel proposition for a reward function that integrates a HO penalty in order to balance the attainable rate and the associated overhead related to HOs. We develop two variants of our system; the first one uses mobility direction-assisted (DA) observations that are based on the user movement pattern, while the second one uses history-assisted (HA) observations that are based on the history of the large-scale fading (LSF). Simulation results show that our DRL-based continuous action space approach is more scalable than discrete space counterpart, and that our derived HO policy automatically learns to gather HOs in specific time slots to minimize the overhead of initiating HOs. Our solution can also operate in real time with a response time less than 0.4 ms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Communications (IEEE TCOM)</p></details> |

However, current large multimodal models lack essential temporally-structured, detailed, and in-depth video comprehension capabilities, which are the cornerstone of effective video search and recommendation, as well as emerging video applications. Understanding real-world shorts is actually challenging due to their complex visual elements, high information density in both visuals and audio, and fast pacing that focuses on emotional expression and viewpoint delivery. This requires advanced reasoning to effectively integrate multimodal information, including visual, audio, and text. In this work, we introduce ARC-Hunyuan-Video, a multimodal model that processes visual, audio, and textual signals from raw video inputs end-to-end for structured comprehension. The model is capable of multi-granularity timestamped video captioning and summarization, open-ended video question answering, temporal video grounding, and video reasoning. Leveraging high-quality data from an automated annotation pipeline, our compact 7B-parameter model is trained through a comprehensive regimen: pre-training, instruction fine-tuning, cold start, reinforcement learning (RL) post-training, and final instruction fine-tuning. Quantitative evaluations on our introduced benchmark ShortVid-Bench and qualitative comparisons demonstrate its strong performance in real-world video comprehension, and it supports zero-shot or fine-tuning with a few samples for diverse downstream applications. The real-world production deployment of our model has yielded tangible and measurable improvements in user engagement and satisfaction, a success supported by its remarkable efficiency, with stress tests indicating an inference time of just 10 seconds for a one-minute video on H20 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://tencentarc.github.io/posts/arc-video-announcement/</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Leaning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15737v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for massive-scale systems consisting of large populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments has witnessed a significant surge in recent years across diverse scientific domains. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often results in high computational costs or compromised performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture along with the derivation of effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such a system as a parameterized control system defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform to map the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, which are organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. We further enhance the efficiency of the algorithm by exploiting early stopping at each hierarchy, which demonstrates the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the probabilistic reward task from the Establishing Moderators and Biosignatures of Antidepressant Response in Clinical Care (EMBARC) study, we propose a novel framework that integrates the reinforcement learning (RL) model and drift-diffusion model (DDM) to jointly analyze reward-based decision-making with response times. To account for emerging evidence suggesting that decision-making may alternate between multiple interleaved strategies, we model latent state switching using a hidden Markov model (HMM). In the ''engaged'' state, decisions follow an RL-DDM, simultaneously capturing reward processing, decision dynamics, and temporal structure. In contrast, in the ''lapsed'' state, decision-making is modeled using a simplified DDM, where specific parameters are fixed to approximate random guessing with equal probability. The proposed method is implemented using a computationally efficient generalized expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm with forward-backward procedures. Through extensive numerical studies, we demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms competing approaches across various reward-generating distributions, under both strategy-switching and non-switching scenarios, as well as in the presence of input perturbations. When applied to the EMBARC study, our framework reveals that MDD patients exhibit lower overall engagement than healthy controls and experience longer decision times when they do engage. Additionally, we show that neuroimaging measures of brain activities are associated with decision-making characteristics in the ''engaged'' state but not in the ''lapsed'' state, providing evidence of brain-behavior association specific to the ''engaged'' state.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DriveAgent-R1 to tackle these challenges in long-horizon, high-level behavioral decision-making. DriveAgent-R1 features two core innovations: a Hybrid-Thinking framework that adaptively switches between efficient text-based and in-depth tool-based reasoning, and an Active Perception mechanism with a vision toolkit to proactively resolve uncertainties, thereby balancing decision-making efficiency and reliability. The agent is trained using a novel, three-stage progressive reinforcement learning strategy designed to master these hybrid capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DriveAgent-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming even leading proprietary large multimodal models, such as Claude Sonnet 4. Ablation studies validate our approach and confirm that the agent's decisions are robustly grounded in actively perceived visual evidence, paving a path toward safer and more intelligent autonomous systems.</p></details> |  |

Despite these advances in practice, most theoretical work pertains to finite state and action spaces. We propose building a theoretical understanding of continuous state and action spaces by employing a geometric lens to understand the locally attained set of states. The set of all parametrised policies learnt through a semi-gradient based approach induces a set of attainable states in RL. We show that the training dynamics of a two-layer neural policy induce a low dimensional manifold of attainable states embedded in the high-dimensional nominal state space trained using an actor-critic algorithm. We prove that, under certain conditions, the dimensionality of this manifold is of the order of the dimensionality of the action space. This is the first result of its kind, linking the geometry of the state space to the dimensionality of the action space. We empirically corroborate this upper bound for four MuJoCo environments and also demonstrate the results in a toy environment with varying dimensionality. We also show the applicability of this theoretical result by introducing a local manifold learning layer to the policy and value function networks to improve the performance in control environments with very high degrees of freedom by changing one layer of the neural network to learn sparse representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the Thirteenth International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025). arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2301.00009</p></details> |

| **[Learning Only with Images: Visual Reinforcement Learning with Reasoning, Rendering, and Visual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20766v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have exhibited impressive performance across various visual tasks. Subsequent investigations into enhancing their visual reasoning abilities have significantly expanded their performance envelope. However, a critical bottleneck in the advancement of MLLMs toward deep visual reasoning is their heavy reliance on curated image-text supervision. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel framework termed ``Reasoning-Rendering-Visual-Feedback'' (RRVF), which enables MLLMs to learn complex visual reasoning from only raw images. This framework builds on the ``Asymmetry of Verification'' principle to train MLLMs, i.e., verifying the rendered output against a source image is easier than generating it. We demonstrate that this relative ease provides an ideal reward signal for optimization via Reinforcement Learning (RL) training, reducing the reliance on the image-text supervision. Guided by the above principle, RRVF implements a closed-loop iterative process encompassing reasoning, rendering, and visual feedback components, enabling the model to perform self-correction through multi-turn interactions and tool invocation, while this pipeline can be optimized by the GRPO algorithm in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on image-to-code generation for data charts and web interfaces show that RRVF substantially outperforms existing open-source MLLMs and surpasses supervised fine-tuning baselines. Our findings demonstrate that systems driven by purely visual feedback present a viable path toward more robust and generalizable reasoning models without requiring explicit supervision.

| **[Can Prompt Difficulty be Online Predicted for Accelerating RL Finetuning of Reasoning Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04632v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have witnessed the effectiveness of reinforcement learning (RL) finetuning in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The optimization process often requires numerous iterations to achieve satisfactory performance, resulting in high computational costs due to the need for frequent prompt evaluations under intensive LLM interactions and repeated policy updates. Appropriate online prompt selection methods reduce iteration steps by prioritizing informative prompts during training, while the pipeline's reliance on exhaustive prompt evaluation and subset selection for optimization still incurs substantial computational overhead due to frequent LLM inference calls. Distinguished from these direct evaluate-then-select schemes, this work investigates iterative approximate evaluation for arbitrary prompts and introduces Model Predictive Prompt Selection (MoPPS), a Bayesian risk-predictive framework that online estimates prompt difficulty without requiring costly LLM interactions. Technically, MoPPS models each prompt's success rate as a latent variable, performs streaming Bayesian inference, and employs posterior sampling in a constructed multi-armed bandit machine, enabling sample efficient and adaptive prompt selection. Extensive experiments across mathematics, planning, and vision-based geometry tasks show that MoPPS reliably predicts prompt difficulty and accelerates training with significantly reduced LLM rollouts.</p></details> |  |

We demonstrate that GSPO achieves superior training efficiency and performance compared to the GRPO algorithm, notably stabilizes Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) RL training, and has the potential for simplifying the design of RL infrastructure. These merits of GSPO have contributed to the remarkable improvements in the latest Qwen3 models.</p></details> |  |

However, many model-free RL algorithms experience performance degradation due to inaccurate value estimation, particularly the overestimation of Q-values, which can lead to suboptimal policies. To address this issue, we previously proposed the Distributional Soft Actor-Critic (DSAC or DSACv1), an off-policy RL algorithm that enhances value estimation accuracy by learning a continuous Gaussian value distribution. Despite its effectiveness, DSACv1 faces challenges such as training instability and sensitivity to reward scaling, caused by high variance in critic gradients due to return randomness. In this paper, we introduce three key refinements to DSACv1 to overcome these limitations and further improve Q-value estimation accuracy: expected value substitution, twin value distribution learning, and variance-based critic gradient adjustment. The enhanced algorithm, termed DSAC with Three refinements (DSAC-T or DSACv2), is systematically evaluated across a diverse set of benchmark tasks. Without the need for task-specific hyperparameter tuning, DSAC-T consistently matches or outperforms leading model-free RL algorithms, including SAC, TD3, DDPG, TRPO, and PPO, in all tested environments. Additionally, DSAC-T ensures a stable learning process and maintains robust performance across varying reward scales. Its effectiveness is further demonstrated through real-world application in controlling a wheeled robot, highlighting its potential for deployment in practical robotic tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title updated in this version.

CUDA-L1 achieves significant performance improvements on the CUDA optimization task: trained on NVIDIA A100, it delivers an average speedup of x3.12 with a median speedup of x1.42 across all 250 CUDA kernels of KernelBench, with peak speedups reaching x120. Furthermore, the model also demonstrates portability across GPU architectures, achieving average speedups of x3.12 on L40, x2.50 on RTX 3090, x2.39 on H100, and x2.37 on H20 despite being optimized specifically for A100. The capabilities of CUDA-L1 demonstrate that, RL can transform an initially poor-performing LLM into an effective CUDA optimizer through speedup-based reward signals alone, without human expertise or domain knowledge. This paradigm opens possibilities for automated optimization of CUDA operations, and holds promise to substantially promote GPU efficiency and alleviate the rising pressure on GPU computing resources. We also identify important challenges posed by training RL models for tasks like CUDA development, where RL often learns to exploit loopholes in reward functions rather than solve the intended optimization problems. By identifying these failure modes and analyzing their root causes, we develop practical methods for creating more robust training procedures that prevent reward hacking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://deepreinforce-ai.github.io/cudal1_blog/</p></details> |
| **[Action-List Reinforcement Learning Syndrome Decoding for Binary Linear Block Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17893v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to enhance the performance of decoding of linear block codes based on flipping bits and finding optimal decisions. We describe the methodology for mapping the iterative decoding process into Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) and propose different methods to reduce the number of states in the MDP. A truncated MDP is proposed to reduce the number of states in the MDP by learning a Hamming ball with a specified radius around codewords. We then propose a general scheme for reinforcement learning based decoders applicable to any class of codes to improve the performance of decoders. We call this scheme an action-list decoding. We design an action-list decoder based on the Deep-Q network values that substantially enhance performance. We also get benefit of automorphism group of code to further improve the code performance. Additionally, we propose a feedback-based method to exploit and enhance the performance of existing high-performing decoders by applying reinforcement learning algorithms after the existing decoders. These approaches effectively reduces the complexity of the reinforcement learning block. Finally, we present experimental results for the Low-Density Parity Check (LDPC) codes over the Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC) to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |

We propose the MuonClip optimizer, which improves upon Muon with a novel QK-clip technique to address training instability while enjoying the advanced token efficiency of Muon. Based on MuonClip, K2 was pre-trained on 15.5 trillion tokens with zero loss spike. During post-training, K2 undergoes a multi-stage post-training process, highlighted by a large-scale agentic data synthesis pipeline and a joint reinforcement learning (RL) stage, where the model improves its capabilities through interactions with real and synthetic environments. Kimi K2 achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source non-thinking models, with strengths in agentic capabilities.

It is developed by our proposed SafeLadder framework, which incorporates large-scale, progressive, safety-oriented reinforcement learning post-training, supported by a suite of multi-principled verifiers. Unlike previous alignment methods such as RLHF that simply learn human preferences, SafeLadder enables SafeWork-R1 to develop intrinsic safety reasoning and self-reflection abilities, giving rise to safety `aha' moments. Notably, SafeWork-R1 achieves an average improvement of $46.54\%$ over its base model Qwen2.5-VL-72B on safety-related benchmarks without compromising general capabilities, and delivers state-of-the-art safety performance compared to leading proprietary models such as GPT-4.1 and Claude Opus 4. To further bolster its reliability, we implement two distinct inference-time intervention methods and a deliberative search mechanism, enforcing step-level verification. Finally, we further develop SafeWork-R1-InternVL3-78B, SafeWork-R1-DeepSeek-70B, and SafeWork-R1-Qwen2.5VL-7B.

However, several critical challenges persist, including the dynamic optimization of network resources and UAV trajectories, limited UAV endurance, and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In this paper, we offer new insights into low-altitude economy networking by exploring intelligent UAV-assisted vehicle-to-everything communication strategies aligned with UAV energy efficiency. Particularly, we formulate an optimization problem of joint channel allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment in UAV-assisted vehicular networks. Taking CSI feedback delay into account, our objective is to maximize the vehicle-to-UAV communication sum rate while satisfying the UAV's long-term energy constraint. To this end, we first leverage Lyapunov optimization to decompose the original long-term problem into a series of per-slot deterministic subproblems. We then propose a diffusion-based deep deterministic policy gradient (D3PG) algorithm, which innovatively integrates diffusion models to determine optimal channel allocation, power control, and flight altitude adjustment decisions. Through extensive simulations using real-world vehicle mobility traces, we demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed D3PG algorithm compared to existing benchmark solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 11 figures, transactions paper</p></details> |

| **[Eyes Will Shut: A Vision-Based Next GPS Location Prediction Model by Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feed Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18661v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Next Location Prediction is a fundamental task in the study of human mobility, with wide-ranging applications in transportation planning, urban governance, and epidemic forecasting. In practice, when humans attempt to predict the next location in a trajectory, they often visualize the trajectory on a map and reason based on road connectivity and movement trends. However, the vast majority of existing next-location prediction models do not reason over maps \textbf{in the way that humans do}. Fortunately, the recent development of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has demonstrated strong capabilities in visual perception and even visual reasoning. This opens up a new possibility: by rendering both the road network and trajectory onto an image and leveraging the reasoning abilities of VLMs, we can enable models to perform trajectory inference in a human-like manner. To explore this idea, we first propose a method called Vision-Guided Location Search (VGLS), which evaluates whether a general-purpose VLM is capable of trajectory-based reasoning without modifying any of its internal parameters. Based on insights from the VGLS results, we further propose our main approach: VLMLocPredictor, which is composed of two stages: In the first stage, we design two Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) tasks that help the VLM understand road network and trajectory structures and acquire basic reasoning ability on such visual inputs. In the second stage, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Visual Map Feedback, enabling the model to self-improve its next-location prediction ability through interaction with the environment. Experiments conducted on datasets from four different cities show that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits superior cross-city generalization compared to other LLM-based approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contrastive learning-based agent modeling for deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00132v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems often require agents to collaborate with or compete against other agents with diverse goals, behaviors, or strategies. Agent modeling is essential when designing adaptive policies for intelligent machine agents in multiagent systems, as this is the means by which the ego agent understands other agents' behavior and extracts their meaningful policy representations. These representations can be used to enhance the ego agent's adaptive policy which is trained by reinforcement learning. However, existing agent modeling approaches typically assume the availability of local observations from other agents (modeled agents) during training or a long observation trajectory for policy adaption. To remove these constrictive assumptions and improve agent modeling performance, we devised a Contrastive Learning-based Agent Modeling (CLAM) method that relies only on the local observations from the ego agent during training and execution. With these observations, CLAM is capable of generating consistent high-quality policy representations in real-time right from the beginning of each episode. We evaluated the efficacy of our approach in both cooperative and competitive multi-agent environments. Our experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art on both cooperative and competitive tasks, highlighting the potential of contrastive learning-based agent modeling for enhancing reinforcement learning.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[REINFORCE++: An Efficient RLHF Algorithm with Robustness to Both Prompt and Reward Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03262v7)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) plays a crucial role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human values and preferences. While state-of-the-art applications like ChatGPT or GPT-4 commonly employ Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), the inclusion of a critic network introduces significant computational overhead. REINFORCE-based methods, such as REINFORCE Leave One-Out (RLOO), ReMax, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), address this limitation by eliminating the critic network. However, these approaches face challenges in accurate advantage estimation. Specifically, they estimate advantages independently for responses to each prompt, which can lead to overfitting on simpler prompts and vulnerability to reward hacking and may be biased. To address these challenges, we introduce REINFORCE++, a novel approach that removes the critic model while using the global advantage normalization which is unbiased to improve the training stability. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that REINFORCE++ exhibits robust performance across various reward models without requiring prompt set truncation. Furthermore, it achieves superior generalization in both RLHF and long chain-of-thought (CoT) settings compared to existing REINFORCE-based methods. The implementation is available at https://github.com/OpenRLHF/OpenRLHF.</p></details> | add experiments |

A key challenge is to identify and utilize source samples that are most relevant to the target domain. Existing approaches address this challenge by measuring domain gaps through domain classifiers, target transition dynamics modeling, or mutual information estimation using contrastive loss. However, these methods often require large target datasets, which is impractical in many real-world scenarios. In this work, we address cross-domain offline RL under a limited target data setting, identifying two primary challenges: (1) Dataset imbalance, which is caused by large source and small target datasets and leads to overfitting in neural network-based domain gap estimators, resulting in uninformative measurements; and (2) Partial domain overlap, where only a subset of the source data is closely aligned with the target domain. To overcome these issues, we propose DmC, a novel framework for cross-domain offline RL with limited target samples. Specifically, DmC utilizes $k$-nearest neighbor ($k$-NN) based estimation to measure domain proximity without neural network training, effectively mitigating overfitting. Then, by utilizing this domain proximity, we introduce a nearest-neighbor-guided diffusion model to generate additional source samples that are better aligned with the target domain, thus enhancing policy learning with more effective source samples. Through theoretical analysis and extensive experiments in diverse MuJoCo environments, we demonstrate that DmC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art cross-domain offline RL methods, achieving substantial performance gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at ECAI 2025</p></details> |

However, retrieval noises significantly impact the quality of LLMs' generation, necessitating the development of denoising mechanisms. Previous methods extract evidence straightforwardly without explicit thinking, which risks filtering out key clues and struggles with generalization. To this end, we propose LEAR, which learns to extract rational evidence by (1) explicitly reasoning to identify potential cues within retrieval contents first, and then (2) consciously extracting to avoid omitting any key cues helpful for answering questions. Specifically, we frame evidence reasoning and evidence extraction into one unified response for end-to-end training; apply knowledge token masks for disentanglement to derive reasoning-based and extraction-based answers; and devise three types of verifiable reward functions, including answer, length, and format, to update the model via the policy optimization algorithm. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of LEAR, providing compact and high-quality evidence, improving the accuracy of downstream tasks, and promoting effective application in online RAG systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 Figures, 10 Tables</p></details> |

Each token is then mapped to an embedding, enabling parallel attention computations while preserving the input's essential information. Due to the quadratic computational complexity of transformer self-attention mechanisms, token reduction has primarily been used as an efficiency strategy. This is especially true in single vision and language domains, where it helps balance computational costs, memory usage, and inference latency. Despite these advances, this paper argues that token reduction should transcend its traditional efficiency-oriented role in the era of large generative models. Instead, we position it as a fundamental principle in generative modeling, critically influencing both model architecture and broader applications. Specifically, we contend that across vision, language, and multimodal systems, token reduction can: (i) facilitate deeper multimodal integration and alignment, (ii) mitigate "overthinking" and hallucinations, (iii) maintain coherence over long inputs, and (iv) enhance training stability, etc. We reframe token reduction as more than an efficiency measure. By doing so, we outline promising future directions, including algorithm design, reinforcement learning-guided token reduction, token optimization for in-context learning, and broader ML and scientific domains. We highlight its potential to drive new model architectures and learning strategies that improve robustness, increase interpretability, and better align with the objectives of generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ZLKong/Awesome-Collection-Token-Reduction</p></details> |

| **[RIS-LAD: A Benchmark and Model for Referring Low-Altitude Drone Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20920v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored. Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small, cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at: https://github.com/AHideoKuzeA/RIS-LAD/.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically, inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficacy of Image Similarity as a Metric for Augmenting Small Dataset Retinal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04862v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments. Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are sufficiently dissimilar.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |

However, existing medical image segmentation methods are limited by the weak semantic expression of the target segmentation regions, which is caused by the low contrast between the target and non-target segmentation regions. To address this limitation, text prompt information has greast potential to capture the lesion location. However, existing text-guided methods suffer from insufficient cross-modal interaction and inadequate cross-modal feature expression. To resolve these issues, we propose the Text-guided Multi-stage Cross-perception network (TMC). In TMC, we introduce a multistage cross-attention module to enhance the model's understanding of semantic details and a multi-stage alignment loss to improve the consistency of cross-modal semantics. The results of the experiments demonstrate that our TMC achieves a superior performance with Dice of 84.77%, 78.50%, 88.73% in three public datasets (QaTa-COV19, MosMedData and Breast), outperforming UNet based networks and text-guided methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing large-scale Transformer-based models (such as FoodSAM) face challenges in meeting practical deploymentrequirements due to their massive parameter counts and high computational resource demands. This paper introduces TUNable Adapter module (Swin-TUNA), a Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method that integrates multiscale trainable adapters into the Swin Transformer architecture, achieving high-performance food image segmentation by updating only 4% of the parameters. The core innovation of Swin-TUNA lies in its hierarchical feature adaptation mechanism: it designs separable convolutions in depth and dimensional mappings of varying scales to address the differences in features between shallow and deep networks, combined with a dynamic balancing strategy for tasks-agnostic and task-specific features. Experiments demonstrate that this method achieves mIoU of 50.56% and 74.94% on the FoodSeg103 and UECFoodPix Complete datasets, respectively, surpassing the fully parameterized FoodSAM model while reducing the parameter count by 98.7% (to only 8.13M). Furthermore, Swin-TUNA exhibits faster convergence and stronger generalization capabilities in low-data scenarios, providing an efficient solution for assembling lightweight food image.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After discussion among the authors, some parts of the paper are deemed inappropriate and will be revised and resubmitted</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel hands-free Human-AI collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate the images.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[M-Net: MRI Brain Tumor Sequential Segmentation Network via Mesh-Cast](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20582v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MRI tumor segmentation remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where volumetric analysis faces unique computational demands due to the complexity of 3D data. The spatially sequential arrangement of adjacent MRI slices provides valuable information that enhances segmentation continuity and accuracy, yet this characteristic remains underutilized in many existing models. The spatial correlations between adjacent MRI slices can be regarded as "temporal-like" data, similar to frame sequences in video segmentation tasks. To bridge this gap, we propose M-Net, a flexible framework specifically designed for sequential image segmentation. M-Net introduces the novel Mesh-Cast mechanism, which seamlessly integrates arbitrary sequential models into the processing of both channel and temporal information, thereby systematically capturing the inherent "temporal-like" spatial correlations between MRI slices. Additionally, we define an MRI sequential input pattern and design a Two-Phase Sequential (TPS) training strategy, which first focuses on learning common patterns across sequences before refining slice-specific feature extraction. This approach leverages temporal modeling techniques to preserve volumetric contextual information while avoiding the high computational cost of full 3D convolutions, thereby enhancing the generalizability and robustness of M-Net in sequential segmentation tasks. Experiments on the BraTS2019 and BraTS2023 datasets demonstrate that M-Net outperforms existing methods across all key metrics, establishing itself as a robust solution for temporally-aware MRI tumor segmentation.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Accepted |
| **[NSegment : Label-specific Deformations for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19634v5)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Labeling errors in remote sensing (RS) image segmentation datasets often remain implicit and subtle due to ambiguous class boundaries, mixed pixels, shadows, complex terrain features, and subjective annotator bias. Furthermore, the scarcity of annotated RS data due to the high cost of labeling complicates training noise-robust models. While sophisticated mechanisms such as label selection or noise correction might address the issue mentioned above, they tend to increase training time and add implementation complexity. In this paper, we propose NSegment-a simple yet effective data augmentation solution to mitigate this issue. Unlike traditional methods, it applies elastic transformations only to segmentation labels, varying deformation intensity per sample in each training epoch to address annotation inconsistencies. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves the performance of RS image segmentation over various state-of-the-art models.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMwave: Wavelet-Driven Feature Enrichment for Effective Adaptation of Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20186v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large foundation models has propelled significant advances in various domains. The Segment Anything Model (SAM), a leading model for image segmentation, exemplifies these advances, outperforming traditional methods. However, such foundation models often suffer from performance degradation when applied to complex tasks for which they are not trained. Existing methods typically employ adapter-based fine-tuning strategies to adapt SAM for tasks and leverage high-frequency features extracted from the Fourier domain. However, Our analysis reveals that these approaches offer limited benefits due to constraints in their feature extraction techniques. To overcome this, we propose \textbf{\textit{SAMwave}}, a novel and interpretable approach that utilizes the wavelet transform to extract richer, multi-scale high-frequency features from input data. Extending this, we introduce complex-valued adapters capable of capturing complex-valued spatial-frequency information via complex wavelet transforms. By adaptively integrating these wavelet coefficients, SAMwave enables SAM's encoder to capture information more relevant for dense prediction. Empirical evaluations on four challenging low-level vision tasks demonstrate that SAMwave significantly outperforms existing adaptation methods. This superior performance is consistent across both the SAM and SAM2 backbones and holds for both real and complex-valued adapter variants, highlighting the efficiency, flexibility, and interpretability of our proposed method for adapting segment anything models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025.

Vision Mamba employs one-dimensional causal state-space recurrence to efficiently model global dependencies, thereby substantially mitigating DC-LRSS. However, its patch tokenization and 1D serialization disrupt local pixel adjacency and impose a low-pass filtering effect, resulting in Local High-frequency Information Capture Deficiency (LHICD) and two-dimensional Spatial Structure Degradation (2D-SSD), which in turn exacerbate LBA and LHD. In this work, we propose FaRMamba, a novel extension that explicitly addresses LHICD and 2D-SSD through two complementary modules. A Multi-Scale Frequency Transform Module (MSFM) restores attenuated high-frequency cues by isolating and reconstructing multi-band spectra via wavelet, cosine, and Fourier transforms. A Self-Supervised Reconstruction Auxiliary Encoder (SSRAE) enforces pixel-level reconstruction on the shared Mamba encoder to recover full 2D spatial correlations, enhancing both fine textures and global context. Extensive evaluations on CAMUS echocardiography, MRI-based Mouse-cochlea, and Kvasir-Seg endoscopy demonstrate that FaRMamba consistently outperforms competitive CNN-Transformer hybrids and existing Mamba variants, delivering superior boundary accuracy, detail preservation, and global coherence without prohibitive computational overhead.

| **[MambaVesselNet++: A Hybrid CNN-Mamba Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19931v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays an important role in computer-aided diagnosis. Traditional convolution-based U-shape segmentation architectures are usually limited by the local receptive field. Existing vision transformers have been widely applied to diverse medical segmentation frameworks due to their superior capabilities of capturing global contexts. Despite the advantage, the real-world application of vision transformers is challenged by their non-linear self-attention mechanism, requiring huge computational costs. To address this issue, the selective state space model (SSM) Mamba has gained recognition for its adeptness in modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data, particularly noted for its efficient memory costs. In this paper, we propose MambaVesselNet++, a Hybrid CNN-Mamba framework for medical image segmentation. Our MambaVesselNet++ is comprised of a hybrid image encoder (Hi-Encoder) and a bifocal fusion decoder (BF-Decoder). In Hi-Encoder, we first devise the texture-aware layer to capture low-level semantic features by leveraging convolutions. Then, we utilize Mamba to effectively model long-range dependencies with linear complexity. The Bi-Decoder adopts skip connections to combine local and global information of the Hi-Encoder for the accurate generation of segmentation masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MambaVesselNet++ outperforms current convolution-based, transformer-based, and Mamba-based state-of-the-arts across diverse medical 2D, 3D, and instance segmentation tasks.

Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable performance in various segmentation tasks, its application to RRSIS presents several challenges, including understanding the text-described RS scenes and generating effective prompts from text descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RS2-SAM2, a novel framework that adapts SAM2 to RRSIS by aligning the adapted RS features and textual features, providing pseudo-mask-based dense prompts, and enforcing boundary constraints. Specifically, we employ a union encoder to jointly encode the visual and textual inputs, generating aligned visual and text embeddings as well as multimodal class tokens. A bidirectional hierarchical fusion module is introduced to adapt SAM2 to RS scenes and align adapted visual features with the visually enhanced text embeddings, improving the model's interpretation of text-described RS scenes. To provide precise target cues for SAM2, we design a mask prompt generator, which takes the visual embeddings and class tokens as input and produces a pseudo-mask as the dense prompt of SAM2. Experimental results on several RRSIS benchmarks demonstrate that RS2-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Effective UNet Using Feature Interaction and Fusion for Organ Segmentation in Medical Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05324v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, pre-trained encoders are widely used in medical image segmentation due to their strong capability in extracting rich and generalized feature representations. However, existing methods often fail to fully leverage these features, limiting segmentation performance. In this work, a novel U-shaped model is proposed to address the above issue, including three plug-and-play modules. A channel spatial interaction module is introduced to improve the quality of skip connection features by modeling inter-stage interactions between the encoder and decoder. A channel attention-based module integrating squeeze-and-excitation mechanisms with convolutional layers is employed in the decoder blocks to strengthen the representation of critical features while suppressing irrelevant ones. A multi-level fusion module is designed to aggregate multi-scale decoder features, improving spatial detail and consistency in the final prediction. Comprehensive experiments on the synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset and automated cardiac diagnosis challenge dataset demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving the highest average Dice score of 86.05% and 92.58%, yielding improvements of 1.15% and 0.26%, respectively. In addition, the proposed model provides a balance between accuracy and computational complexity, with only 86.91 million parameters and 23.26 giga floating-point operations.</p></details> |  |

However, the speckle noise, low contrast, and unintuitive appearance of EUS make segmentation of pancreatic tumors with fully supervised deep learning (DL) models both error-prone and dependent on large, expert-curated annotation datasets. To address these challenges, we present TextSAM-EUS, a novel, lightweight, text-driven adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) that requires no manual geometric prompts at inference. Our approach leverages text prompt learning (context optimization) through the BiomedCLIP text encoder in conjunction with a LoRA-based adaptation of SAM's architecture to enable automatic pancreatic tumor segmentation in EUS, tuning only 0.86% of the total parameters. On the public Endoscopic Ultrasound Database of the Pancreas, TextSAM-EUS with automatic prompts attains 82.69% Dice and 85.28% normalized surface distance (NSD), and with manual geometric prompts reaches 83.10% Dice and 85.70% NSD, outperforming both existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) supervised DL models and foundation models (e.g., SAM and its variants). As the first attempt to incorporate prompt learning in SAM-based medical image segmentation, TextSAM-EUS offers a practical option for efficient and robust automatic EUS segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD</p></details> |

In this work, we present the current state of the Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST), with a particular focus on its flexible and modular postprocessing framework designed for the BraTS 2025 pre- and post-treatment glioma segmentation challenge. Since its debut in the 2024 BraTS adult glioma post-treatment segmentation challenge, MIST's postprocessing module has been significantly extended to support a wide range of transforms, including removal or replacement of small objects, extraction of the largest connected components, and morphological operations such as hole filling and closing. These transforms can be composed into user-defined strategies, enabling fine-grained control over the final segmentation output. We evaluate three such strategies - ranging from simple small-object removal to more complex, class-specific pipelines - and rank their performance using the BraTS ranking protocol. Our results highlight how MIST facilitates rapid experimentation and targeted refinement, ultimately producing high-quality segmentations for the BraTS 2025 challenge. MIST remains open source and extensible, supporting reproducible and scalable research in medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of 87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest that MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Source code is available at: https://github.com/1027865/MLRUPP</p></details> |  |

While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources) and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically, increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model architectures. The code will be available on Github.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.</p></details> |  |

It comprises two essential components: the localization module (LM) and the reconstruction module (RM) with our proposed bilateral reference (BiRef). The LM aids in object localization using global semantic information. Within the RM, we utilize BiRef for the reconstruction process, where hierarchical patches of images provide the source reference and gradient maps serve as the target reference. These components collaborate to generate the final predicted maps. We also introduce auxiliary gradient supervision to enhance focus on regions with finer details. Furthermore, we outline practical training strategies tailored for DIS to improve map quality and training process. To validate the general applicability of our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on four tasks to evince that BiRefNet exhibits remarkable performance, outperforming task-specific cutting-edge methods across all benchmarks.

Here, we focus on graphical humor as a paradigmatic example of image interpretation that requires elucidating the interaction of different scene elements in the context of prior cognitive knowledge. This paper introduces \textbf{HumorDB}, a novel, controlled, and carefully curated dataset designed to evaluate and advance visual humor understanding by AI systems. The dataset comprises diverse images spanning photos, cartoons, sketches, and AI-generated content, including minimally contrastive pairs where subtle edits differentiate between humorous and non-humorous versions. We evaluate humans, state-of-the-art vision models, and large vision-language models on three tasks: binary humor classification, funniness rating prediction, and pairwise humor comparison. The results reveal a gap between current AI systems and human-level humor understanding. While pretrained vision-language models perform better than vision-only models, they still struggle with abstract sketches and subtle humor cues. Analysis of attention maps shows that even when models correctly classify humorous images, they often fail to focus on the precise regions that make the image funny. Preliminary mechanistic interpretability studies and evaluation of model explanations provide initial insights into how different architectures process humor. Our results identify promising trends and current limitations, suggesting that an effective understanding of visual humor requires sophisticated architectures capable of detecting subtle contextual features and bridging the gap between visual perception and abstract reasoning.

However, existing deep networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by 1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages , 11 figures</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically transfer the original training process directly without specific adjustments for segmentation tasks. Furthermore, the commonly used pre-trained diffusion models still have deficiencies in feature extraction. Based on these considerations, we propose LEAF, a medical image segmentation model grounded in latent diffusion models. During the fine-tuning process, we replace the original noise prediction pattern with a direct prediction of the segmentation map, thereby reducing the variance of segmentation results. We also employ a feature distillation method to align the hidden states of the convolutional layers with the features from a transformer-based vision encoder. Experimental results demonstrate that our method enhances the performance of the original diffusion model across multiple segmentation datasets for different disease types. Notably, our approach does not alter the model architecture, nor does it increase the number of parameters or computation during the inference phase, making it highly efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MICCAI 2025</p></details> |

Current micrograph analysis of metallic materials relies on supervised methods, which require retraining for each new dataset and often perform inconsistently with only a few labeled samples. While SSL offers a promising alternative by leveraging unlabeled data, most existing methods still depend on large-scale datasets to be effective. MatSSL is designed to overcome this limitation. We first perform self-supervised pretraining on a small-scale, unlabeled dataset and then fine-tune the model on multiple benchmark datasets. The resulting segmentation models achieve 69.13% mIoU on MetalDAM, outperforming the 66.73% achieved by an ImageNet-pretrained encoder, and delivers consistently up to nearly 40% improvement in average mIoU on the Environmental Barrier Coating benchmark dataset (EBC) compared to models pretrained with MicroNet. This suggests that MatSSL enables effective adaptation to the metallographic domain using only a small amount of unlabeled data, while preserving the rich and transferable features learned from large-scale pretraining on natural images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential-UMamba: Rethinking Tumor Segmentation Under Limited Data Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18177v1)** | 2025-07-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In data-scarce scenarios, deep learning models often overfit to noise and irrelevant patterns, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen samples. To address these challenges in medical image segmentation, we introduce Diff-UMamba, a novel architecture that combines the UNet framework with the mamba mechanism for modeling long-range dependencies. At the heart of Diff-UMamba is a Noise Reduction Module (NRM), which employs a signal differencing strategy to suppress noisy or irrelevant activations within the encoder. This encourages the model to filter out spurious features and enhance task-relevant representations, thereby improving its focus on clinically meaningful regions. As a result, the architecture achieves improved segmentation accuracy and robustness, particularly in low-data settings. Diff-UMamba is evaluated on multiple public datasets, including MSD (lung and pancreas) and AIIB23, demonstrating consistent performance gains of 1-3% over baseline methods across diverse segmentation tasks. To further assess performance under limited-data conditions, additional experiments are conducted on the BraTS-21 dataset by varying the proportion of available training samples. The approach is also validated on a small internal non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) dataset for gross tumor volume (GTV) segmentation in cone beam CT (CBCT), where it achieves a 4-5% improvement over the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05407v3)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptive segmentation typically relies on self-training using pseudo labels predicted by a pre-trained network on an unlabeled target dataset. However, the noisy nature of such pseudo-labels presents a major bottleneck in adapting a network to the distribution shift between source and target datasets. This challenge is exaggerated when the network encounters an incoming data stream in online fashion, where the network is constrained to adapt to incoming streams of target domain data in exactly one round of forward and backward passes. In this scenario, relying solely on inaccurate pseudo-labels can lead to low-quality segmentation, which is detrimental to medical image analysis where accuracy and precision are of utmost priority. We hypothesize that a small amount of pixel-level annotation obtained from an expert can address this problem, thereby enhancing the performance of domain adaptation of online streaming data, even in the absence of dedicated training data. We call our method ODES: Domain Adaptation with Expert Guidance for Online Medical Image Segmentation that adapts to each incoming data batch in an online setup, incorporating feedback from an expert through active learning. Through active learning, the most informative pixels in each image can be selected for expert annotation. However, the acquisition of pixel-level annotations across all images in a batch often leads to redundant information while increasing temporal overhead in online learning. To reduce the annotation acquisition time and make the adaptation process more online-friendly, we further propose a novel image-pruning strategy that selects the most useful subset of images from the current batch for active learning. Our proposed approach outperforms existing online adaptation approaches and produces competitive results compared to offline domain adaptive active learning methods.</p></details> |  |

| **[Fully Automated SAM for Single-source Domain Generalization in Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17281v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although SAM-based single-source domain generalization models for medical image segmentation can mitigate the impact of domain shift on the model in cross-domain scenarios, these models still face two major challenges. First, the segmentation of SAM is highly dependent on domain-specific expert-annotated prompts, which prevents SAM from achieving fully automated medical image segmentation and therefore limits its application in clinical settings. Second, providing poor prompts (such as bounding boxes that are too small or too large) to the SAM prompt encoder can mislead SAM into generating incorrect mask results. Therefore, we propose the FA-SAM, a single-source domain generalization framework for medical image segmentation that achieves fully automated SAM. FA-SAM introduces two key innovations: an Auto-prompted Generation Model (AGM) branch equipped with a Shallow Feature Uncertainty Modeling (SUFM) module, and an Image-Prompt Embedding Fusion (IPEF) module integrated into the SAM mask decoder. Specifically, AGM models the uncertainty distribution of shallow features through the SUFM module to generate bounding box prompts for the target domain, enabling fully automated segmentation with SAM. The IPEF module integrates multiscale information from SAM image embeddings and prompt embeddings to capture global and local details of the target object, enabling SAM to mitigate the impact of poor prompts. Extensive experiments on publicly available prostate and fundus vessel datasets validate the effectiveness of FA-SAM and highlight its potential to address the above challenges.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at the IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (IEEE SMC 2025) and is copyrighted by IEEE</p></details> |
| **[MyGO: Make your Goals Obvious, Avoiding Semantic Confusion in Prostate Cancer Lesion Region Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17269v1)** | 2025-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early diagnosis and accurate identification of lesion location and progression in prostate cancer (PCa) are critical for assisting clinicians in formulating effective treatment strategies. However, due to the high semantic homogeneity between lesion and non-lesion areas, existing medical image segmentation methods often struggle to accurately comprehend lesion semantics, resulting in the problem of semantic confusion. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Pixel Anchor Module, which guides the model to discover a sparse set of feature anchors that serve to capture and interpret global contextual information. This mechanism enhances the model's nonlinear representation capacity and improves segmentation accuracy within lesion regions. Moreover, we design a self-attention-based Top_k selection strategy to further refine the identification of these feature anchors, and incorporate a focal loss function to mitigate class imbalance, thereby facilitating more precise semantic interpretation across diverse regions. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the PI-CAI dataset, demonstrating 69.73% IoU and 74.32% Dice scores, and significantly improving prostate cancer lesion detection.</p></details> |  |

Addressing the differences in frequency band sensitivity between CNNs and the human visual system (mid-frequency sensitivity with low-frequency sensitivity surpassing high-frequency), we experimentally quantified the CNN contrast sensitivity function and proposed a wavelet adaptive spectrum fusion (WASF) method inspired by biological vision mechanisms to balance cross-frequency image features. Furthermore, we designed a perception frequency block (PFB) that integrates WASF to enhance frequency-domain feature extraction. Based on this, we developed the FE-UNet model, which employs a SAM2 backbone network and incorporates fine-tuned Hiera-Large modules to ensure segmentation accuracy while improving generalization capability. Experiments demonstrate that FE-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain tasks such as marine organism segmentation and polyp segmentation, showcasing robust adaptability and significant application potential.</p></details> |  |

This ''data gap'' is a key challenge both for building intelligent artificial systems and for understanding human development. Egocentric video capturing children's experience--their ''training data''--is a key ingredient for comparison of humans and models and for the development of algorithmic innovations to bridge this gap. Yet there are few such datasets available, and extant data are low-resolution, have limited metadata, and importantly, represent only a small set of children's experiences. Here, we provide the first release of a large developmental egocentric video dataset--the BabyView dataset--recorded using a high-resolution camera with a large vertical field-of-view and gyroscope/accelerometer data. This 868 hour dataset includes egocentric videos from children spanning 6 months to 3 years of age in longitudinal, at-home contexts. We provide gold-standard annotations for the evaluation of speech transcription, speaker diarization, and human pose estimation, and evaluate models in each of these domains. We train self-supervised language and vision models and evaluate their transfer to out-of-distribution tasks, including syntactic structure learning, object recognition, depth estimation, and image segmentation. Although performance in each domain scales with dataset size, overall performance is relatively lower than when models are trained on curated datasets, especially in the visual domain.

Extensive research is dedicated to the RGB-IR object detection, primarily focusing on how to integrate complementary features from RGB-IR modalities. However, they neglect the mono-modality insufficient learning problem, which arises from decreased feature extraction capability in multi-modal joint learning. This leads to a prevalent but unreasonable phenomenon\textemdash Fusion Degradation, which hinders the performance improvement of the MMOD model. Motivated by this, in this paper, we introduce linear probing evaluation to the multi-modal detectors and rethink the multi-modal object detection task from the mono-modality learning perspective. Therefore, we construct a novel framework called M$^2$D-LIF, which consists of the Mono-Modality Distillation (M$^2$D) method and the Local Illumination-aware Fusion (LIF) module. The M$^2$D-LIF framework facilitates the sufficient learning of mono-modality during multi-modal joint training and explores a lightweight yet effective feature fusion manner to achieve superior object detection performance. Extensive experiments conducted on three MMOD datasets demonstrate that our M$^2$D-LIF effectively mitigates the Fusion Degradation phenomenon and outperforms the previous SOTA detectors.

However, due to significant differences in resolution, field of view, and sensing characteristics across modalities, accurate registration is a prerequisite before fusion. Despite its importance, there is currently no publicly available benchmark specifically designed for multimodal registration in UAV-based aerial scenarios, which severely limits the development and evaluation of advanced registration methods under real-world conditions. To bridge this gap, we present ATR-UMMIM, the first benchmark dataset specifically tailored for multimodal image registration in UAV-based applications. This dataset includes 7,969 triplets of raw visible, infrared, and precisely registered visible images captured covers diverse scenarios including flight altitudes from 80m to 300m, camera angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year temporal variations under rich weather and illumination conditions. To ensure high registration quality, we design a semi-automated annotation pipeline to introduce reliable pixel-level ground truth to each triplet. In addition, each triplet is annotated with six imaging condition attributes, enabling benchmarking of registration robustness under real-world deployment settings. To further support downstream tasks, we provide object-level annotations on all registered images, covering 11 object categories with 77,753 visible and 78,409 infrared bounding boxes.

| **[Synthetic-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18911v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the high cost of collection and labeling, there are relatively few datasets for camouflaged object detection (COD). In particular, for certain specialized categories, the available image dataset is insufficiently populated. Synthetic datasets can be utilized to alleviate the problem of limited data to some extent. However, directly training with synthetic datasets compared to real datasets can lead to a degradation in model performance. To tackle this problem, in this work, we investigate a new task, namely Syn-to-Real Camouflaged Object Detection (S2R-COD). In order to improve the model performance in real world scenarios, a set of annotated synthetic camouflaged images and a limited number of unannotated real images must be utilized. We propose the Cycling Syn-to-Real Domain Adaptation Framework (CSRDA), a method based on the student-teacher model. Specially, CSRDA propagates class information from the labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain through pseudo labeling combined with consistency regularization. Considering that narrowing the intra-domain gap can improve the quality of pseudo labeling, CSRDA utilizes a recurrent learning framework to build an evolving real domain for bridging the source and target domain. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, mitigating the problem of limited data and handcraft annotations in COD. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/Muscape/S2R-COD.</p></details> |  |

While recent LLM-based NAS methods have shown promise, they often suffer from static search strategies and ambiguous architecture representations. We propose PhaseNAS, an LLM-based NAS framework with dynamic phase transitions guided by real-time score thresholds and a structured architecture template language for consistent code generation. On the NAS-Bench-Macro benchmark, PhaseNAS consistently discovers architectures with higher accuracy and better rank. For image classification (CIFAR-10/100), PhaseNAS reduces search time by up to 86% while maintaining or improving accuracy. In object detection, it automatically produces YOLOv8 variants with higher mAP and lower resource cost. These results demonstrate that PhaseNAS enables efficient, adaptive, and generalizable NAS across diverse vision tasks.</p></details> | 14pages |

To address this issue, we explore the advantages of short-wave infrared (SWIR) and long-wave infrared (LWIR) in ship detection and propose a novel single-stage image fusion detection algorithm called LSFDNet. This algorithm leverages feature interaction between the image fusion and object detection subtask networks, achieving remarkable detection performance and generating visually impressive fused images. To further improve the saliency of objects in the fused images and improve the performance of the downstream detection task, we introduce the Multi-Level Cross-Fusion (MLCF) module. This module combines object-sensitive fused features from the detection task and aggregates features across multiple modalities, scales, and tasks to obtain more semantically rich fused features. Moreover, we utilize the position prior from the detection task in the Object Enhancement (OE) loss function, further increasing the retention of object semantics in the fused images. The detection task also utilizes preliminary fused features from the fusion task to complement SWIR and LWIR features, thereby enhancing detection performance. Additionally, we have established a Nearshore Ship Long-Short Wave Registration (NSLSR) dataset to train effective SWIR and LWIR image fusion and detection networks, bridging a gap in this field. We validated the superiority of our proposed single-stage fusion detection algorithm on two datasets. The source code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Yanyin-Guo/LSFDNet</p></details> | ACMMM2025 |
| **[YOLO-PRO: Enhancing Instance-Specific Object Detection with Full-Channel Global Self-Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02348v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the inherent limitations of conventional bottleneck structures (diminished instance discriminability due to overemphasis on batch statistics) and decoupled heads (computational redundancy) in object detection frameworks by proposing two novel modules: the Instance-Specific Bottleneck with full-channel global self-attention (ISB) and the Instance-Specific Asymmetric Decoupled Head (ISADH). The ISB module innovatively reconstructs feature maps to establish an efficient full-channel global attention mechanism through synergistic fusion of batch-statistical and instance-specific features. Complementing this, the ISADH module pioneers an asymmetric decoupled architecture enabling hierarchical multi-dimensional feature integration via dual-stream batch-instance representation fusion. Extensive experiments on the MS-COCO benchmark demonstrate that the coordinated deployment of ISB and ISADH in the YOLO-PRO framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across all computational scales. Specifically, YOLO-PRO surpasses YOLOv8 by 1.0-1.6% AP (N/S/M/L/X scales) and outperforms YOLO11 by 0.1-0.5% AP in critical N/M/L/X groups, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. This work provides practical insights for developing high-precision detectors deployable on edge devices.</p></details> |  |

| **[An Improved YOLOv8 Approach for Small Target Detection of Rice Spikelet Flowering in Field Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20506v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately detecting rice flowering time is crucial for timely pollination in hybrid rice seed production. This not only enhances pollination efficiency but also ensures higher yields. However, due to the complexity of field environments and the characteristics of rice spikelets, such as their small size and short flowering period, automated and precise recognition remains challenging. To address this, this study proposes a rice spikelet flowering recognition method based on an improved YOLOv8 object detection model. First, a Bidirectional Feature Pyramid Network (BiFPN) replaces the original PANet structure to enhance feature fusion and improve multi-scale feature utilization. Second, to boost small object detection, a p2 small-object detection head is added, using finer feature mapping to reduce feature loss commonly seen in detecting small targets. Given the lack of publicly available datasets for rice spikelet flowering in field conditions, a high-resolution RGB camera and data augmentation techniques are used to construct a dedicated dataset, providing reliable support for model training and testing. Experimental results show that the improved YOLOv8s-p2 model achieves an mAP@0.5 of 65.9%, precision of 67.6%, recall of 61.5%, and F1-score of 64.41%, representing improvements of 3.10%, 8.40%, 10.80%, and 9.79%, respectively, over the baseline YOLOv8. The model also runs at 69 f/s on the test set, meeting practical application requirements. Overall, the improved YOLOv8s-p2 offers high accuracy and speed, providing an effective solution for automated monitoring in hybrid rice seed production.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Point Cloud Self-supervised Learning via 3D to Multi-view Masked Learner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10887v2)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, multi-modal masked autoencoders (MAE) has been introduced in 3D self-supervised learning, offering enhanced feature learning by leveraging both 2D and 3D data to capture richer cross-modal representations. However, these approaches have two limitations: (1) they inefficiently require both 2D and 3D modalities as inputs, even though the inherent multi-view properties of 3D point clouds already contain 2D modality. (2) input 2D modality causes the reconstruction learning to unnecessarily rely on visible 2D information, hindering 3D geometric representation learning. To address these challenges, we propose a 3D to Multi-View Learner (Multi-View ML) that only utilizes 3D modalities as inputs and effectively capture rich spatial information in 3D point clouds. Specifically, we first project 3D point clouds to multi-view 2D images at the feature level based on 3D-based pose. Then, we introduce two components: (1) a 3D to multi-view autoencoder that reconstructs point clouds and multi-view images from 3D and projected 2D features; (2) a multi-scale multi-head (MSMH) attention mechanism that facilitates local-global information interactions in each decoder transformer block through attention heads at various scales. Additionally, a novel two-stage self-training strategy is proposed to align 2D and 3D representations. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art counterparts across various downstream tasks, including 3D classification, part segmentation, and object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Autolabeling has emerged as a scalable alternative, allowing the generation of labels for point clouds with minimal human intervention. While LiDAR-based autolabeling methods leverage geometric information, they struggle with inherent limitations of lidar data, such as sparsity, occlusions, and incomplete object observations. Furthermore, these methods typically operate in a class-agnostic manner, offering limited semantic granularity. To address these challenges, we introduce VESPA, a multimodal autolabeling pipeline that fuses the geometric precision of LiDAR with the semantic richness of camera images. Our approach leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to enable open-vocabulary object labeling and to refine detection quality directly in the point cloud domain. VESPA supports the discovery of novel categories and produces high-quality 3D pseudolabels without requiring ground-truth annotations or HD maps. On Nuscenes dataset, VESPA achieves an AP of 52.95% for object discovery and up to 46.54% for multiclass object detection, demonstrating strong performance in scalable 3D scene understanding. Code will be available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network for Visible-Infrared Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20146v1)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible-infrared object detection aims to enhance the detection robustness by exploiting the complementary information of visible and infrared image pairs. However, its performance is often limited by frequent misalignments caused by resolution disparities, spatial displacements, and modality inconsistencies. To address this issue, we propose the Wavelet-guided Misalignment-aware Network (WMNet), a unified framework designed to adaptively address different cross-modal misalignment patterns. WMNet incorporates wavelet-based multi-frequency analysis and modality-aware fusion mechanisms to improve the alignment and integration of cross-modal features. By jointly exploiting low and high-frequency information and introducing adaptive guidance across modalities, WMNet alleviates the adverse effects of noise, illumination variation, and spatial misalignment. Furthermore, it enhances the representation of salient target features while suppressing spurious or misleading information, thereby promoting more accurate and robust detection. Extensive evaluations on the DVTOD, DroneVehicle, and M3FD datasets demonstrate that WMNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on misaligned cross-modal object detection tasks, confirming its effectiveness and practical applicability.</p></details> |  |

When integrating such models into aeronautical applications, a top-down safety assessment process must influence both the model performance metrics selected, and their acceptable range of values. Often, however, the relationship of system safety objectives to model performance requirements and the associated metrics is unclear. Using an example of an aircraft emergency braking system containing a machine learnt component (MLC) responsible for object detection and alerting, this paper first describes a simple abstraction of the required MLC behavior. Then, based on that abstraction, an initial method is given to derive the minimum safety-related performance requirements, the associated metrics, and their targets for the both MLC and its underlying deep neural network, such that they meet the quantitative safety objectives obtained from the safety assessment process. We give rationale as to why the proposed method should be considered valid, also clarifying the assumptions made, the constraints on applicability, and the implications for verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, Expanded version of the paper: G.

RCA reweights final-layer attention by suppressing extremes and amplifying mid-level activations to let semantically relevant but subdued tokens guide predictions. We evaluate it on Open Vocabulary Referring Object Detection (OV-RefOD), introducing FitAP, a confidence-free average precision metric based on IoU and box area. RCA improves FitAP in 11 out of 15 open-source VLMs, with gains up to $+26.6\%$. Effectiveness aligns with attention sharpness and fusion timing; while late-fusion models benefit consistently, models like $\texttt{DeepSeek-VL2}$ also improve, pointing to capacity and disentanglement as key factors.

Current approaches face significant limitations: 1) data-hungry training due to reliance on a large number of crowdsourced annotations, 2) susceptibility to "partial feature overfitting," and 3) limited flexibility due to required model architecture modifications. To tackle these issues, we present OW-CLIP, a visual analytics system that provides curated data and enables data-efficient OWOD model incremental training. OW-CLIP implements plug-and-play multimodal prompt tuning tailored for OWOD settings and introduces a novel "Crop-Smoothing" technique to mitigate partial feature overfitting. To meet the data requirements for the training methodology, we propose dual-modal data refinement methods that leverage large language models and cross-modal similarity for data generation and filtering. Simultaneously, we develope a visualization interface that enables users to explore and deliver high-quality annotations: including class-specific visual feature phrases and fine-grained differentiated images. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that OW-CLIP achieves competitive performance at 89% of state-of-the-art performance while requiring only 3.8% self-generated data, while outperforming SOTA approach when trained with equivalent data volumes. A case study shows the effectiveness of the developed method and the improved annotation quality of our visualization system.</p></details> | 9 pages, 11 figures |

Existing fusion approaches typically rely on either instance-based proposals or dense BEV grids, which either lack holistic scene understanding or are limited by rigid grid structures. To address these, we propose RaGS, the first framework to leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) as representation for fusing 4D radar and monocular cues in 3D object detection. 3D GS naturally suits 3D object detection by modeling the scene as a field of Gaussians, dynamically allocating resources on foreground objects and providing a flexible, resource-efficient solution. RaGS uses a cascaded pipeline to construct and refine the Gaussian field. It starts with the Frustum-based Localization Initiation (FLI), which unprojects foreground pixels to initialize coarse 3D Gaussians positions. Then, the Iterative Multimodal Aggregation (IMA) fuses semantics and geometry, refining the limited Gaussians to the regions of interest. Finally, the Multi-level Gaussian Fusion (MGF) renders the Gaussians into multi-level BEV features for 3D object detection. By dynamically focusing on sparse objects within scenes, RaGS enable object concentrating while offering comprehensive scene perception. Extensive experiments on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet, and OmniHD-Scenes benchmarks demonstrate its state-of-the-art performance.

| **[DS-Det: Single-Query Paradigm and Attention Disentangled Learning for Flexible Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19807v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Popular transformer detectors have achieved promising performance through query-based learning using attention mechanisms. However, the roles of existing decoder query types (e.g., content query and positional query) are still underexplored. These queries are generally predefined with a fixed number (fixed-query), which limits their flexibility. We find that the learning of these fixed-query is impaired by Recurrent Opposing inTeractions (ROT) between two attention operations: Self-Attention (query-to-query) and Cross-Attention (query-to-encoder), thereby degrading decoder efficiency. Furthermore, "query ambiguity" arises when shared-weight decoder layers are processed with both one-to-one and one-to-many label assignments during training, violating DETR's one-to-one matching principle. To address these challenges, we propose DS-Det, a more efficient detector capable of detecting a flexible number of objects in images. Specifically, we reformulate and introduce a new unified Single-Query paradigm for decoder modeling, transforming the fixed-query into flexible. Furthermore, we propose a simplified decoder framework through attention disentangled learning: locating boxes with Cross-Attention (one-to-many process), deduplicating predictions with Self-Attention (one-to-one process), addressing "query ambiguity" and "ROT" issues directly, and enhancing decoder efficiency. We further introduce a unified PoCoo loss that leverages box size priors to prioritize query learning on hard samples such as small objects. Extensive experiments across five different backbone models on COCO2017 and WiderPerson datasets demonstrate the general effectiveness and superiority of DS-Det. The source codes are available at https://github.com/Med-Process/DS-Det/.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches that use spatial transformations to create video sequences from static images fail for motion-guided tasks, as these transformations produce unrealistic optical flows that lack semantic understanding of motion. We present TransFlow, which transfers motion knowledge from pre-trained video diffusion models to generate realistic training data for video SOD. Video diffusion models have learned rich semantic motion priors from large-scale video data, understanding how different objects naturally move in real scenes. TransFlow leverages this knowledge to generate semantically-aware optical flows from static images, where objects exhibit natural motion patterns while preserving spatial boundaries and temporal coherence. Our method achieves improved performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating effective motion knowledge transfer.</p></details> | ICCVW 2025 |

While recent deep learning-based approaches have advanced AT mitigation using transformer and Mamba architectures, their high complexity and computational cost make them unsuitable for real-time applications, especially in resource-constrained settings such as remote surveillance. Moreover, the common practice of separating turbulence mitigation and object detection leads to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we propose JDATT, a Joint Distillation framework for Atmospheric Turbulence mitigation and Target detection. JDATT integrates state-of-the-art AT mitigation and detection modules and introduces a unified knowledge distillation strategy that compresses both components while minimizing performance loss. We employ a hybrid distillation scheme: feature-level distillation via Channel-Wise Distillation (CWD) and Masked Generative Distillation (MGD), and output-level distillation via Kullback-Leibler divergence. Experiments on synthetic and real-world turbulence datasets demonstrate that JDATT achieves superior visual restoration and detection accuracy while significantly reducing model size and inference time, making it well-suited for real-time deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 36th British Machine Vision Conference</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Co-Win, a novel bird's eye view (BEV) perception framework that integrates point cloud encoding with efficient parallel window-based feature extraction to address the multi-modality inherent in environmental understanding. Our method employs a hierarchical architecture comprising a specialized encoder, a window-based backbone, and a query-based decoder head to effectively capture diverse spatial features and object relationships. Unlike prior approaches that treat perception as a simple regression task, our framework incorporates a variational approach with mask-based instance segmentation, enabling fine-grained scene decomposition and understanding. The Co-Win architecture processes point cloud data through progressive feature extraction stages, ensuring that predicted masks are both data-consistent and contextually relevant. Furthermore, our method produces interpretable and diverse instance predictions, enabling enhanced downstream decision-making and planning in autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |

These features are continuously updated via over-the-air (OTA) mechanisms, resulting in a growing number of software versions and variants due to the diversity of vehicles, cloud/edge environments, and stakeholders involved. The lack of a unified integration environment further complicates development, as connected mobility solutions are often built in isolation. To ensure reliable operations across heterogeneous systems, a dynamic orchestration of functions that considers hardware and software variability is essential. This paper presents an open-source CI/CD pipeline tailored for SDVs. It automates the build, test, and deployment phases using a combination of containerized open-source tools, creating a standardized, portable, and scalable ecosystem accessible to all stakeholders. Additionally, a custom OTA middleware distributes software updates and supports rollbacks across vehicles and backend services. Update variants are derived based on deployment target dependencies and hardware configurations. The pipeline also supports continuous development and deployment of AI models for autonomous driving features. Its effectiveness is evaluated using an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario involving TurtleBots and a coordinating backend server. Two object detection variants are developed and deployed to match hardware-specific requirements. Results demonstrate seamless OTA updates, correct variant selection, and successful orchestration across all targets. Overall, the proposed pipeline provides a scalable and efficient solution for managing software variants and OTA updates in SDVs, contributing to the advancement of future mobility technologies.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Recent LiDAR scene flow models utilize the rigid-motion assumption at the instance level, assuming objects are rigid bodies. However, these instance-level methods are not suitable for sparse radar point clouds. In this work, we present a novel Traffic-Aware Radar Scene-Flow (TARS) estimation method, which utilizes motion rigidity at the traffic level. To address the challenges in radar scene flow, we perform object detection and scene flow jointly and boost the latter. We incorporate the feature map from the object detector, trained with detection losses, to make radar scene flow aware of the environment and road users. From this, we construct a Traffic Vector Field (TVF) in the feature space to achieve holistic traffic-level scene understanding in our scene flow branch. When estimating the scene flow, we consider both point-level motion cues from point neighbors and traffic-level consistency of rigid motion within the space. TARS outperforms the state of the art on a proprietary dataset and the View-of-Delft dataset, improving the benchmarks by 23% and 15%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Yet transmitting raw point clouds or full feature maps overwhelms Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) communications, causing latency and scalability problems. We introduce EffiComm, an end-to-end framework that transmits less than 40% of the data required by prior art while maintaining state-of-the-art 3D object detection accuracy. EffiComm operates on Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) feature maps from any modality and applies a two-stage reduction pipeline: (1) Selective Transmission (ST) prunes low-utility regions with a confidence mask; (2) Adaptive Grid Reduction (AGR) uses a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to assign vehicle-specific keep ratios according to role and network load. The remaining features are fused with a soft-gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention layer, offering greater capacity and specialization for effective feature integration. On the OPV2V benchmark, EffiComm reaches 0.84 mAP@0.7 while sending only an average of approximately 1.5 MB per frame, outperforming previous methods on the accuracy-per-bit curve. These results highlight the value of adaptive, learned communication for scalable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at ITSC 2025</p></details> |

To address real-world challenges in outdoor 3D object detection, fusion of LiDAR and RGB input has started gaining traction. However, effective integration of these modalities for precise object detection task still remains a largely open problem. To address that, we propose a MultiStream Detection (MuStD) network, that meticulously extracts task-relevant information from both data modalities. The network follows a three-stream structure. Its LiDAR-PillarNet stream extracts sparse 2D pillar features from the LiDAR input while the LiDAR-Height Compression stream computes Bird's-Eye View features. An additional 3D Multimodal stream combines RGB and LiDAR features using UV mapping and polar coordinate indexing. Eventually, the features containing comprehensive spatial, textural and geometric information are carefully fused and fed to a detection head for 3D object detection.

Existing roadside perception methods concentrate on model design but overlook data issues like calibration errors, sparse information, and multi-view consistency, leading to poor performance on recent published datasets. To significantly enhance roadside collaborative perception and address critical data issues, we present the first simulation framework RoCo-Sim for road-side collaborative perception. RoCo-Sim is capable of generating diverse, multi-view consistent simulated roadside data through dynamic foreground editing and full-scene style transfer of a single image. RoCo-Sim consists of four components: (1) Camera Extrinsic Optimization ensures accurate 3D to 2D projection for roadside cameras; (2) A novel Multi-View Occlusion-Aware Sampler (MOAS) determines the placement of diverse digital assets within 3D space; (3) DepthSAM innovatively models foreground-background relationships from single-frame fixed-view images, ensuring multi-view consistency of foreground; and (4) Scalable Post-Processing Toolkit generates more realistic and enriched scenes through style transfer and other enhancements. RoCo-Sim significantly improves roadside 3D object detection, outperforming SOTA methods by 83.74 on Rcooper-Intersection and 83.12 on TUMTraf-V2X for AP70. RoCo-Sim fills a critical gap in roadside perception simulation. Code and pre-trained models will be released soon: https://github.com/duyuwen-duen/RoCo-Sim</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion Attention for Remote Sensing Object Detection via Image Feature Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19118v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effectively describing features for cross-modal remote sensing image matching remains a challenging task due to the significant geometric and radiometric differences between multimodal images. Existing methods primarily extract features at the fully connected layer but often fail to capture cross-modal similarities effectively. We propose a Cross Spatial Temporal Fusion (CSTF) mechanism that enhances feature representation by integrating scale-invariant keypoints detected independently in both reference and query images. Our approach improves feature matching in two ways: First, by creating correspondence maps that leverage information from multiple image regions simultaneously, and second, by reformulating the similarity matching process as a classification task using SoftMax and Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) layers. This dual approach enables CSTF to maintain sensitivity to distinctive local features while incorporating broader contextual information, resulting in robust matching across diverse remote sensing modalities. To demonstrate the practical utility of improved feature matching, we evaluate CSTF on object detection tasks using the HRSC2016 and DOTA benchmark datasets. Our method achieves state-of-theart performance with an average mAP of 90.99% on HRSC2016 and 90.86% on DOTA, outperforming existing models. The CSTF model maintains computational efficiency with an inference speed of 12.5 FPS. These results validate that our approach to crossmodal feature matching directly enhances downstream remote sensing applications such as object detection.</p></details> |  |

Traditional optical character recognition (OCR) methods and conventional parsing engines demonstrate limited effectiveness when processing large-scale document datasets. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for information extraction that combines Augmented Intelligence (A2I) with computer vision and natural language processing techniques. Our approach addresses the limitations of conventional methods by leveraging deep learning architectures for object detection, particularly for tabular data extraction, and integrating cloud-based services for scalable document processing. The proposed methodology demonstrates improved accuracy and efficiency in extracting structured information from diverse document formats including PDFs, images, and scanned documents. Experimental validation shows significant improvements over traditional OCR-based approaches, particularly in handling complex document layouts and multi-modal content extraction.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel Noise-Resilient Query Optimization (NRQO) paradigm, which innovatively incorporates the Noise-Tolerance Feature Pyramid Network (NT-FPN) and the Pairwise-Similarity Region Proposal Network (PS-RPN). Specifically, NT-FPN mitigates noise during feature fusion in FPN by preserving spatial and semantic information integrity. Unlike existing label assignment strategies, PS-RPN generates a sufficient number of high-quality positive queries by enhancing anchor-ground truth matching through position and shape similarities, without the need for additional hyperparameters. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks consistently demonstrate the superiority of NRQO over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Conference on Multimedia and Expo (ICME)</p></details> |

Existing methods are primarily CNN-based and improve robustness through data augmentation combined with feature alignment. However, these methods are limited, as augmentation is only effective when the synthetic distribution approximates that of unseen domains, thus failing to ensure generalization across diverse scenarios. While DEtection TRansformer (DETR) has shown strong generalization in domain adaptation due to global context modeling, its potential for SDG remains underexplored. To this end, we propose Style-Adaptive DEtection TRansformer (SA-DETR), a DETR-based detector tailored for SDG. SA-DETR introduces an online domain style adapter that projects the style representation of unseen domains into the source domain via a dynamic memory bank. This bank self-organizes into diverse style prototypes and is continuously updated under a test-time adaptation framework, enabling effective style rectification. Additionally, we design an object-aware contrastive learning module to promote extraction of domain-invariant features. By applying gating masks that constrain contrastive learning in both spatial and semantic dimensions, this module facilitates instance-level cross-domain contrast and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments across five distinct weather scenarios demonstrate that SA-DETR consistently outperforms existing methods in both detection accuracy and domain generalization capability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology</p></details> |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art deep learning approaches YOLO-v11, YOLO-World, and YOLO-Classification on a real-world vehicle image dataset. This dataset was collected under challenging and unconstrained conditions by NSW Police Highway Patrol Vehicles. A multi-view inference (MVI) approach was deployed to enhance the performance of the models' predictions. To conduct the analyses, datasets with 100,000 plus images were created for each of the three metadata prediction tasks, specifically make, shape and colour. The models were tested on a separate dataset with 29,937 images belonging to 1809 number plates. Different sets of experiments have been investigated by varying the models sizes. A classification accuracy of 93.70%, 82.86%, 85.19%, and 94.86% was achieved with the best performing make, shape, colour, and colour-binary models respectively. It was concluded that there is a need to use MVI to get usable models within such complex real-world datasets. Our findings indicated that the object detection models YOLO-v11 and YOLO-World outperformed classification-only models in make and shape extraction. Moreover, smaller YOLO variants perform comparably to larger counterparts, offering substantial efficiency benefits for real-time predictions. This work provides a robust baseline for extracting vehicle metadata in real-world scenarios. Such models can be used in filtering and sorting user queries, minimising the time required to search large vehicle images datasets.</p></details> |  |

Current category-specific approaches achieve good accuracy but are impractical for real-world use, requiring separate models for each category and showing limited generalization. To tackle these issues, we propose TrackAny3D, the first framework to transfer large-scale pretrained 3D models for category-agnostic 3D SOT. We first integrate parameter-efficient adapters to bridge the gap between pretraining and tracking tasks while preserving geometric priors. Then, we introduce a Mixture-of-Geometry-Experts (MoGE) architecture that adaptively activates specialized subnetworks based on distinct geometric characteristics. Additionally, we design a temporal context optimization strategy that incorporates learnable temporal tokens and a dynamic mask weighting module to propagate historical information and mitigate temporal drift. Experiments on three commonly-used benchmarks show that TrackAny3D establishes new state-of-the-art performance on category-agnostic 3D SOT, demonstrating strong generalization and competitiveness. We hope this work will enlighten the community on the importance of unified models and further expand the use of large-scale pretrained models in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[OpenHuman4D: Open-Vocabulary 4D Human Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09880v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding dynamic 3D human representation has become increasingly critical in virtual and extended reality applications. However, existing human part segmentation methods are constrained by reliance on closed-set datasets and prolonged inference times, which significantly restrict their applicability. In this paper, we introduce the first 4D human parsing framework that simultaneously addresses these challenges by reducing the inference time and introducing open-vocabulary capabilities. Building upon state-of-the-art open-vocabulary 3D human parsing techniques, our approach extends the support to 4D human-centric video with three key innovations: 1) We adopt mask-based video object tracking to efficiently establish spatial and temporal correspondences, avoiding the necessity of segmenting all frames. 2) A novel Mask Validation module is designed to manage new target identification and mitigate tracking failures. 3) We propose a 4D Mask Fusion module, integrating memory-conditioned attention and logits equalization for robust embedding fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method on 4D human-centric parsing tasks, achieving up to 93.3% acceleration compared to the previous state-of-the-art method, which was limited to parsing fixed classes.</p></details> | BMVC 2025 |
| **[CoopTrack: Exploring End-to-End Learning for Efficient Cooperative Sequential Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19239v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative perception aims to address the inherent limitations of single-vehicle autonomous driving systems through information exchange among multiple agents. Previous research has primarily focused on single-frame perception tasks. However, the more challenging cooperative sequential perception tasks, such as cooperative 3D multi-object tracking, have not been thoroughly investigated. Therefore, we propose CoopTrack, a fully instance-level end-to-end framework for cooperative tracking, featuring learnable instance association, which fundamentally differs from existing approaches. CoopTrack transmits sparse instance-level features that significantly enhance perception capabilities while maintaining low transmission costs. Furthermore, the framework comprises two key components: Multi-Dimensional Feature Extraction, and Cross-Agent Association and Aggregation, which collectively enable comprehensive instance representation with semantic and motion features, and adaptive cross-agent association and fusion based on a feature graph. Experiments on both the V2X-Seq and Griffin datasets demonstrate that CoopTrack achieves excellent performance. Specifically, it attains state-of-the-art results on V2X-Seq, with 39.0\% mAP and 32.8\% AMOTA. The project is available at https://github.com/zhongjiaru/CoopTrack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (Highlight)</p></details> |
| **[Tell Me What to Track: Infusing Robust Language Guidance for Enhanced Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12561v3)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) is an emerging cross-modal task that aims to localize an arbitrary number of targets based on a language expression and continuously track them in a video. This intricate task involves reasoning on multi-modal data and precise target localization with temporal association. However, prior studies overlook the imbalanced data distribution between newborn targets and existing targets due to the nature of the task. In addition, they only indirectly fuse multi-modal features, struggling to deliver clear guidance on newborn target detection. To solve the above issues, we conduct a collaborative matching strategy to alleviate the impact of the imbalance, boosting the ability to detect newborn targets while maintaining tracking performance. In the encoder, we integrate and enhance the cross-modal and multi-scale fusion, overcoming the bottlenecks in previous work, where limited multi-modal information is shared and interacted between feature maps. In the decoder, we also develop a referring-infused adaptation that provides explicit referring guidance through the query tokens. The experiments showcase the superior performance of our model (+3.42%) compared to prior works, demonstrating the effectiveness of our designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[HQ-SMem: Video Segmentation and Tracking Using Memory Efficient Object Embedding With Selective Update and Self-Supervised Distillation Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18921v1)** | 2025-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Object Segmentation (VOS) is foundational to numerous computer vision applications, including surveillance, autonomous driving, robotics and generative video editing. However, existing VOS models often struggle with precise mask delineation, deformable objects, topologically transforming objects, tracking drift and long video sequences. In this paper, we introduce HQ-SMem, for High Quality video segmentation and tracking using Smart Memory, a novel method that enhances the performance of VOS base models by addressing these limitations. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: (i) leveraging SAM with High-Quality masks (SAM-HQ) alongside appearance-based candidate-selection to refine coarse segmentation masks, resulting in improved object boundaries; (ii) implementing a dynamic smart memory mechanism that selectively stores relevant key frames while discarding redundant ones, thereby optimizing memory usage and processing efficiency for long-term videos; and (iii) dynamically updating the appearance model to effectively handle complex topological object variations and reduce drift throughout the video. These contributions mitigate several limitations of existing VOS models including, coarse segmentations that mix-in background pixels, fixed memory update schedules, brittleness to drift and occlusions, and prompt ambiguity issues associated with SAM. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple public datasets and state-of-the-art base trackers demonstrate that our method consistently ranks among the top two on VOTS and VOTSt 2024 datasets. Moreover, HQ-SMem sets new benchmarks on Long Video Dataset and LVOS, showcasing its effectiveness in challenging scenarios characterized by complex multi-object dynamics over extended temporal durations.</p></details> | submit/6651762 |

In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |

We aim to bring that technology to field operators in the field who require flexible, high-performance edge AI system that can be adapted on a moment's notice. This paper introduces CHAMP (Configurable Hot-swappable Architecture for Machine Perception), a modular edge computing platform that allows operators to dynamically swap in specialized AI "capability cartridges" for tasks like face recognition, object tracking, and document analysis. CHAMP leverages low-power FPGA-based accelerators on a high-throughput bus, orchestrated by a custom operating system (VDiSK) to enable plug-and-play AI pipelines and cryptographically secured biometric datasets. In this paper we describe the CHAMP design, including its modular scaling with multiple accelerators and the VDiSK operating system for runtime reconfiguration, along with its cryptographic capabilities to keep data stored on modules safe and private. Experiments demonstrate near-linear throughput scaling from 1 to 5 neural compute accelerators, highlighting both the performance gains and saturation limits of the USB3-based bus. Finally, we discuss applications of CHAMP in field biometrics, surveillance, and disaster response, and outline future improvements in bus protocols, cartridge capabilities, and system software.</p></details> |  |
| **[R1-Track: Direct Application of MLLMs to Visual Object Tracking via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21980v3)** | 2025-07-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual single object tracking aims to continuously localize and estimate the scale of a target in subsequent video frames, given only its initial state in the first frame. This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> |  |

However, existing formulations assume an "offline" setting with full video access at query time, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with power and storage-constrained wearable devices. Towards more application-ready episodic memory systems, we introduce Online Visual Query 2D (OVQ2D), a task where models process video streams online, observing each frame only once, and retrieve object localizations using a compact memory instead of full video history. We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has benchmarked state-of-the-art methods and concluded that first person egocentric vision presents challenges compared to previously studied domains. However, these claims are based on evaluations conducted across significantly different scenarios. Many of the challenging characteristics attributed to egocentric vision are also present in third person videos of human-object activities. This raises a critical question: how much of the observed performance drop stems from the unique first person viewpoint inherent to egocentric vision versus the domain of human-object activities? To address this question, we introduce a new benchmark study designed to disentangle such factors. Our evaluation strategy enables a more precise separation of challenges related to the first person perspective from those linked to the broader domain of human-object activity understanding. By doing so, we provide deeper insights into the true sources of difficulty in egocentric tracking and segmentation, facilitating more targeted advancements on this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)</p></details> |

The difficulty stems from three main sources: the extreme scarcity of target appearance features, the complex motion entanglement caused by the combined dynamics of the camera and the targets themselves, and the frequent occlusions and identity ambiguity arising from dense flocking behavior. This paper details our championship-winning solution in the MVA 2025 "Finding Birds" Small Multi-Object Tracking Challenge (SMOT4SB), which adopts the tracking-by-detection paradigm with targeted innovations at both the detection and association levels. On the detection side, we propose a systematic training enhancement framework named \textbf{SliceTrain}. This framework, through the synergy of 'deterministic full-coverage slicing' and 'slice-level stochastic augmentation, effectively addresses the problem of insufficient learning for small objects in high-resolution image training. On the tracking side, we designed a robust tracker that is completely independent of appearance information. By integrating a \textbf{motion direction maintenance (EMA)} mechanism and an \textbf{adaptive similarity metric} combining \textbf{bounding box expansion and distance penalty} into the OC-SORT framework, our tracker can stably handle irregular motion and maintain target identities. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SMOT4SB public test set, reaching an SO-HOTA score of \textbf{55.205}, which fully validates the effectiveness and advancement of our framework in solving complex real-world SMOT problems. The source code will be made available at https://github.com/Salvatore-Love/YOLOv8-SMOT.</p></details> |  |

The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

In particular, one quasi-metric is an extension of the generalised optimal subpattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of objects. The other quasi-metric is an extension of the trajectory GOSPA (T-GOSPA) metric and measures the discrepancy between sets of trajectories. Similar to the GOSPA-based metrics, these quasi-metrics include costs for localisation error for properly detected objects, the number of false objects and the number of missed objects. The T-GOSPA quasi-metric also includes a track switching cost. Differently from the GOSPA and T-GOSPA metrics, the proposed quasi-metrics have the flexibility of penalising missed and false objects with different costs, and the localisation costs are not required to be symmetric. These properties can be useful in MOT evaluation in certain applications. The performance of several Bayesian MOT algorithms is assessed with the T-GOSPA quasi-metric via simulations.</p></details> |  |

Single-agent tracking offers resilience to adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training. In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

As a result, we develop a new version of InternVideo2.5 with a focus on enhancing the original MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained details and capture long-form temporal structure in videos. Specifically, our approach incorporates dense vision task annotations into MLLMs using direct preference optimization and develops compact spatiotemporal representations through adaptive hierarchical token compression. Experimental results demonstrate this unique design of LRC greatly improves the results of video MLLM in mainstream video understanding benchmarks (short & long), enabling the MLLM to memorize significantly longer video inputs (at least 6x longer than the original), and master specialized vision capabilities like object tracking and segmentation. Our work highlights the importance of multimodal context richness (length and fineness) in empowering MLLM's innate abilites (focus and memory), providing new insights for future research on video MLLM.

| **[On the Fragility of Multimodal Perception to Temporal Misalignment in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09095v1)** | 2025-07-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal fusion (MMF) plays a critical role in the perception of autonomous driving, which primarily fuses camera and LiDAR streams for a comprehensive and efficient scene understanding. However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, a novel attack that exploits network-induced delays to create subtle temporal misalignments across sensor streams, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals these sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. To detect such attacks, we propose AION, a defense patch that can work alongside the existing perception model to monitor temporal alignment through cross-modal temporal consistency. AION leverages multimodal shared representation learning and dynamic time warping to determine the path of temporal alignment and calculate anomaly scores based on the alignment. Our thorough evaluation of AION shows it achieves AUROC scores of 0.92-0.98 with low false positives across datasets and model architectures, demonstrating it as a robust and generalized defense against the temporal misalignment attacks.</p></details> | 16 pages |

The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank, enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions, and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Temporal Unlearnable Examples: Preventing Personal Video Data from Unauthorized Exploitation by Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07483v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of social media, vast amounts of user-uploaded videos (e.g., YouTube) are utilized as training data for Visual Object Tracking (VOT). However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.

| **[DecoderTracker: Decoder-Only Method for Multiple-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17170v6)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only methods, such as GPT, have demonstrated superior performance in many areas compared to traditional encoder-decoder structure transformer methods. Over the years, end-to-end methods based on the traditional transformer structure, like MOTR, have achieved remarkable performance in multi-object tracking. However,the substantial computational resource consumption of these methods, coupled with the optimization challenges posed by dynamic data, results in less favorable inference speeds and training times. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper optimized the network architecture and proposed an effective training strategy to mitigate the problem of prolonged training times, thereby developing DecoderTracker, a novel end-to-end tracking method. Subsequently, to tackle the optimization challenges arising from dynamic data, this paper introduced DecoderTracker+ by incorporating a Fixed-Size Query Memory and refining certain attention layers. Our methods, without any bells and whistles, outperforms MOTR on multiple benchmarks, \textcolor{black}{featuring a 2 to 3 times faster inference than MOTR}, respectively. The proposed method is implemented in open-source code, accessible at https://github.com/liaopan-lp/MO-YOLO.</p></details> |  |

We present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear fish swimming patterns and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios. MFT25 establishes a robust foundation for advancing research in underwater tracking systems with important applications in marine biology, aquaculture monitoring, and ecological conservation.

| **[Cooperative Mapping, Localization, and Beam Management via Multi-Modal SLAM in ISAC Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05718v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) plays a critical role in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems for sixth-generation (6G) millimeter-wave (mmWave) networks, enabling environmental awareness and precise user equipment (UE) positioning. While cooperative multi-user SLAM has demonstrated potential in leveraging distributed sensing, its application within multi-modal ISAC systems remains limited, particularly in terms of theoretical modeling and communication-layer integration. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal SLAM framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions. First, a Bayesian estimation framework is developed for cooperative multi-user SLAM, along with a two-stage algorithm for robust radio map construction under dynamic and heterogeneous sensing conditions. Second, a multi-modal localization strategy is introduced, fusing SLAM results with camera-based multi-object tracking and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data via an error-aware model, significantly improving UE localization in multi-user scenarios. Third, a sensing-aided beam management scheme is proposed, utilizing global radio maps and localization data to generate UE-specific prior information for beam selection, thereby reducing inter-user interference and enhancing downlink spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system improves radio map accuracy by up to 60%, enhances localization accuracy by 37.5%, and significantly outperforms traditional methods in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> |
| **[Self-Supervised Real-Time Tracking of Military Vehicles in Low-FPS UAV Footage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05229v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to maintain consistent identities of objects across video frames. Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology (IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in Oeiras, Portugal, 13-14 May 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrated Gaussian Processes for Robust and Adaptive Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04116v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a computationally efficient multi-object tracking approach that can minimise track breaks (e.g., in challenging environments and against agile targets), learn the measurement model parameters on-line (e.g., in dynamically changing scenes) and infer the class of the tracked objects, if joint tracking and kinematic behaviour classification is sought. It capitalises on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification (GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning (including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly more from simulated data).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> |
| **[CrowdTrack: A Benchmark for Difficult Multiple Pedestrian Tracking in Real Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02479v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them, pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information, non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution, the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33 videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at: https://github.com/loseevaya/CrowdTrack .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Tuning Method for Real-time Multiple-Object Tracking Utilizing Thermal Sensor with Complexity Motion Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02408v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution for real-world surveillance applications.</p></details> |  |

| **[Model-Agnostic Gender Bias Control for Text-to-Image Generation via Sparse Autoencoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20973v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models often exhibit gender bias, particularly by generating stereotypical associations between professions and gendered subjects. This paper presents SAE Debias, a lightweight and model-agnostic framework for mitigating such bias in T2I generation. Unlike prior approaches that rely on CLIP-based filtering or prompt engineering, which often require model-specific adjustments and offer limited control, SAE Debias operates directly within the feature space without retraining or architectural modifications. By leveraging a k-sparse autoencoder pre-trained on a gender bias dataset, the method identifies gender-relevant directions within the sparse latent space, capturing professional stereotypes. Specifically, a biased direction per profession is constructed from sparse latents and suppressed during inference to steer generations toward more gender-balanced outputs. Trained only once, the sparse autoencoder provides a reusable debiasing direction, offering effective control and interpretable insight into biased subspaces. Extensive evaluations across multiple T2I models, including Stable Diffusion 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, and SDXL, demonstrate that SAE Debias substantially reduces gender bias while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply sparse autoencoders for identifying and intervening in gender bias within T2I models. These findings contribute toward building socially responsible generative AI, providing an interpretable and model-agnostic tool to support fairness in text-to-image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modular Open Source Framework for Genomic Variant Calling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11513v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variant calling is a fundamental task in genomic research, essential for detecting genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions or deletions (indels). This paper presents an enhancement to DeepChem, a widely used open-source drug discovery framework, through the integration of DeepVariant. In particular, we introduce a variant calling pipeline that leverages DeepVariant's convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to improve the accuracy and reliability of variant detection. The implemented pipeline includes stages for realignment of sequencing reads, candidate variant detection, and pileup image generation, followed by variant classification using a modified Inception v3 model. Our work adds a modular and extensible variant calling framework to the DeepChem framework and enables future work integrating DeepChem's drug discovery infrastructure more tightly with bioinformatics pipelines.</p></details> |  |

One drawback of QBE searches is that they require sample query documents on hand that may not be available. ABDIR aims to offer users a flexible way to retrieve document images based on memorable visual features of document contents, describing document images with combinations of visual attributes determined via convolutional neural network (CNN)-based binary classifiers. We present an exploratory study of the use of generative AI to bridge the gap between QBE and ABDIR, focusing on historical documents as a use case for their diversity and uniqueness in visual features. We hypothesize that text-to-image (T2I) generation can be leveraged to create query document images using text prompts based on ABDIR-like attributes. We propose T2I-QBE, which uses Leonardo.Ai as the T2I generator with prompts that include a rough description of the desired document type and a list of the desired ABDIR-style attributes. This creates query images that are then used within the traditional QBE paradigm, which compares CNN-extracted query features to those of the document images in the dataset to retrieve the most relevant documents. Experiments on the HisIR19 dataset of historical documents confirm our hypothesis and suggest that T2I-QBE is a viable option for historical document image retrieval. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt at utilizing T2I generation for DIR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented as an extended abstract (double-blind review process) at the 2025 Scandinavian Conference on Image Analysis (SCIA). 4 pages</p></details> |

In this work we focus on its adaptations, which aim to fine-tune pre-trained models to perform specific downstream tasks, like medical data generation. While for DMs there exist many techniques, adaptations for VAR remain underexplored. Similarly, differentially private (DP) adaptations-ones that aim to preserve privacy of the adaptation data-have been extensively studied for DMs, while VAR lacks such solutions. In our work, we implement and benchmark many strategies for VAR, and compare them to state-of-the-art DM adaptation strategies. We observe that VAR outperforms DMs for non-DP adaptations, however, the performance of DP suffers, which necessitates further research in private adaptations for VAR.

These tools pose a serious threat to the widespread Know Your Customer (KYC) applications, requiring robust systems for detection of the forged Identity Documents (IDs). To facilitate the development of the detection algorithms, in this paper, we propose a novel publicly available (including commercial use) dataset, FantasyID, which mimics real-world IDs but without tampering with legal documents and, compared to previous public datasets, it does not contain generated faces or specimen watermarks. FantasyID contains ID cards with diverse design styles, languages, and faces of real people. To simulate a realistic KYC scenario, the cards from FantasyID were printed and captured with three different devices, constituting the bonafide class. We have emulated digital forgery/injection attacks that could be performed by a malicious actor to tamper the IDs using the existing generative tools. The current state-of-the-art forgery detection algorithms, such as TruFor, MMFusion, UniFD, and FatFormer, are challenged by FantasyID dataset. It especially evident, in the evaluation conditions close to practical, with the operational threshold set on validation set so that false positive rate is at 10%, leading to false negative rates close to 50% across the board on the test set.

However, critical questions remain on whether both high accuracy and fairness can be achieved with synthetic data. In this work, we evaluate the impact of synthetic data on bias and performance of FR systems. We generate balanced face dataset, FairFaceGen, using two state of the art text-to-image generators, Flux.1-dev and Stable Diffusion v3.5 (SD35), and combine them with several identity augmentation methods, including Arc2Face and four IP-Adapters. By maintaining equal identity count across synthetic and real datasets, we ensure fair comparisons when evaluating FR performance on standard (LFW, AgeDB-30, etc.) and challenging IJB-B/C benchmarks and FR bias on Racial Faces in-the-Wild (RFW) dataset. Our results demonstrate that although synthetic data still lags behind the real datasets in the generalization on IJB-B/C, demographically balanced synthetic datasets, especially those generated with SD35, show potential for bias mitigation. We also observe that the number and quality of intra-class augmentations significantly affect FR accuracy and fairness. These findings provide practical guidelines for constructing fairer FR systems using synthetic data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE International Joint Conference on Biometrics (IJCB), 2025</p></details> |
| **[PARTE: Part-Guided Texturing for 3D Human Reconstruction from a Single Image](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17332v3)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The misaligned human texture across different human parts is one of the main limitations of existing 3D human reconstruction methods. Each human part, such as a jacket or pants, should maintain a distinct texture without blending into others. The structural coherence of human parts serves as a crucial cue to infer human textures in the invisible regions of a single image. However, most existing 3D human reconstruction methods do not explicitly exploit such part segmentation priors, leading to misaligned textures in their reconstructions. In this regard, we present PARTE, which utilizes 3D human part information as a key guide to reconstruct 3D human textures. Our framework comprises two core components. First, to infer 3D human part information from a single image, we propose a 3D part segmentation module (PartSegmenter) that initially reconstructs a textureless human surface and predicts human part labels based on the textureless surface. Second, to incorporate part information into texture reconstruction, we introduce a part-guided texturing module (PartTexturer), which acquires prior knowledge from a pre-trained image generation network on texture alignment of human parts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art quality in 3D human reconstruction.

| **[Efficacy of Image Similarity as a Metric for Augmenting Small Dataset Retinal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04862v2)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments. Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are sufficiently dissimilar.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |

Thus, it remains unclear whether these models can accurately represent a wide variety of realistic visual entities. To bridge this gap, we propose KITTEN, a benchmark for Knowledge-InTensive image generaTion on real-world ENtities. Using KITTEN, we conduct a systematic study of the latest text-to-image models and retrieval-augmented models, focusing on their ability to generate real-world visual entities, such as landmarks and animals. Analysis using carefully designed human evaluations, automatic metrics, and MLLM evaluations show that even advanced text-to-image models fail to generate accurate visual details of entities. While retrieval-augmented models improve entity fidelity by incorporating reference images, they tend to over-rely on them and struggle to create novel configurations of the entity in creative text prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://kitten-project.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Hot-Swap MarkBoard: An Efficient Black-box Watermarking Approach for Large-scale Model Distribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20650v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have been increasingly deployed on end-user devices as On-Device AI, offering improved efficiency and privacy. However, this deployment trend poses more serious Intellectual Property (IP) risks, as models are distributed on numerous local devices, making them vulnerable to theft and redistribution. Most existing ownership protection solutions (e.g., backdoor-based watermarking) are designed for cloud-based AI-as-a-Service (AIaaS) and are not directly applicable to large-scale distribution scenarios, where each user-specific model instance must carry a unique watermark. These methods typically embed a fixed watermark, and modifying the embedded watermark requires retraining the model. To address these challenges, we propose Hot-Swap MarkBoard, an efficient watermarking method. It encodes user-specific $n$-bit binary signatures by independently embedding multiple watermarks into a multi-branch Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) module, enabling efficient watermark customization without retraining through branch swapping. A parameter obfuscation mechanism further entangles the watermark weights with those of the base model, preventing removal without degrading model performance. The method supports black-box verification and is compatible with various model architectures and DL tasks, including classification, image generation, and text generation. Extensive experiments across three types of tasks and six backbone models demonstrate our method's superior efficiency and adaptability compared to existing approaches, achieving 100\% verification accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Frequency-Aware Autoregressive Modeling for Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20454v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual autoregressive modeling, based on the next-scale prediction paradigm, exhibits notable advantages in image quality and model scalability over traditional autoregressive and diffusion models. It generates images by progressively refining resolution across multiple stages. However, the computational overhead in high-resolution stages remains a critical challenge due to the substantial number of tokens involved. In this paper, we introduce SparseVAR, a plug-and-play acceleration framework for next-scale prediction that dynamically excludes low-frequency tokens during inference without requiring additional training. Our approach is motivated by the observation that tokens in low-frequency regions have a negligible impact on image quality in high-resolution stages and exhibit strong similarity with neighboring tokens. Additionally, we observe that different blocks in the next-scale prediction model focus on distinct regions, with some concentrating on high-frequency areas. SparseVAR leverages these insights by employing lightweight MSE-based metrics to identify low-frequency tokens while preserving the fidelity of excluded regions through a small set of uniformly sampled anchor tokens. By significantly reducing the computational cost while maintaining high image generation quality, SparseVAR achieves notable acceleration in both HART and Infinity. Specifically, SparseVAR achieves up to a 2 times speedup with minimal quality degradation in Infinity-2B.</p></details> |  |

This is obtained by replacing the standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors. Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules, we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task (e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior samplers for the tasks considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) 2025.

| **[Manipulating Multimodal Agents via Cross-Modal Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14348v4)** | 2025-07-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of multimodal large language models has redefined the agent paradigm by integrating language and vision modalities with external data sources, enabling agents to better interpret human instructions and execute increasingly complex tasks. However, in this paper, we identify a critical yet previously overlooked security vulnerability in multimodal agents: cross-modal prompt injection attacks. To exploit this vulnerability, we propose CrossInject, a novel attack framework in which attackers embed adversarial perturbations across multiple modalities to align with target malicious content, allowing external instructions to hijack the agent's decision-making process and execute unauthorized tasks. Our approach incorporates two key coordinated components. First, we introduce Visual Latent Alignment, where we optimize adversarial features to the malicious instructions in the visual embedding space based on a text-to-image generative model, ensuring that adversarial images subtly encode cues for malicious task execution. Subsequently, we present Textual Guidance Enhancement, where a large language model is leveraged to construct the black-box defensive system prompt through adversarial meta prompting and generate an malicious textual command that steers the agent's output toward better compliance with attackers' requests. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art attacks, achieving at least a +30.1% increase in attack success rates across diverse tasks. Furthermore, we validate our attack's effectiveness in real-world multimodal autonomous agents, highlighting its potential implications for safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

How to keep automatic evaluation equitably aligned with human perception has become a well-recognized challenge. Recent advances in the field of language and image generation have explored human preferences and showcased respectable fitting ability. However, the 3D domain still lacks such a comprehensive preference dataset over generative models. To mitigate this absence, we develop 3DGen-Arena, an integrated platform in a battle manner. Then, we carefully design diverse text and image prompts and leverage the arena platform to gather human preferences from both public users and expert annotators, resulting in a large-scale multi-dimension human preference dataset 3DGen-Bench. Using this dataset, we further train a CLIP-based scoring model, 3DGen-Score, and a MLLM-based automatic evaluator, 3DGen-Eval. These two models innovatively unify the quality evaluation of text-to-3D and image-to-3D generation, and jointly form our automated evaluation system with their respective strengths. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of our scoring model in predicting human preferences, exhibiting a superior correlation with human ranks compared to existing metrics. We believe that our 3DGen-Bench dataset and automated evaluation system will foster a more equitable evaluation in the field of 3D generation, further promoting the development of 3D generative models and their downstream applications.

Existing methods typically treat them separately, struggling with limited high-quality data and poor generalization. However, both tasks require capturing complex visual variations while maintaining consistency between inputs and outputs. Inspired by this, we propose MIGE, a unified framework that standardizes task representations using multimodal instructions. It first treats subject-driven generation as creation on a blank canvas and instruction-based editing as modification of an existing image, establishing a shared input-output formulation, then introduces a novel multimodal encoder that maps free-form multimodal instructions into a unified vision-language space, integrating visual and semantic features through a feature fusion mechanism. This unification enables joint training of both tasks, providing two key advantages: (1) Cross-Task Enhancement: by leveraging shared visual and semantic representations, joint training improves instruction adherence and visual consistency in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing. (2) Generalization: learning in a unified format facilitates cross-task knowledge transfer, enabling MIGE to generalize to novel compositional tasks, including instruction-based subject-driven editing. Experiments show that MIGE excels in both subject-driven generation and instruction-based editing while setting a SOTA in the new task of instruction-based subject-driven editing.

However, they often struggle with complex prompts involving multiple objects and global or local style specifications. In such cases, the generated scenes tend to lack style uniformity and spatial coherence, limiting their utility in creative and controllable content generation. In this paper, we propose a simple, training-free architectural method called Local Prompt Adaptation (LPA). Our method decomposes the prompt into content and style tokens, and injects them selectively into the U-Net's attention layers at different stages. By conditioning object tokens early and style tokens later in the generation process, LPA enhances both layout control and stylistic consistency. We evaluate our method on a custom benchmark of 50 style-rich prompts across five categories and compare against strong baselines including Composer, MultiDiffusion, Attend-and-Excite, LoRA, and SDXL. Our approach outperforms prior work on both CLIP score and style consistency metrics, offering a new direction for controllable, expressive diffusion-based generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 8 figures, pre-print</p></details> |

In portrait generation, both the accuracy of human pose and the overall visual quality are crucial for realistic synthesis. Most existing methods focus on controlling the accuracy of generated poses, but ignore the quality assurance of the entire image. In order to ensure the global image quality and pose accuracy, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB) is designed not only to enhance pose accuracy but also to leverage image feature information to maintain overall image quality. Dynamic Masking (DM) dynamically adjusts the importance of pose-related regions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |

As these tools begin to influence how agricultural data is visualized and disseminated, the sector's diversity spanning both technical and non-technical researchers, demands a rigorous foundational study to demystify the image generation process. This research investigated the role of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically the DALL.E model by OpenAI, in advancing data generation and visualization techniques in agriculture. DALL.E, an advanced AI image generator, works alongside ChatGPT's language processing to transform text descriptions and image clues into realistic visual representations of the content. The study used both approaches of image generation: text-to-image and image-to-image (variation). Six types of datasets depicting fruit crop environment were generated. These AI-generated images were then compared against ground truth images captured by sensors in real agricultural fields. The comparison was based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Feature Similarity Index (FSIM) metrics. The image-to-image generation exhibited a 5.78% increase in average PSNR over text-to-image methods, signifying superior image clarity and quality. However, this method also resulted in a 10.23% decrease in average FSIM, indicating a diminished structural and textural similarity to the original images. Similar to these measures, human evaluation also showed that images generated using image-to-image-based method were more realistic compared to those generated with text-to-image approach. The results highlighted DALL.E's potential in generating realistic agricultural image datasets and thus accelerating the development and adoption of imaging-based precision agricultural solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisualCloze: A Universal Image Generation Framework via Visual In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07960v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in diffusion models significantly advances various image generation tasks. However, the current mainstream approach remains focused on building task-specific models, which have limited efficiency when supporting a wide range of different needs. While universal models attempt to address this limitation, they face critical challenges, including generalizable task instruction, appropriate task distributions, and unified architectural design. To tackle these challenges, we propose VisualCloze, a universal image generation framework, which supports a wide range of in-domain tasks, generalization to unseen ones, unseen unification of multiple tasks, and reverse generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on language-based task instruction, leading to task ambiguity and weak generalization, we integrate visual in-context learning, allowing models to identify tasks from visual demonstrations. Meanwhile, the inherent sparsity of visual task distributions hampers the learning of transferable knowledge across tasks. To this end, we introduce Graph200K, a graph-structured dataset that establishes various interrelated tasks, enhancing task density and transferable knowledge. Furthermore, we uncover that our unified image generation formulation shared a consistent objective with image infilling, enabling us to leverage the strong generative priors of pre-trained infilling models without modifying the architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025.

We present CLIP-JEM, a novel approach extending JEMs to the multimodal vision-language domain using CLIP, integrating both generative and discriminative objectives. For the generative one, we introduce an image-text joint-energy function based on Cosine similarity in the CLIP space, training CLIP to assign low energy to real image-caption pairs and high energy otherwise. For the discriminative one, we employ contrastive adversarial loss, extending the adversarial training objective to the multimodal domain. CLIP-JEM not only generates realistic images from text but also achieves competitive results on the compositionality benchmark, outperforming leading methods with fewer parameters. Additionally, we demonstrate the superior guidance capability of CLIP-JEM by enhancing CLIP-based generative frameworks and converting unconditional diffusion models to text-based ones. Lastly, we show that our model can serve as a more robust evaluation metric for text-to-image generative tasks than CLIP.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
| **[End-to-End Fine-Tuning of 3D Texture Generation using Differentiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18331v2)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent 3D generative models can produce high-quality texture images, they often fail to capture human preferences or meet task-specific requirements. Moreover, a core challenge in the 3D texture generation domain is that most existing approaches rely on repeated calls to 2D text-to-image generative models, which lack an inherent understanding of the 3D structure of the input 3D mesh object. To alleviate these issues, we propose an end-to-end differentiable, reinforcement-learning-free framework that embeds human feedback, expressed as differentiable reward functions, directly into the 3D texture synthesis pipeline. By back-propagating preference signals through both geometric and appearance modules of the proposed framework, our method generates textures that respect the 3D geometry structure and align with desired criteria. To demonstrate its versatility, we introduce three novel geometry-aware reward functions, which offer a more controllable and interpretable pathway for creating high-quality 3D content from natural language. By conducting qualitative, quantitative, and user-preference evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that our proposed strategy consistently outperforms existing approaches. We will make our implementation code publicly available upon acceptance of the paper.</p></details> |  |

To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[Defining ethically sourced code generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19743v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several code generation models have been proposed to help reduce time and effort in solving software-related tasks. To ensure responsible AI, there are growing interests over various ethical issues (e.g., unclear licensing, privacy, fairness, and environment impact). These studies have the overarching goal of ensuring ethically sourced generation, which has gained growing attentions in speech synthesis and image generation. In this paper, we introduce the novel notion of Ethically Sourced Code Generation (ES-CodeGen) to refer to managing all processes involved in code generation model development from data collection to post-deployment via ethical and sustainable practices. To build a taxonomy of ES-CodeGen, we perform a two-phase literature review where we read 803 papers across various domains and specific to AI-based code generation. We identified 71 relevant papers with 10 initial dimensions of ES-CodeGen. To refine our dimensions and gain insights on consequences of ES-CodeGen, we surveyed 32 practitioners, which include six developers who submitted GitHub issues to opt-out from the Stack dataset (these impacted users have real-world experience of ethically sourcing issues in code generation models). The results lead to 11 dimensions of ES-CodeGen with a new dimension on code quality as practitioners have noted its importance. We also identified consequences, artifacts, and stages relevant to ES-CodeGen. Our post-survey reflection showed that most practitioners tend to ignore social-related dimensions despite their importance. Most practitioners either agreed or strongly agreed that our survey help improve their understanding of ES-CodeGen. Our study calls for attentions of various ethical issues towards ES-CodeGen.</p></details> |  |

Despite shared architecture and learning frameworks, they prioritize different goals: generation seeks high perceptual quality and diversity, while reconstruction focuses on data fidelity and faithfulness. In this work, we introduce a "generative model zoo" and systematically analyze how modern latent diffusion models and autoregressive models navigate the reconstruction-generation spectrum. We benchmark a suite of generative models across representative cardiac medical imaging tasks, focusing on image inpainting with varying masking ratios and sampling strategies, as well as unconditional image generation. Our findings show that diffusion models offer superior perceptual quality for unconditional generation but tend to hallucinate as masking ratios increase, whereas autoregressive models maintain stable perceptual performance across masking levels, albeit with generally lower fidelity.</p></details> |  |

However, the issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and controllability.

However, these models present notable safety concerns, including the risk of generating harmful, biased, or private content. Current research on assessing T2I safety remains in its early stages. While some efforts have been made to evaluate models on specific safety dimensions, many critical risks remain unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce T2ISafety, a safety benchmark that evaluates T2I models across three key domains: toxicity, fairness, and bias. We build a detailed hierarchy of 12 tasks and 44 categories based on these three domains, and meticulously collect 70K corresponding prompts. Based on this taxonomy and prompt set, we build a large-scale T2I dataset with 68K manually annotated images and train an evaluator capable of detecting critical risks that previous work has failed to identify, including risks that even ultra-large proprietary models like GPTs cannot correctly detect. We evaluate 12 prominent diffusion models on T2ISafety and reveal several concerns including persistent issues with racial fairness, a tendency to generate toxic content, and significant variation in privacy protection across the models, even with defense methods like concept erasing.

However, existing evaluation frameworks have failed to evolve in parallel. This study reveals that human preference reward models fine-tuned based on CLIP and BLIP architectures have inherent flaws: they inappropriately assign low scores to images with rich details and high aesthetic value, creating a significant discrepancy with actual human aesthetic preferences. To address this issue, we design a novel evaluation score, ICT (Image-Contained-Text) score, that achieves and surpasses the objectives of text-image alignment by assessing the degree to which images represent textual content. Building upon this foundation, we further train an HP (High-Preference) score model using solely the image modality to enhance image aesthetics and detail quality while maintaining text-image alignment. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed evaluation model improves scoring accuracy by over 10\% compared to existing methods, and achieves significant results in optimizing state-of-the-art text-to-image models. This research provides theoretical and empirical support for evolving image generation technology toward higher-order human aesthetic preferences.

To mitigate malicious use, tracing the origin of such images is essential. Reconstruction-based attribution methods offer a promising solution, but they often suffer from reduced accuracy and high computational costs when applied to state-of-the-art (SOTA) models. To address these challenges, we propose AEDR (AutoEncoder Double-Reconstruction), a novel training-free attribution method designed for generative models with continuous autoencoders. Unlike existing reconstruction-based approaches that rely on the value of a single reconstruction loss, AEDR performs two consecutive reconstructions using the model's autoencoder, and adopts the ratio of these two reconstruction losses as the attribution signal. This signal is further calibrated using the image homogeneity metric to improve accuracy, which inherently cancels out absolute biases caused by image complexity, with autoencoder-based reconstruction ensuring superior computational efficiency. Experiments on eight top latent diffusion models show that AEDR achieves 25.5% higher attribution accuracy than existing reconstruction-based methods, while requiring only 1% of the computational time.</p></details> |  |

However, there are concerns about the gender bias of these models. Previous studies have shown that T2I models can perpetuate or even amplify gender stereotypes when provided with neutral text prompts. Researchers have proposed automated gender bias uncovering detectors for T2I models, but a crucial gap exists: no existing work comprehensively compares the various detectors and understands how the gender bias detected by them deviates from the actual situation. This study addresses this gap by validating previous gender bias detectors using a manually labeled dataset and comparing how the bias identified by various detectors deviates from the actual bias in T2I models, as verified by manual confirmation. We create a dataset consisting of 6,000 images generated from three cutting-edge T2I models: Stable Diffusion XL, Stable Diffusion 3, and Dreamlike Photoreal 2.0. During the human-labeling process, we find that all three T2I models generate a portion (12.48% on average) of low-quality images (e.g., generate images with no face present), where human annotators cannot determine the gender of the person. Our analysis reveals that all three T2I models show a preference for generating male images, with SDXL being the most biased. Additionally, images generated using prompts containing professional descriptions (e.g., lawyer or doctor) show the most bias. We evaluate seven gender bias detectors and find that none fully capture the actual level of bias in T2I models, with some detectors overestimating bias by up to 26.95%. We further investigate the causes of inaccurate estimations, highlighting the limitations of detectors in dealing with low-quality images. Based on our findings, we propose an enhanced detector...</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.</p></details> | Preprint |
