| **[Generalisation of RLHF under Reward Shift and Clipped KL Regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21765v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.</p></details> |  |
| **[GS-CLIP: Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection by Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19206v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot 3D Anomaly Detection is an emerging task that aims to detect anomalies in a target dataset without any target training data, which is particularly important in scenarios constrained by sample scarcity and data privacy concerns. While current methods adapt CLIP by projecting 3D point clouds into 2D representations, they face challenges. The projection inherently loses some geometric details, and the reliance on a single 2D modality provides an incomplete visual understanding, limiting their ability to detect diverse anomaly types. To address these limitations, we propose the Geometry-Aware Prompt and Synergistic View Representation Learning (GS-CLIP) framework, which enables the model to identify geometric anomalies through a two-stage learning process. In stage 1, we dynamically generate text prompts embedded with 3D geometric priors. These prompts contain global shape context and local defect information distilled by our Geometric Defect Distillation Module (GDDM). In stage 2, we introduce Synergistic View Representation Learning architecture that processes rendered and depth images in parallel. A Synergistic Refinement Module (SRM) subsequently fuses the features of both streams, capitalizing on their complementary strengths. Comprehensive experimental results on four large-scale public datasets show that GS-CLIP achieves superior performance in detection.

| **[Stabilizing Off-Policy Training for Long-Horizon LLM Agent via Turn-Level Importance Sampling and Clipping-Triggered Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20718v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms such as PPO and GRPO are widely used to train large language models (LLMs) for multi-turn agentic tasks. However, in off-policy training pipelines, these methods often exhibit unstable optimization dynamics and are prone to performance collapse. Through empirical analysis, we identify two fundamental sources of instability in this setting: (1)~a granularity mismatch between token-level policy optimization and turn-structured interactions, and (2) high-variance and unreliable gradient updates induced by off-policy importance sampling and inaccurate advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we propose SORL, \underline{S}tabilizing \underline{O}ff-Policy \underline{R}einforcement \underline{L}earning for Long-Horizon Agent Training. SORL introduces principled mechanisms that align policy optimization with the structure of multi-turn interactions and adaptively suppress unreliable off-policy updates, yielding more conservative and robust learning dynamics. Within this framework, we instantiate two stabilized algorithms: SO-PPO and SO-GRPO. Both algorithms are designed to mitigate gradient variance and prevent optimization collapse without requiring careful early stopping or heuristic tuning. We evaluate SO-PPO and SO-GRPO on a range of multi-turn search benchmarks, including general question answering, multi-hop question answering, and medical multiple-choice QA tasks. Experimental results show that both methods consistently prevent training instabilities and performance collapses observed in standard PPO and GRPO, maintain lower clipping ratios and more stable optimization trajectories, and achieve superior or comparable task performance. These results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides a practical, scalable, and general framework for stabilizing reinforcement learning in multi-turn LLM agent training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not Just What's There: Enabling CLIP to Comprehend Negated Visual Descriptions Without Fine-tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21035v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP struggle to understand negation, often embedding affirmatives and negatives similarly (e.g., matching "no dog" with dog images). Existing methods refine negation understanding via fine-tuning CLIP's text encoder, risking overfitting. In this work, we propose CLIPGlasses, a plug-and-play framework that enhances CLIP's ability to comprehend negated visual descriptions. CLIPGlasses adopts a dual-stage design: a Lens module disentangles negated semantics from text embeddings, and a Frame module predicts context-aware repulsion strength, which is integrated into a modified similarity computation to penalize alignment with negated semantics, thereby reducing false positive matches. Experiments show that CLIP equipped with CLIPGlasses achieves competitive in-domain performance and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in cross-domain generalization. Its superiority is especially evident under low-resource conditions, indicating stronger robustness across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization using CLIP-Based Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14889v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization, a lightweight framework for generating summaries by combining retrieved text and image data from web sources. Given a user-defined topic, the system performs parallel web, news, and image searches. Retrieved images are ranked using a fine-tuned CLIP model to measure semantic alignment with topic and text. Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment. This work provides a configurable, deployable tool for web-scale summarization that integrates language, retrieval, and vision models in a user-extensible pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computable Bernstein Certificates for Cross-Fitted Clipped Covariance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14020v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study operator-norm covariance estimation from heavy-tailed samples that may include a small fraction of arbitrary outliers. A simple and widely used safeguard is \emph{Euclidean norm clipping}, but its accuracy depends critically on an unknown clipping level. We propose a cross-fitted clipped covariance estimator equipped with \emph{fully computable} Bernstein-type deviation certificates, enabling principled data-driven tuning via a selector (\emph{MinUpper}) that balances certified stochastic error and a robust hold-out proxy for clipping bias. The resulting procedure adapts to intrinsic complexity measures such as effective rank under mild tail regularity and retains meaningful guarantees under only finite fourth moments. Experiments on contaminated spiked-covariance benchmarks illustrate stable performance and competitive accuracy across regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear and Latent-Linear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168v7)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) verifiable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of prediction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a seemingly-naive procedure can simultaneously offer all three desiderata. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc procedure in which we surgically manipulate the spectrum of the linear system after it was learned using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectral clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after any eigenvalues whose magnitude exceeds one have been clipped to one (without altering the eigenvectors). We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn nonlinear dynamical systems that can generate stable predictions of nonlinear phenomena, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate predictive dynamics that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our code and datasets can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Deepfakes with Multivariate Soft Blending and CLIP-based Image-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15903v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of highly realistic facial forgeries necessitates robust detection methods. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\% and 4.02\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Brain Signal Generation for Visual Prosthesis with CLIP Guided Multimodal Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present a novel image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging the diffusion transformer architecture enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) to achieve brain signal generation. To realize the goal of image-to-brain signal conversion, we use cross-attention mechanisms to align brain signal embeddings with CLIP image embeddings. Moreover, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate image captions, and concatenate the resulting CLIP text embeddings with CLIP image embeddings to form unified embeddings for cross-attention alignment, enabling our model to capture core semantic information. Moreover, to capture core semantic information, we use large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptive and semantically accurate captions for images. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable spatio-temporal position encoding that combines brain region embeddings with temporal embeddings to capture both spatial and temporal characteristics of brain signals. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-tuning for CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12461v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that CLIP model's adversarial robustness in zero-shot classification tasks can be enhanced by adversarially fine-tuning its image encoder with adversarial examples (AEs), which are generated by minimizing the cosine similarity between images and a hand-crafted template (e.g., ''A photo of a {label}''). However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/SAFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Image Detection with CLIP: Understanding and Assessing Predictive Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12381v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent generative models produce near-photorealistic images, challenging the trustworthiness of photographs. Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts. CLIP-based detectors perform well overall but generalize unevenly across diverse generative architectures. This highlights the need for continual model updates and broader training exposure, while reinforcing CLIP-based approaches as a strong foundation for more universal, robust SID.</p></details> | 11 figures; 23 pages |
| **[ArtContext: Contextualizing Artworks with Open-Access Art History Articles and Wikidata Knowledge through a LoRA-Tuned CLIP Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11349v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Gradient Clipping Becomes a Control Mechanism for Differential Privacy in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10584v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review in the Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Confusion Loop: CLIP-Guided Alignment for Source-Free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08730v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) tackles the problem of adapting a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without accessing any source data, which is quite suitable for the field of data security. Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation. Our code can be find at https://github.com/soloiro/CGA</p></details> |  |
| **[UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose UniLIP, a unified framework that adapts CLIP for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/nnnth/UniLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Word Sense Disambiguation with CLIP through Dual-Channel Text Prompting and Image Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06799v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguity poses persistent challenges in natural language understanding for large language models (LLMs). To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, pending journal/workshop submission</p></details> |

However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sliced Rényi Pufferfish Privacy: Directional Additive Noise Mechanism and Private Learning with Gradient Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01115v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the design of a privatization mechanism and privacy accounting in the Pufferfish Privacy (PP) family. Specifically, motivated by the curse of dimensionality and lack of practical composition tools for iterative learning in the recent Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (RPP) framework, we propose Sliced Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (SRPP). SRPP preserves PP/RPP semantics (customizable secrets with probability-aware secret-dataset relationships) while replacing high-dimensional Renyi divergence with projection-based quantification via two sliced measures, Average SRPP and Joint SRPP. We develop sliced Wasserstein mechanisms, yielding sound SRPP certificates and closed-form Gaussian noise calibration. For iterative learning systems, we introduce an SRPP-SGD scheme with gradient clipping and new accountants based on History-Uniform Caps (HUC) and a subsampling-aware variant (sa-HUC), enabling decompose-then-compose privatization and additive composition under a common slicing geometry. Experiments on static and iterative privatization show that the proposed framework exhibits favorable privacy-utility trade-offs, as well as practical scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-Map: Structured Matrix Mapping for Parameter-Efficient CLIP Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05909v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2025 6th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL)</p></details> |
| **[Tight Long-Term Tail Decay of (Clipped) SGD in Non-Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05657v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[CoPE: Clipped RoPE as A Scalable Free Lunch for Long Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05258v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGS-Net: Distillation-Guided Gradient Surgery for CLIP Fine-Tuning in AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13108v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models has led to the widespread proliferation of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy violations, and trust erosion in digital media. Although large-scale multimodal models like CLIP offer strong transferable representations for detecting synthetic content, fine-tuning them often induces catastrophic forgetting, which degrades pre-trained priors and limits cross-domain generalization. To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression. Extensive experiments on 50 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average margin of 6.6, achieving superior detection performance and generalization across diverse generation techniques.</p></details> |  |

The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/ClippedScion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less Precise Can Be More Reliable: A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v4)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have revolutionized zero-shot classification and safety-critical tasks, including Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient real-world deployment. While quantization is a standard solution for efficiency, its broader impact on reliability metrics beyond simple Top-1 accuracy remains critically under-explored. In this study, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of VLM quantization across a comprehensive experimental suite of over 700k evaluation runs with varying configurations. We find that, contrary to the assumption that quantization's noise degrades performance, it can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and robustness to noise, though not to covariate shift or spurious correlations. We leverage these counterintuitive findings to characterize the mechanics of quantization beyond simple regularization: we show that quantization dampens high-rank spectral components, compelling the model to rely more heavily on robust, low-rank features. Ultimately, this spectral filtering effect drives the observed improvements in generalization and noise tolerance, establishing a pathway to deploy faster, more reliable VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Explicit Uncertainty Modeling for Active CLIP Adaptation with Dual Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04340v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnHype: CLIP-Guided Hypernetworks for Dynamic LoRA Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03410v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Current DIA analysis frameworks, however, require semi-supervised training within each run for peptide-spectrum match (PSM) re-scoring. This approach is prone to overfitting and lacks generalizability across diverse species and experimental conditions. Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications. Moreover, DIA-CLIP holds immense potential for diverse practical applications, such as single-cell and spatial proteomics, where its enhanced identification depth facilitates the discovery of novel biomarkers and the elucidates of intricate cellular mechanisms.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations. Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.</p></details> |  |

| **[Improving Parametric Knowledge Access in Reasoning Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22193v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study reasoning for accessing world knowledge stored in a language model's parameters. For example, recalling that Canberra is Australia's capital may benefit from thinking through major cities and the concept of purpose-built capitals. While reasoning language models are trained via reinforcement learning to produce reasoning traces on tasks such as mathematics, they may not reason well for accessing their own world knowledge. We first find that models do not generate their best world knowledge reasoning by default: adding a simple "think step-by-step" cue demonstrates statistically significant improvement in knowledge recall but not math. Motivated by this, we propose training models to reason over their parametric knowledge using world-knowledge question answering as a verifiable reward. After reinforcement learning on TriviaQA (+9.9%), performance also improves on Natural Questions, HotpotQA, SimpleQA, and StrategyQA by 4.2%, 2.1%, 0.6%, and 3.0%, respectively. Reasoning models are under-optimized for parametric knowledge access, but can be easily trained to reason better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stagewise Reinforcement Learning and the Geometry of the Regret Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07524v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singular learning theory characterizes Bayesian learning as an evolving tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, with transitions between qualitatively different solutions as sample size increases. We extend this theory to reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of a generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that deep reinforcement learning with SGD should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over training manifest as "opposing staircases" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases.</p></details> | 48 pages, 10 figures |

While RLHF with expected reward constraints can be formulated as a primal-dual optimization problem, standard primal-dual methods only guarantee convergence with a distributional policy where the saddle-point problem is in convex-concave form. Moreover, standard primal-dual methods may exhibit instability or divergence in the last iterate under policy parameterization in practical applications. In this work, we propose a universal primal-dual framework for safe RLHF that unifies a broad class of existing alignment algorithms, including safe-RLHF, one-shot, and multi-shot based methods. Building on this framework, we introduce an optimistic primal-dual (OPD) algorithm that incorporates predictive updates for both primal and dual variables to stabilize saddle-point dynamics. We establish last-iterate convergence guarantees for the proposed method, covering both exact policy optimization in the distributional space and convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal solution whose gap is related to approximation error and bias under parameterized policies. Our analysis reveals that optimism plays a crucial role in mitigating oscillations inherent to constrained alignment objectives, thereby closing a key theoretical gap between constrained RL and practical RLHF.</p></details> |  |

We introduce SWE-Protégé, a post-training framework that reframes software repair as an expert-protégé collaboration problem. In SWE-Protégé, an SLM remains the sole decision-maker while learning to selectively seek guidance from a strong expert model, recognize stalled states, and follow through on expert feedback. Our approach combines supervised fine-tuning on expert-augmented trajectories with agentic reinforcement learning that explicitly discourages degenerative looping and unproductive expert collaboration. We lightly post-train Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct to achieve 42.4% Pass@1 on SWE-bench Verified, a +25.4% improvement over the prior SLM state of the art, while using expert assistance sparsely (~4 calls per task and 11% of total tokens).</p></details> |  |

Working with a parameterised set of DLOs, we use likelihood-free inference (LFI) to compute the posterior distributions for the physical parameters using which we can approximately simulate the behaviour of each specific DLO. We use these posteriors for domain randomisation while training, in simulation, object-specific visuomotor policies (i.e. assuming only visual and proprioceptive sensory) for a DLO reaching task, using model-free reinforcement learning. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by deploying sim-trained DLO manipulation policies in the real world in a zero-shot manner, i.e. without any further fine-tuning. In this context, we evaluate the capacity of a prominent LFI method to perform fine classification over the parametric set of DLOs, using only visual and proprioceptive data obtained in a dynamic manipulation trajectory. We then study the implications of the resulting domain distributions in sim-based policy learning and real-world performance.</p></details> |  |

This versatility allows them to achieve speed and energy-efficiency on smooth terrain and agility over rough terrain. Inspired by these athletes, we present the design and control of a robotic platform, Ultra Mobility Vehicle (UMV), which combines a bicycle and a reaction mass to move dynamically with minimal actuated degrees of freedom. We employ a simulation-driven design optimization process to synthesize a spatial linkage topology with a focus on vertical jump height and momentum-based balancing on a single wheel contact. Using a constrained Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer of diverse athletic behaviors, including track-stands, jumps, wheelies, rear wheel hopping, and front flips. This 23.5 kg robot is capable of high speeds (8 m/s) and jumping on and over large obstacles (1 m tall, or 130% of the robot's nominal height).</p></details> | <details><summary>19 Pa...</summary><p>19 Pages, 11 figures, 3 movies, 2 tables</p></details> |

This is because rebuttal is a complex process of strategic communication under severe information asymmetry rather than a simple technical debate. Consequently, current approaches struggle as they largely imitate surface-level linguistics, missing the essential element of perspective-taking required for effective persuasion. In this paper, we introduce RebuttalAgent, the first framework to ground academic rebuttal in Theory of Mind (ToM), operationalized through a ToM-Strategy-Response (TSR) framework that models reviewer mental state, formulates persuasion strategy, and generates evidence-based response. To train our agent, we construct RebuttalBench, a large-scale dataset synthesized via a novel critique-and-refine approach. Our training process consists of two stages, beginning with a supervised fine-tuning phase to equip the agent with ToM-based analysis and strategic planning capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning phase leveraging the self-reward mechanism for scalable self-improvement. For reliable and efficient automated evaluation, we further develop Rebuttal-RM, a specialized evaluator trained on over 100K samples of multi-source rebuttal data, which achieves scoring consistency with human preferences surpassing powerful judge GPT-4.1. Extensive experiments show RebuttalAgent significantly outperforms the base model by an average of 18.3% on automated metrics, while also outperforming advanced proprietary models across both automated and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[PanoEnv: Exploring 3D Spatial Intelligence in Panoramic Environments with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21992v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>360 panoramic images are increasingly used in virtual reality, autonomous driving, and robotics for holistic scene understanding. However, current Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with 3D spatial reasoning on Equirectangular Projection (ERP) images due to geometric distortion and limited 3D supervision. We introduce PanoEnv, a large-scale VQA benchmark built from synthetic 3D environments, containing 14.8K questions across five categories (e.g., relative position, volume comparison) grounded in accurate 3D annotations including depth, segmentation, and bounding boxes. Benchmarking 14 state-of-the-art VLMs reveals limited 3D understanding, achieving only 49.34% overall accuracy and 8.36% on open-ended (OE) questions. To enhance 3D reasoning, we propose a reinforcement learning post-training framework based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a ground-truth-guided reward that incorporates five geometry-aware strategies such as distance tolerance and spatial consistency. A two-stage curriculum further mitigates catastrophic forgetting: Stage 1 trains on structured tasks (true/false and multiple choice), and Stage 2 fine-tunes on mixed open-ended data to improve generalization. Our 7B model achieves new state-of-the-art performance, improving overall accuracy to 52.93% (+3.59%) and open-ended accuracy to 14.83% while maintaining structured-task performance. It also achieves top semantic evaluation scores (Q-Score 6.24, P-Score 5.95), surpassing 32B models. These results demonstrate that PanoEnv-QA and our curriculum-based RL framework effectively instill 3D spatial intelligence in VLMs for omnidirectional perception.</p></details> |  |

Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through both a supervised and reinforcement learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or policy based reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve near unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set as well as the control of non-Markovian systems. We also demonstrate that our transformer can perform energy minimization of non-integrable many-body quantum systems when trained for reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[RADAR: Reasoning as Discrimination with Aligned Representations for LLM-based Knowledge Graph Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21951v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge graph reasoning (KGR) infers missing facts, with recent advances increasingly harnessing the semantic priors and reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing generative paradigms are prone to memorizing surface-level co-occurrences rather than learning genuine relational semantics, limiting out-of-distribution generalization. To address this, we propose RADAR, which reformulates KGR from generative pattern matching to discriminative relational reasoning. We recast KGR as discriminative entity selection, where reinforcement learning enforces relative entity separability beyond token-likelihood imitation. Leveraging this separability, inference operates directly in representation space, ensuring consistency with the discriminative optimization and bypassing generation-induced hallucinations. Across four benchmarks, RADAR achieves 5-6% relative gains on link prediction and triple classification over strong LLM baselines, while increasing task-relevant mutual information in intermediate representations by 62.9%, indicating more robust and transferable relational reasoning.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose FigEx2, visual-conditioned framework that localizes panels and generates panel-wise captions directly from the compound figure. To mitigate the impact of diverse phrasing in open-ended captioning, we introduce a noise-aware gated fusion module that adaptively filters token-level features to stabilize the detection query space. Furthermore, we employ a staged optimization strategy combining supervised learning with reinforcement learning (RL), utilizing CLIP-based alignment and BERTScore-based semantic rewards to enforce strict multimodal consistency. To support high-quality supervision, we curate BioSci-Fig-Cap, a refined benchmark for panel-level grounding, alongside cross-disciplinary test suites in physics and chemistry. Experimental results demonstrate that FigEx2 achieves a superior 0.726 mAP@0.5:0.95 for detection and significantly outperforms Qwen3-VL-8B by 0.51 in METEOR and 0.24 in BERTScore. Notably, FigEx2 exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to out-of-distribution scientific domains without any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, existing open-source articulated-object datasets for simulation are limited by insufficient visual realism and low physical fidelity, which hinder their utility for training models mastering robotic tasks in real world. To address these challenges, we introduce ArtVIP, a comprehensive open-source dataset comprising high-quality digital-twin articulated objects, accompanied by indoor-scene assets. Crafted by professional 3D modelers adhering to unified standards, ArtVIP ensures visual realism through precise geometric meshes and high-resolution textures, while physical fidelity is achieved via fine-tuned dynamic parameters. Meanwhile, the dataset pioneers embedded modular interaction behaviors within assets and pixel-level affordance annotations. Feature-map visualization and optical motion capture are employed to quantitatively demonstrate ArtVIP's visual and physical fidelity, with its applicability validated across imitation learning and reinforcement learning experiments. Provided in USD format with detailed production guidelines, ArtVIP is fully open-source, benefiting the research community and advancing robot learning research.

However, previous work mainly focuses on English reasoning in expectation of the strongest performance, despite the demonstrated potential advantage of multilingual thinking, as well as the requirement for native thinking traces by global users. In this paper, we propose ExpLang, a novel LLM post-training pipeline that enables on-policy thinking language selection to improve exploration and exploitation during RL with the use of multiple languages. The results show that our method steadily outperforms English-only training with the same training budget, while showing high thinking language compliance for both seen and unseen languages. Analysis shows that, by enabling on-policy thinking language selection as an action during RL, ExpLang effectively extends the RL exploration space with diversified language preference and improves the RL exploitation outcome with leveraged non-English advantage. The method is orthogonal to most RL algorithms and opens up a new perspective on using multilinguality to improve LRMs.</p></details> |  |

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) approach that jointly optimizes decomposition quality and verifier alignment using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our method integrates: (i) structured sequential reasoning; (ii) supervised finetuning on teacher-distilled exemplars; and (iii) a multi-objective reward balancing format compliance, verifier alignment, and decomposition quality. Across six evaluation settings, our trained 8B decomposer improves downstream verification performance to (71.75%) macro-F1, outperforming prompt-based approaches ((+1.99), (+6.24)) and existing RL methods ((+5.84)). Human evaluation confirms the high quality of the generated subclaims. Our framework enables smaller language models to achieve state-of-the-art claim verification by jointly optimising for verification accuracy and decomposition quality.</p></details> | EACL Findings 2026 |
| **[Object-Centric World Models from Few-Shot Annotations for Sample-Efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16443v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep reinforcement learning (RL) from pixels has achieved remarkable success, its sample inefficiency remains a critical limitation for real-world applications. Model-based RL (MBRL) addresses this by learning a world model to generate simulated experience, but standard approaches that rely on pixel-level reconstruction losses often fail to capture small, task-critical objects in complex, dynamic scenes. We posit that an object-centric (OC) representation can direct model capacity toward semantically meaningful entities, improving dynamics prediction and sample efficiency. In this work, we introduce OC-STORM, an object-centric MBRL framework that enhances a learned world model with object representations extracted by a pretrained segmentation network. By conditioning on a minimal number of annotated frames, OC-STORM learns to track decision-relevant object dynamics and inter-object interactions without extensive labeling or access to privileged information. Empirical results demonstrate that OC-STORM significantly outperforms the STORM baseline on the Atari 100k benchmark and achieves state-of-the-art sample efficiency on challenging boss fights in the visually complex game Hollow Knight. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating OC priors into MBRL for complex visual domains. Project page: https://oc-storm.weipuzhang.com</p></details> |  |

We propose Knowledgeable-R1, a reinforcement-learning framework that explicitly trains large language models to use parametric knowledge (PK) to resist contextual interference while still exploiting external context when it is reliably helpful. Knowledgeable-R1 introduces a joint sampling scheme that generates paired responses with and without retrieval, and learns both local advantages (within each decoding regime) and global advantages under the same input to quantify when to ignore misleading context versus adopt it. We employ an asymmetric advantage transformation that amplifies exploratory behaviors toward parametric knowledge. Experiments show that Knowledgeable-R1 significantly improves robustness and reasoning accuracy in knowledge conflict scenarios and general RAG scenarios, outperforming SOTA baselines by +22.89% in counterfactual scenarios, and without degradation when the retrieved context is fully accurate.Our code are available at https://github.com/lcy80366872/knowledgeable-R1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically, naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance. Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the reasoning power of RLVR.</p></details> | 20 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Self-Curriculum Model-based Reinforcement Learning for Shape Control of Deformable Linear Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21816v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise shape control of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) is crucial in robotic applications such as industrial and medical fields. However, existing methods face challenges in handling complex large deformation tasks, especially those involving opposite curvatures, and lack efficiency and precision. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework combining Reinforcement Learning (RL) and online visual servoing. In the large-deformation stage, a model-based reinforcement learning approach using an ensemble of dynamics models is introduced to significantly improve sample efficiency. Additionally, we design a self-curriculum goal generation mechanism that dynamically selects intermediate-difficulty goals with high diversity through imagined evaluations, thereby optimizing the policy learning process. In the small-deformation stage, a Jacobian-based visual servo controller is deployed to ensure high-precision convergence. Simulation results show that the proposed method enables efficient policy learning and significantly outperforms mainstream baselines in shape control success rate and precision. Furthermore, the framework effectively transfers the policy trained in simulation to real-world tasks with zero-shot adaptation. It successfully completes all 30 cases with diverse initial and target shapes across DLOs of different sizes and materials.

Many existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based methods aim at improving sample efficiency in high-dimensional output action spaces. However, existing works often overlook the role of representations in achieving generalization of a manipulation policy in the complex input space during the hand-object interaction. In this paper, we propose DexRep, a novel hand-object interaction representation to capture object surface features and spatial relations between hands and objects for dexterous manipulation skill learning. Based on DexRep, policies are learned for three dexterous manipulation tasks, i.e. grasping, in-hand reorientation, bimanual handover, and extensive experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness. In simulation, for grasping, the policy learned with 40 objects achieves a success rate of 87.9% on more than 5000 unseen objects of diverse categories, significantly surpassing existing work trained with thousands of objects; for the in-hand reorientation and handover tasks, the policies also boost the success rates and other metrics of existing hand-object representations by 20% to 40%. The grasp policies with DexRep are deployed to the real world under multi-camera and single-camera setups and demonstrate a small sim-to-real gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Generalisation of RLHF under Reward Shift and Clipped KL Regularisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21765v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment and adaptation in large language models heavily rely on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF); yet, theoretical understanding of its generalisability remains premature, especially when the learned reward could shift, and the KL control is estimated and clipped. To address this issue, we develop generalisation theory for RLHF that explicitly accounts for (1) \emph{reward shift}: reward models are trained on preference data from earlier or mixed behaviour policies while RLHF optimises the current policy on its own rollouts; and (2) \emph{clipped KL regularisation}: the KL regulariser is estimated from sampled log-probability ratios and then clipped for stabilisation, resulting in an error to RLHF. We present generalisation bounds for RLHF, suggesting that the generalisation error stems from a sampling error from prompts and rollouts, a reward shift error, and a KL clipping error. We also discuss special cases of (1) initialising RLHF parameters with a uniform prior over a finite space, and (2) training RLHF by stochastic gradient descent, as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. The theory yields practical implications in (1) optimal KL clipping threshold, and (2) budget allocation in prompts, rollouts, and preference data.</p></details> |  |

However, existing approaches remain largely language-driven, relying on static visual encodings and lacking the ability to actively verify fine-grained visual evidence, which often leads to speculative reasoning in visually ambiguous cases. We propose V-Retrver, an evidence-driven retrieval framework that reformulates multimodal retrieval as an agentic reasoning process grounded in visual inspection. V-Retrver enables an MLLM to selectively acquire visual evidence during reasoning via external visual tools, performing a multimodal interleaved reasoning process that alternates between hypothesis generation and targeted visual verification.To train such an evidence-gathering retrieval agent, we adopt a curriculum-based learning strategy combining supervised reasoning activation, rejection-based refinement, and reinforcement learning with an evidence-aligned objective. Experiments across multiple multimodal retrieval benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in retrieval accuracy (with 23.0% improvements on average), perception-driven reasoning reliability, and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/chendy25/V-Retrver</p></details> |

MPPI has been widely applied as a GPU-accelerated random search method to deterministic direct single-shooting optimal control problems arising in model predictive control (MPC) formulations. MPPI offers several key advantages, including flexibility, robustness, ease of implementation, and inherent parallelizability. However, its performance can deteriorate in high-dimensional settings since the optimal control problem is solved via Monte Carlo sampling. To address this limitation, this paper proposes an enhanced MPPI method that incorporates a Jacobian reconstruction technique and the second-order Generalized Gauss-Newton method. This novel approach is called \textit{Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI}. The numerical results show that the Gauss-Newton accelerated MPPI approach substantially improves MPPI scalability and computational efficiency while preserving the key benefits of the classical MPPI framework, making it a promising approach even for high-dimensional problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, submitted to the IFAC World Congress 2026, parts of this preprint are directly taken from Chapter 3 of the main author's PhD thesis with title "Optimal Control for Efficient Vessel Operation: From Theory to Real-World Applications"</p></details> |

Although recent graph neural network (GNN) solutions achieve strong results, they remain hindered by two practical challenges: (i) severe class imbalance arising from the high cost of generating bots, and (ii) topological noise introduced by bots that skillfully mimic human behavior and forge deceptive links. We propose the Reinforcement-guided graph Augmentation social Bot detector (RABot), a multi-granularity graph-augmentation framework that addresses both issues in a unified manner. RABot employs a neighborhood-aware oversampling strategy that linearly interpolates minority-class embeddings within local subgraphs, thereby stabilizing the decision boundary under low-resource regimes. Concurrently, a reinforcement-learning-driven edge-filtering module combines similarity-based edge features with adaptive threshold optimization to excise spurious interactions during message passing, yielding a cleaner topology. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmarks and four GNN backbones demonstrate that RABot consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In addition, since its augmentation and filtering modules are orthogonal to the underlying architecture, RABot can be seamlessly integrated into existing GNN pipelines to boost performance with minimal overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multi-Modal LLMs Reasoning via Difficulty-Aware Group Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21743v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have significantly advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. Extending these methods to multimodal settings, however, faces a critical challenge: the instability of std-based normalization, which is easily distorted by extreme samples with nearly positive or negative rewards. Unlike pure-text LLMs, multimodal models are particularly sensitive to such distortions, as both perceptual and reasoning errors influence their responses. To address this, we characterize each sample by its difficulty, defined through perceptual complexity (measured via visual entropy) and reasoning uncertainty (captured by model confidence). Building on this characterization, we propose difficulty-aware group normalization (Durian), which re-groups samples by difficulty levels and shares the std within each group. Our approach preserves GRPO's intra-group distinctions while eliminating sensitivity to extreme cases, yielding significant performance gains across multiple multimodal reasoning benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, efficient reasoning aims to incentivize short yet accurate thinking trajectories, typically through reward shaping with Reinforcement Learning (RL). In this paper, we systematically investigate the mechanics of efficient reasoning for LLMs. For comprehensive evaluation, we advocate for more fine-grained metrics, including length distribution conditioned on correctness and performance across a wide spectrum of token budgets ranging from 2k to 32k. First, we reveal that the training process follows a two-stage paradigm: length adaptation and reasoning refinement. After that, we conduct extensive experiments (about 0.2 million GPU hours) in a unified protocol, deconstructing training prompts and rollouts, reward shaping, and optimization strategies. In particular, a key finding is to train on relatively easier prompts, ensuring the density of positive reward signals and thus avoiding the length collapse. Meanwhile, the learned length bias can be generalized across domains. We distill all findings into valuable insights and practical guidelines, and further validate them across the Qwen3 series, ranging from 0.6B to 30B, demonstrating the robustness and generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech Report, Insights on Efficient Reasoning via Reward Shaping</p></details> |

Due to the underlying dynamics misalignment between source and target domains, naively merging the two datasets may incur inferior performance. Recent advances address this issue by selectively leveraging source domain samples whose dynamics align well with the target domain. However, our work demonstrates that dynamics alignment alone is insufficient, by examining the limitations of prior frameworks and deriving a new target domain sub-optimality bound for the policy learned on the source domain. More importantly, our theory underscores an additional need for \textit{value alignment}, i.e., selecting high-quality, high-value samples from the source domain, a critical dimension overlooked by existing works. Motivated by such theoretical insight, we propose \textbf{\underline{D}}ynamics- and \textbf{\underline{V}}alue-aligned \textbf{\underline{D}}ata \textbf{\underline{F}}iltering (DVDF) method, a novel unified cross-domain RL framework that selectively incorporates source domain samples exhibiting strong alignment in \textit{both dynamics and values}. We empirically study a range of dynamics shift scenarios, including kinematic and morphology shifts, and evaluate DVDF on various tasks and datasets, even in the challenging setting where the target domain dataset contains an extremely limited amount of data. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DVDF consistently outperforms strong baselines with significant improvements.</p></details> |  |

A promising solution is to ground LLMs' answers in verifiable knowledge sources, such as Knowledge Graphs (KGs). Prevailing KG-enhanced methods typically constrained LLM reasoning either by enforcing rules during generation or by imitating paths from a fixed set of demonstrations. However, they naturally confined the reasoning patterns of LLMs within the scope of prior experience or fine-tuning data, limiting their generalizability to out-of-distribution graph reasoning problems. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose Explore-on-Graph (EoG), a novel framework that encourages LLMs to autonomously explore a more diverse reasoning space on KGs. To incentivize exploration and discovery of novel reasoning paths, we propose to introduce reinforcement learning during training, whose reward is the correctness of the reasoning paths' final answers. To enhance the efficiency and meaningfulness of the exploration, we propose to incorporate path information as additional reward signals to refine the exploration process and reduce futile efforts. Extensive experiments on five KGQA benchmark datasets demonstrate that, to the best of our knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming not only open-source but also even closed-source LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Existing approaches rely on reference motions or task-specific rewards, tightly coupling policies to particular object geometries and precluding multi-skill generalization within a single framework. A unified interaction representation enabling reference-free inference, geometric generalization, and long-horizon skill composition within one policy remains an open challenge. Here we show that Distance Field (DF) provides such a representation: LessMimic conditions a single whole-body policy on DF-derived geometric cues--surface distances, gradients, and velocity decompositions--removing the need for motion references, with interaction latents encoded via a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and post-trained using Adversarial Interaction Priors (AIP) under Reinforcement Learning (RL). Through DAgger-style distillation that aligns DF latents with egocentric depth features, LessMimic further transfers seamlessly to vision-only deployment without motion capture (MoCap) infrastructure. A single LessMimic policy achieves 80--100% success across object scales from 0.4x to 1.6x on PickUp and SitStand where baselines degrade sharply, attains 62.1% success on 5 task instances trajectories, and remains viable up to 40 sequentially composed tasks. By grounding interaction in local geometry rather than demonstrations, LessMimic offers a scalable path toward humanoid robots that generalize, compose skills, and recover from failures in unstructured environments.</p></details> |  |

Following prior work that relates cross-linguistic tendencies to biases in learning, we ask whether regular systems are common because regularity facilitates learning. Adopting methods from the Reinforcement Learning literature, we confirm that highly regular human(-like) systems are easier to learn than unattested but possible irregular systems. This asymmetry emerges under the natural assumption that recursive numeral systems are designed for generalisation from limited data to represent all integers exactly. We also find that the influence of regularity on learnability is absent for unnatural, highly irregular systems, whose learnability is influenced instead by signal length, suggesting that different pressures may influence learnability differently in different parts of the space of possible numeral systems. Our results contribute to the body of work linking learnability to cross-linguistic prevalence.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), we investigate how the superior linguistic understanding and broad world knowledge of LLMs can further strengthen CLIP, particularly in handling long and complex captions. We introduce an efficient fine-tuning framework that embeds an LLM into a pretrained CLIP while incurring nearly the same training cost as standard CLIP fine-tuning. Our method first converts the LLM into an embedding-compatible form for the CLIP setting, and then couples it with the pretrained CLIP vision encoder through a lightweight adaptor trained on only a few million image-caption pairs. With this strategy, we achieve large performance gains without large-scale retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art CLIP variants such as EVA02 and SigLIP-2. The LLM-enhanced CLIP delivers consistent improvements across a wide range of downstream tasks, including linear-probe classification, zero-shot image-text retrieval with both short and long captions (in English and other languages), zero-shot and supervised image segmentation, object detection, and serving as a tokenizer backbone for multimodal large-model benchmarks.

| **[Innovative Tooth Segmentation Using Hierarchical Features and Bidirectional Sequence Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21712v1)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tooth image segmentation is a cornerstone of dental digitization. However, traditional image encoders relying on fixed-resolution feature maps often lead to discontinuous segmentation and poor discrimination between target regions and background, due to insufficient modeling of environmental and global context. Moreover, transformer-based self-attention introduces substantial computational overhead because of its quadratic complexity (O(n^2)), making it inefficient for high-resolution dental images. To address these challenges, we introduce a three-stage encoder with hierarchical feature representation to capture scale-adaptive information in dental images. By jointly leveraging low-level details and high-level semantics through cross-scale feature fusion, the model effectively preserves fine structural information while maintaining strong contextual awareness. Furthermore, a bidirectional sequence modeling strategy is incorporated to enhance global spatial context understanding without incurring high computational cost. We validate our method on two dental datasets, with experimental results demonstrating its superiority over existing approaches. On the OralVision dataset, our model achieves a 1.1% improvement in mean intersection over union (mIoU).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Pattern Recognition</p></details> |

However, their clinical adoption has been hindered by a major requirement: training datasets with manually annotated landmarks that maintain point-to-point correspondences across patients rarely exist in practice. We introduce Mask-HybridGNet, a framework that trains graph-based models directly using standard pixel-wise masks, eliminating the need for manual landmark annotations. Our approach aligns variable-length ground truth boundaries with fixed-length landmark predictions by combining Chamfer distance supervision and edge-based regularization to ensure local smoothness and regular landmark distribution, further refined via differentiable rasterization. A significant emergent property of this framework is that predicted landmark positions become consistently associated with specific anatomical locations across patients without explicit correspondence supervision. This implicit atlas learning enables temporal tracking, cross-slice reconstruction, and morphological population analyses. Beyond direct segmentation, Mask-HybridGNet can extract correspondences from existing segmentation masks, allowing it to generate stable anatomical atlases from any high-quality pixel-based model. Experiments across chest radiography, cardiac ultrasound, cardiac MRI, and fetal imaging demonstrate that our model achieves competitive results against state-of-the-art pixel-based methods, while ensuring anatomical plausibility by enforcing boundary connectivity through a fixed graph adjacency matrix. This framework leverages the vast availability of standard segmentation masks to build structured models that maintain topological integrity and provide implicit correspondences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pareto-Guided Optimization for Uncertainty-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19365v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty in medical image segmentation is inherently non-uniform, with boundary regions exhibiting substantially higher ambiguity than interior areas. Conventional training treats all pixels equally, leading to unstable optimization during early epochs when predictions are unreliable. We argue that this instability hinders convergence toward Pareto-optimal solutions and propose a region-wise curriculum strategy that prioritizes learning from certain regions and gradually incorporates uncertain ones, reducing gradient variance. Methodologically, we introduce a Pareto-consistent loss that balances trade-offs between regional uncertainties by adaptively reshaping the loss landscape and constraining convergence dynamics between interior and boundary regions; this guides the model toward Pareto-approximate solutions. To address boundary ambiguity, we further develop a fuzzy labeling mechanism that maintains binary confidence in non-boundary areas while enabling smooth transitions near boundaries, stabilizing gradients, and expanding flat regions in the loss surface. Experiments on brain metastasis and non-metastatic tumor segmentation show consistent improvements across multiple configurations, with our method outperforming traditional crisp-set approaches in all tumor subregions.</p></details> |  |

While federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without centralizing data, cross-modality domain shifts pose a critical challenge, particularly when models trained on one modality fail to generalize to another. Many existing solutions require paired multimodal data per patient or rely on complex architectures, both of which are impractical in real clinical settings. In this work, we consider a realistic FL scenario where each client holds single-modality data (CT or MRI), and systematically investigate augmentation strategies for cross-modality generalization. Using abdominal organ segmentation and whole-heart segmentation as representative multi-class and binary segmentation benchmarks, we evaluate convolution-based spatial augmentation, frequency-domain manipulation, domain-specific normalization, and global intensity nonlinear (GIN) augmentation. Our results show that GIN consistently outperforms alternatives in both centralized and federated settings by simulating cross-modality appearance variations while preserving anatomical structure. For the pancreas, Dice score improved from 0.073 to 0.437, a 498% gain. Our federated approach achieves 93-98% of centralized training accuracy, demonstrating strong cross-modality generalization without compromising data privacy, pointing toward feasible federated AI deployment across diverse healthcare systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE JBHI</p></details> |

Despite significant advances in segmentation accuracy, the black-box nature of most deep models has raised growing concerns about their trustworthiness in high-stakes medical scenarios. Current explanation techniques have primarily focused on classification tasks, leaving the segmentation domain relatively underexplored. We introduced an explanation model for segmentation task which employs the causal inference framework and backpropagates the average treatment effect (ATE) into a quantification metric to determine the influence of input regions, as well as network components, on target segmentation areas. Through comparison with recent segmentation explainability techniques on two representative medical imaging datasets, we demonstrated that our approach provides more faithful explanations than existing approaches. Furthermore, we carried out a systematic causal analysis of multiple foundational segmentation models using our method, which reveals significant heterogeneity in perceptual strategies across different models, and even between different inputs for the same model. Suggesting the potential of our method to provide notable insights for optimizing segmentation models. Our code can be found at https://github.com/lcmmai/PdCR.</p></details> | Preprint |

Our approach leverages patch-level CLIP embeddings through probabilistic cross-modal attention, enabling bidirectional interaction between image and text tokens and explicit modeling of predictive uncertainty. Together with a soft patch-level contrastive loss that encourages more nuanced semantic learning across diverse textual prompts, MedCLIPSeg effectively improves data efficiency and domain generalizability. Extensive experiments across 16 datasets spanning five imaging modalities and six organs demonstrate that MedCLIPSeg outperforms prior methods in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, while providing interpretable uncertainty maps that highlight local reliability of segmentation results.

Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset. Additionally, we conduct case studies on lane detection using a customized indoor track dataset and simulated driving scenarios in CARLA, where we further evaluate the model's generalizability under diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

While data pooling (combining datasets from multiple sources) and data addition (adding more data from a new dataset) have been shown to enhance model performance, they are not without complications. Specifically, increasing the size of the training dataset through pooling or addition can induce distributional shifts, negatively affecting downstream model performance, a phenomenon known as the "Data Addition Dilemma". While the traditional i.i.d. assumption may not hold in multi-source contexts, assuming exchangeability across datasets provides a more practical framework for data pooling. In this work, we investigate medical image segmentation under these conditions, drawing insights from causal frameworks to propose a method for controlling foreground-background feature discrepancies across all layers of deep networks. This approach improves feature representations, which are crucial in data-addition scenarios. Our method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on histopathology and ultrasound images across five datasets, including a novel ultrasound dataset that we have curated and contributed. Qualitative results demonstrate more refined and accurate segmentation maps compared to prominent baselines across three model architectures.</p></details> | MIDL 2026 |

While effective, these modules introduce significant architectural complexity and computational overhead. Recent studies suggest that plain Vision Transformer (ViT) encoders, when scaled with sufficient capacity and large-scale pre-training, can conduct accurate image segmentation without requiring specialized modules. Motivated by this observation, we propose the Video Encoder-only Mask Transformer (VidEoMT), a simple encoder-only video segmentation model that eliminates the need for dedicated tracking modules. To enable temporal modeling in an encoder-only ViT, VidEoMT introduces a lightweight query propagation mechanism that carries information across frames by reusing queries from the previous frame. To balance this with adaptability to new content, it employs a query fusion strategy that combines the propagated queries with a set of temporally-agnostic learned queries. As a result, VidEoMT attains the benefits of a tracker without added complexity, achieving competitive accuracy while being 5x-10x faster, running at up to 160 FPS with a ViT-L backbone.

While Transformers have enabled global interactions among input elements in medical imaging, current computational challenges hinder their deployment on common hardware. Models like (Swin)UNETR adapt the UNet architecture by incorporating (Swin)Transformer encoders, which process tokens that each represent small subvolumes ($8^3$ voxels) of the input. The Transformer attention mechanism scales quadratically with the number of tokens, which is tied to the cubic scaling of 3D input resolution. This work reconsiders the role of convolution and attention, introducing Token-UNets, a family of 3D segmentation models that can operate in constrained computational environments and time frames. To mitigate computational demands, our approach maintains the convolutional encoder of UNet-like models, and applies TokenLearner to 3D feature maps. This module pools a preset number of tokens from local and global structures. Our results show this tokenization effectively encodes task-relevant information, yielding naturally interpretable attention maps. The memory footprint, computation times at inference, and parameter counts of our heaviest model are reduced to 33\%, 10\%, and 35\% of the SwinUNETR values, with better average performance (86.75\% $\pm 0.19\%$ Dice score for SwinUNETR vs our 87.21\% $\pm 0.35\%$).

| **[Activation-Space Uncertainty Quantification for Pretrained Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14934v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying pretrained models; yet, many strong methods for quantifying uncertainty require retraining, Monte Carlo sampling, or expensive second-order computations and may alter a frozen backbone's predictions. To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Redefining the Down-Sampling Scheme of U-Net for Precision Biomedical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19412v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>U-Net architectures have been instrumental in advancing biomedical image segmentation (BIS) but often struggle with capturing long-range information. One reason is the conventional down-sampling techniques that prioritize computational efficiency at the expense of information retention. This paper introduces a simple but effective strategy, we call it Stair Pooling, which moderates the pace of down-sampling and reduces information loss by leveraging a sequence of concatenated small and narrow pooling operations in varied orientations. Specifically, our method modifies the reduction in dimensionality within each 2D pooling step from $\frac{1}{4}$ to $\frac{1}{2}$. This approach can also be adapted for 3D pooling to preserve even more information. Such preservation aids the U-Net in more effectively reconstructing spatial details during the up-sampling phase, thereby enhancing its ability to capture long-range information and improving segmentation accuracy. Extensive experiments on three BIS benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed Stair Pooling can increase both 2D and 3D U-Net performance by an average of 3.8\% in Dice scores. Moreover, we leverage the transfer entropy to select the optimal down-sampling paths and quantitatively show how the proposed Stair Pooling reduces the information loss.</p></details> | AAPM 67th |
| **[SegMoTE: Token-Level Mixture of Experts for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19213v1)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis and quantitative analysis, yet remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of imaging modalities and the high cost of pixel-level annotations. Although general interactive segmentation models like SAM have achieved remarkable progress, their transfer to medical imaging still faces two key bottlenecks: (i) the lack of adaptive mechanisms for modality- and anatomy-specific tasks, which limits generalization in out-of-distribution medical scenarios; and (ii) current medical adaptation methods fine-tune on large, heterogeneous datasets without selection, leading to noisy supervision, higher cost, and negative transfer. To address these issues, we propose SegMoTE, an efficient and adaptive framework for medical image segmentation. SegMoTE preserves SAM's original prompt interface, efficient inference, and zero-shot generalization while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters to dynamically adapt across modalities and tasks. In addition, we design a progressive prompt tokenization mechanism that enables fully automatic segmentation, significantly reducing annotation dependence. Trained on MedSeg-HQ, a curated dataset less than 1% of existing large-scale datasets, SegMoTE achieves SOTA performance across diverse imaging modalities and anatomical tasks. It represents the first efficient, robust, and scalable adaptation of general segmentation models to the medical domain under extremely low annotation cost, advancing the practical deployment of foundation vision models in clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370v8)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in architectural design, data availability, and compute have driven remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. Yet, these models often rely on relaxed Bayesian assumptions, omitting critical uncertainty information needed for robust decision-making. Despite growing interest in probabilistic segmentation to address point-estimate limitations, the research landscape remains fragmented. In response, this review synthesizes foundational concepts in uncertainty modeling, analyzing how feature- and parameter-distribution modeling impact four key segmentation tasks: Observer Variability, Active Learning, Model Introspection, and Model Generalization. Our work establishes a common framework by standardizing theory, notation, and terminology, thereby bridging the gap between method developers, task specialists, and applied researchers. We then discuss critical challenges, including the nuanced distinction between uncertainty types, strong assumptions in spatial aggregation, the lack of standardized benchmarks, and pitfalls in current quantification methods. We identify promising avenues for future research, such as uncertainty-aware active learning, data-driven benchmarks, transformer-based models, and novel techniques to move from simple segmentation problems to uncertainty in holistic scene understanding. Based on our analysis, we offer practical guidelines for researchers on method selection, evaluation, reproducibility, and meaningful uncertainty estimation. Ultimately, our goal is to facilitate the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable segmentation models that can be confidently deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> | TMLR |
| **[MPCM-Net: Multi-scale network integrates partial attention convolution with Mamba for ground-based cloud image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11681v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground-based cloud image segmentation is a critical research domain for photovoltaic power forecasting. Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/CSRC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Pretraining-Induced Attention Asymmetry in 2D+ Electron Microscopy Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14105v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision models pretrained on large-scale RGB natural image datasets are widely reused for electron microscopy image segmentation. In electron microscopy, volumetric data are acquired as serial sections and processed as stacks of adjacent grayscale slices, where neighboring slices provide symmetric contextual information for identifying features on the central slice. The common strategy maps such stacks to pseudo-RGB inputs to enable transfer learning from pretrained models. However, this mapping imposes channel-specific semantics inherited from natural images, even though electron microscopy slices are homogeneous in the modality and symmetric in their predictive roles. As a result, pretrained models may encode inductive biases that are misaligned with the inherent symmetry of volumetric electron microscopy data. In this work, it is demonstrated that RGB-pretrained models systematically assign unequal importance to individual input slices when applied to stacked electron microscopy data, despite the absence of any intrinsic channel ordering. Using saliency-based attribution analysis across multiple architectures, a consistent channel-level asymmetry was observed that persists after fine-tuning and affects model interpretability, even when segmentation performance is unchanged. To address this issue, a targeted modification of pretraining weights based on uniform channel initialization was proposed, which restores symmetric feature attribution while preserving the benefits of pretraining. Experiments on the SNEMI, Lucchi and GF-PA66 datasets confirm a substantial reduction in attribution bias without compromising or even improving segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIPA: Visual Informative Part Attention for Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14788v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Curriculum Multi-Task Self-Supervision Improves Lightweight Architectures for Onboard Satellite Hyperspectral Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13229v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data difficulty during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/CMTSSL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation on Low Quality Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14042v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks. Code, models, and datasets will be available at https://github.com/Ka1Guan/RASS.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Certainty Equivalent Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13660v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical applications such as medical image segmentation, prediction systems must provide reliability guarantees that extend beyond conventional expected loss control. While risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) offer probabilistic guarantees on the expected risk, they fail to capture tail behavior and worst-case scenarios that are crucial in high-stakes settings. This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate. Experiments on image segmentation demonstrate that OCE-RCPS consistently meets target satisfaction rates across various risk measures and reliability configurations, while OCE-CRC fails to provide probabilistic guarantees.</p></details> | Sumitted to EUSIPCO |

Prior work on referring image grounding focuses on categorical and spatial queries (e.g., "left-most apple") and overlooks functional and physical reasoning (e.g., "where can I safely store the knife?"). We address this gap and introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and ConverSeg, a benchmark spanning entities, spatial relations, intent, affordances, functions, safety, and physical reasoning. We also present ConverSeg-Net, which fuses strong segmentation priors with language understanding, and an AI-powered data engine that generates prompt-mask pairs without human supervision. We show that current language-guided segmentation models are inadequate for CIS, while ConverSeg-Net trained on our data engine achieves significant gains on ConverSeg and maintains strong performance on existing language-guided segmentation benchmarks.

It enables dense scene understanding without human annotations, which is especially valuable in domains where labelled data is scarce. However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO. With its modular design, strong generalization, and minimal computational footprint, DynaGuide offers a scalable and practical solution for unsupervised segmentation in real-world settings.

Despite existing applications of deep learning in land use monitoring, standard convolutional kernels in deep neural networks limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we designed a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery to acquire insights into socio-economic indicators. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention Network. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). A region adjacency graph (RAG) is then constructed where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA outperform graph and non-graph baselines on Asia14 and C2D2 datasets efficiently.</p></details> |  |

However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI), 2026</p></details> |

This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy.

Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by the rapid progress of large language models (LLMs), we investigate how the superior linguistic understanding and broad world knowledge of LLMs can further strengthen CLIP, particularly in handling long and complex captions. We introduce an efficient fine-tuning framework that embeds an LLM into a pretrained CLIP while incurring nearly the same training cost as standard CLIP fine-tuning. Our method first converts the LLM into an embedding-compatible form for the CLIP setting, and then couples it with the pretrained CLIP vision encoder through a lightweight adaptor trained on only a few million image-caption pairs. With this strategy, we achieve large performance gains without large-scale retraining, outperforming state-of-the-art CLIP variants such as EVA02 and SigLIP-2. The LLM-enhanced CLIP delivers consistent improvements across a wide range of downstream tasks, including linear-probe classification, zero-shot image-text retrieval with both short and long captions (in English and other languages), zero-shot and supervised image segmentation, object detection, and serving as a tokenizer backbone for multimodal large-model benchmarks.

To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals from multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.54\% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of LMM-based agentic frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voxel Densification for Serialized 3D Object Detection: Mitigating Sparsity via Pre-serialization Expansion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16069v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs) to capture long-range dependencies. However, these serialized frameworks strictly maintain the consistency of input and output voxel dimensions, inherently lacking the capability for voxel expansion. This limitation hinders performance, as expanding the voxel set is known to significantly enhance detection accuracy, particularly for sparse foreground objects. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel Voxel Densification Module (VDM). Unlike standard convolutional stems, VDM is explicitly designed to promote pre-serialization spatial expansion. It leverages sparse 3D convolutions to propagate foreground semantics to neighboring empty voxels, effectively densifying the feature representation before it is flattened into a sequence. Simultaneously, VDM incorporates residual sparse blocks to aggregate fine-grained local context, ensuring rich geometric feature extraction. To balance the computational overhead of increased voxel density, we introduce a strategic cascaded downsampling mechanism. We integrate VDM into both Transformer-based (DSVT) and SSM-based (LION) detectors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VDM consistently improves detection accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Specifically, our method achieves 74.8 mAPH (L2) on the Waymo validation set and 70.5 mAP on the nuScenes test set. Furthermore, it attains 42.6 mAP on the Argoverse 2 validation set and 67.6 mAP on the ONCE validation set, consistently outperforming the baseline models. The source code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/qifeng22/VDM.</p></details> | Under review |

To reduce annotation dependency, unsupervised and sparsely-supervised paradigms have emerged. However, they face intertwined challenges: low-quality pseudo-labels, unstable feature mining, and a lack of a unified training framework. This paper proposes SPL, a unified training framework for both Unsupervised and Sparsely-Supervised 3D Object Detection via Semantic Pseudo-labeling and prototype Learning. SPL first generates high-quality pseudo-labels by integrating image semantics, point cloud geometry, and temporal cues, producing both 3D bounding boxes for dense objects and 3D point labels for sparse ones. These pseudo-labels are not used directly but as probabilistic priors within a novel, multi-stage prototype learning strategy. This strategy stabilizes feature representation learning through memory-based initialization and momentum-based prototype updating, effectively mining features from both labeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that SPL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both settings. Our work provides a robust and generalizable solution for learning 3D object detectors with minimal or no manual annotations.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we present empirical results on low-precision emulation for image classification and object detection using published datasets, illustrating the sensitivity of the use of low precision and offering valuable insights into its impact.

While Detection Transformers (DETR) have demonstrated significant performance improvements, current real-time DETR models are challenging to reproduce from scratch due to excessive pre-training overheads on the backbone, constraining research advancements by hindering the exploration of novel backbone architectures. In this paper, we want to show that by using general good design, it is possible to have \textbf{high performance} with \textbf{low pre-training cost}. After a thorough study of the backbone architecture, we propose EfficientNAT at various scales, which incorporates modern efficient convolution and local attention mechanisms. Moreover, we re-design the hybrid encoder with local attention, significantly enhancing both performance and inference speed. Based on these advancements, we present Le-DETR (\textbf{L}ow-cost and \textbf{E}fficient \textbf{DE}tection \textbf{TR}ansformer), which achieves a new \textbf{SOTA} in real-time detection using only ImageNet1K and COCO2017 training datasets, saving about 80\% images in pre-training stage compared with previous methods. We demonstrate that with well-designed, real-time DETR models can achieve strong performance without the need for complex and computationally expensive pretraining. Extensive experiments show that Le-DETR-M/L/X achieves \textbf{52.9/54.3/55.1 mAP} on COCO Val2017 with \textbf{4.45/5.01/6.68 ms} on an RTX4090. It surpasses YOLOv12-L/X by \textbf{+0.6/-0.1 mAP} while achieving similar speed and \textbf{+20\%} speedup. Compared with DEIM-D-FINE, Le-DETR-M achieves \textbf{+0.2 mAP} with slightly faster inference, and surpasses DEIM-D-FINE-L by \textbf{+0.4 mAP} with only \textbf{0.4 ms} additional latency. Code and weights will be open-sourced.</p></details> | CVPR Findings |

We introduce Evolving World Object Detection (EWOD), a paradigm coupling incremental learning, domain adaptation, and unknown detection under exemplar-free constraints. To tackle EWOD, we propose EW-DETR framework that augments DETR-based detectors with three synergistic modules: Incremental LoRA Adapters for exemplar-free incremental learning under evolving domains; a Query-Norm Objectness Adapter that decouples objectness-aware features from DETR decoder queries; and Entropy-Aware Unknown Mixing for calibrated unknown detection. This framework generalises across DETR-based detectors, enabling state-of-the-art RF-DETR to operate effectively in evolving-world settings. We also introduce FOGS (Forgetting, Openness, Generalisation Score) to holistically evaluate performance across these dimensions. Extensive experiments on Pascal Series and Diverse Weather benchmarks show EW-DETR outperforms other methods, improving FOGS by 57.24%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2026</p></details> |
| **[FLIM Networks with Bag of Feature Points](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20845v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional networks require extensive image annotation, which can be costly and time-consuming. Feature Learning from Image Markers (FLIM) tackles this challenge by estimating encoder filters (i.e., kernel weights) from user-drawn markers on discriminative regions of a few representative images without traditional optimization. Such an encoder combined with an adaptive decoder comprises a FLIM network fully trained without backpropagation. Prior research has demonstrated their effectiveness in Salient Object Detection (SOD), being significantly lighter than existing lightweight models. This study revisits FLIM SOD and introduces FLIM-Bag of Feature Points (FLIM-BoFP), a considerably faster filter estimation method. The previous approach, FLIM-Cluster, derives filters through patch clustering at each encoder's block, leading to computational overhead and reduced control over filter locations. FLIM-BoFP streamlines this process by performing a single clustering at the input block, creating a bag of feature points, and defining filters directly from mapped feature points across all blocks. The paper evaluates the benefits in efficiency, effectiveness, and generalization of FLIM-BoFP compared to FLIM-Cluster and other state-of-the-art baselines for parasite detection in optical microscopy images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 28th Iberoamerican Congress on Pattern Recognition (CIARP 2025).

However, the inherent sparsity and noise of radar point clouds present significant challenges for accurate 3D object detection, underscoring the need for effective and robust point clouds densification. Despite recent progress, existing densification methods often fail to address the extreme sparsity of 4D radar point clouds and exhibit limited robustness when processing scenes with a small number of points. In this paper, we propose SD4R, a novel framework that transforms sparse radar point clouds into dense representations. SD4R begins by utilizing a foreground point generator (FPG) to mitigate noise propagation and produce densified point clouds. Subsequently, a logit-query encoder (LQE) enhances conventional pillarization, resulting in robust feature representations. Through these innovations, our SD4R demonstrates strong capability in both noise reduction and foreground point densification. Extensive experiments conducted on the publicly available View-of-Delft dataset demonstrate that SD4R achieves state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Boosting Instance Awareness via Cross-View Correlation with 4D Radar and Camera for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20632v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>4D millimeter-wave radar has emerged as a promising sensing modality for autonomous driving due to its robustness and affordability. However, its sparse and weak geometric cues make reliable instance activation difficult, limiting the effectiveness of existing radar-camera fusion paradigms. BEV-level fusion offers global scene understanding but suffers from weak instance focus, while perspective-level fusion captures instance details but lacks holistic context. To address these limitations, we propose SIFormer, a scene-instance aware transformer for 3D object detection using 4D radar and camera. SIFormer first suppresses background noise during view transformation through segmentation- and depth-guided localization. It then introduces a cross-view activation mechanism that injects 2D instance cues into BEV space, enabling reliable instance awareness under weak radar geometry. Finally, a transformer-based fusion module aggregates complementary image semantics and radar geometry for robust perception. As a result, with the aim of enhancing instance awareness, SIFormer bridges the gap between the two paradigms, combining their complementary strengths to address inherent sparse nature of radar and improve detection accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that SIFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on View-of-Delft, TJ4DRadSet and NuScenes datasets.

| **[Object-Scene-Camera Decomposition and Recomposition for Data-Efficient Monocular 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20627v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is intrinsically ill-posed, hence training a high-performance deep learning based M3OD model requires a humongous amount of labeled data with complicated visual variation from diverse scenes, variety of objects and camera poses.However, we observe that, due to strong human bias, the three independent entities, i.e., object, scene, and camera pose, are always tightly entangled when an image is captured to construct training data. More specifically, specific 3D objects are always captured in particular scenes with fixed camera poses, and hence lacks necessary diversity. Such tight entanglement induces the challenging issues of insufficient utilization and overfitting to uniform training data. To mitigate this, we propose an online object-scene-camera decomposition and recomposition data manipulation scheme to more efficiently exploit the training data. We first fully decompose training images into textured 3D object point models and background scenes in an efficient computation and storage manner. We then continuously recompose new training images in each epoch by inserting the 3D objects into the freespace of the background scenes, and rendering them with perturbed camera poses from textured 3D point representation. In this way, the refreshed training data in all epochs can cover the full spectrum of independent object, scene, and camera pose combinations. This scheme can serve as a plug-and-play component to boost M3OD models, working flexibly with both fully and sparsely supervised settings. In the sparsely-supervised setting, objects closest to the ego-camera for all instances are sparsely annotated. We then can flexibly increase the annotated objects to control annotation cost. For validation, our method is widely applied to five representative M3OD models and evaluated on both the KITTI and the more complicated Waymo datasets.</p></details> | IJCV |
| **[Knowing the Unknown: Interpretable Open-World Object Detection via Concept Decomposition Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20616v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-world object detection (OWOD) requires incrementally detecting known categories while reliably identifying unknown objects. Existing methods primarily focus on improving unknown recall, yet overlook interpretability, often leading to known-unknown confusion and reduced prediction reliability. This paper aims to make the entire OWOD framework interpretable, enabling the detector to truly "knowing the unknown". To this end, we propose a concept-driven InterPretable OWOD framework(IPOW) by introducing a Concept Decomposition Model (CDM) for OWOD, which explicitly decomposes the coupled RoI features in Faster R-CNN into discriminative, shared, and background concepts. Discriminative concepts identify the most discriminative features to enlarge the distances between known categories, while shared and background concepts, due to their strong generalization ability, can be readily transferred to detect unknown categories. Leveraging the interpretable framework, we identify that known-unknown confusion arises when unknown objects fall into the discriminative space of known classes. To address this, we propose Concept-Guided Rectification (CGR) to further resolve such confusion. Extensive experiments show that IPOW significantly improves unknown recall while mitigating confusion, and provides concept-level interpretability for both known and unknown predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unbiased Object Detection Beyond Frequency with Visually Prompted Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18229v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a generation-based debiasing framework for object detection. Prior debiasing methods are often limited by the representation diversity of samples, while naive generative augmentation often preserves the biases it aims to solve. Moreover, our analysis reveals that simply generating more data for rare classes is suboptimal due to two core issues: i) instance frequency is an incomplete proxy for the true data needs of a model, and ii) current layout-to-image synthesis lacks the fidelity and control to generate high-quality, complex scenes. To overcome this, we introduce the representation score (RS) to diagnose representational gaps beyond mere frequency, guiding the creation of new, unbiased layouts. To ensure high-quality synthesis, we replace ambiguous text prompts with a precise visual blueprint and employ a generative alignment strategy, which fosters communication between the detector and generator. Our method significantly narrows the performance gap for underrepresented object groups, \eg, improving large/rare instances by 4.4/3.6 mAP over the baseline, and surpassing prior L2I synthesis models by 15.9 mAP for layout accuracy in generated images.</p></details> |  |

We present Sim2Radar, an end-to-end framework that synthesizes training radar data directly from single-view RGB images, enabling scalable data generation without manual scene modeling. Sim2Radar reconstructs a material-aware 3D scene by combining monocular depth estimation, segmentation, and vision-language reasoning to infer object materials, then simulates mmWave propagation with a configurable physics-based ray tracer using Fresnel reflection models parameterized by ITU-R electromagnetic properties. Evaluated on real-world indoor scenes, Sim2Radar improves downstream 3D radar perception via transfer learning: pre-training a radar point-cloud object detection model on synthetic data and fine-tuning on real radar yields up to +3.7 3D AP (IoU 0.3), with gains driven primarily by improved spatial localization. These results suggest that physics-based, vision-driven radar simulation can provide effective geometric priors for radar learning and measurably improve performance under limited real-data supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Efficient LiDAR-Camera Fusion Network for Multi-Class 3D Dynamic Object Detection and Trajectory Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13647v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. To further advance the practical application of service robots in complex dynamic environments, we propose an efficient multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction, which synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space.The framework incorporates two novel models: 1) a Unified modality detector with Mamba and Transformer (UniMT) for object detection, which achieves high-accuracy object detection with fast inference speed, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of multi-class objects with flexible-length trajectories. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms existing ones in both detection (+3.71\% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE$_5$ of pedestrians) metrics. Furthermore, on the challenging nuScenes detection benchmark, our detection model achieves competitive performance among LiDAR-camera fusion methods, with a mAP of 72.7\% and NDS of 75.3\%. Remarkably, the system demonstrates exceptional generalizability and practical deployment potential. When transferred and implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA RTX 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.9 frames per second (FPS) with satisfactory accuracy. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at \href{https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception}{https://github.com/TossherO/3D\_Perception} and its ROS inference version at \href{https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages}{https://github.com/TossherO/ros\_packages}.</p></details> |  |
| **[RADE-Net: Robust Attention Network for Radar-Only Object Detection in Adverse Weather](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19994v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automotive perception systems are obligated to meet high requirements. While optical sensors such as Camera and Lidar struggle in adverse weather conditions, Radar provides a more robust perception performance, effectively penetrating fog, rain, and snow. Since full Radar tensors have large data sizes and very few datasets provide them, most Radar-based approaches work with sparse point clouds or 2D projections, which can result in information loss. Additionally, deep learning methods show potential to extract richer and more dense features from low level Radar data and therefore significantly increase the perception performance. Therefore, we propose a 3D projection method for fast-Fourier-transformed 4D Range-Azimuth-Doppler-Elevation (RADE) tensors. Our method preserves rich Doppler and Elevation features while reducing the required data size for a single frame by 91.9% compared to a full tensor, thus achieving higher training and inference speed as well as lower model complexity. We introduce RADE-Net, a lightweight model tailored to 3D projections of the RADE tensor. The backbone enables exploitation of low-level and high-level cues of Radar tensors with spatial and channel-attention. The decoupled detection heads predict object center-points directly in the Range-Azimuth domain and regress rotated 3D bounding boxes from rich feature maps in the cartesian scene. We evaluate the model on scenes with multiple different road users and under various weather conditions on the large-scale K-Radar dataset and achieve a 16.7% improvement compared to their baseline, as well as 6.5% improvement over current Radar-only models. Additionally, we outperform several Lidar approaches in scenarios with adverse weather conditions.

Although more engineering is still needed, the evaluation demonstrates the potential of this solution: Iconclass-aware computer vision and recommendation methods can accelerate cataloging and enhance navigation in large heritage repositories. The key insight is to let computer vision propose visible elements and to use symbolic structures (Iconclass hierarchy) to reach meaning.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures; submitted to ICCS 2026 conference</p></details> |

This work presents a novel multimodal HRI framework that combines advanced vision-language models, speech processing, and fuzzy logic to enable precise and adaptive control of a Dobot Magician robotic arm. The proposed system integrates Florence-2 for object detection, Llama 3.1 for natural language understanding, and Whisper for speech recognition, providing users with a seamless and intuitive interface for object manipulation through spoken commands. By jointly addressing scene perception and action planning, the approach enhances the reliability of command interpretation and execution. Experimental evaluations conducted on consumer-grade hardware demonstrate a command execution accuracy of 75\%, highlighting both the robustness and adaptability of the system. Beyond its current performance, the proposed architecture serves as a flexible and extensible foundation for future HRI research, offering a practical pathway toward more sophisticated and natural human-robot collaboration through tightly coupled speech and vision-language processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint currently under revision</p></details> |
| **[Fore-Mamba3D: Mamba-based Foreground-Enhanced Encoding for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19536v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear modeling methods like Mamba have been merged as the effective backbone for the 3D object detection task. However, previous Mamba-based methods utilize the bidirectional encoding for the whole non-empty voxel sequence, which contains abundant useless background information in the scenes. Though directly encoding foreground voxels appears to be a plausible solution, it tends to degrade detection performance. We attribute this to the response attenuation and restricted context representation in the linear modeling for fore-only sequences. To address this problem, we propose a novel backbone, termed Fore-Mamba3D, to focus on the foreground enhancement by modifying Mamba-based encoder. The foreground voxels are first sampled according to the predicted scores. Considering the response attenuation existing in the interaction of foreground voxels across different instances, we design a regional-to-global slide window (RGSW) to propagate the information from regional split to the entire sequence. Furthermore, a semantic-assisted and state spatial fusion module (SASFMamba) is proposed to enrich contextual representation by enhancing semantic and geometric awareness within the Mamba model. Our method emphasizes foreground-only encoding and alleviates the distance-based and causal dependencies in the linear autoregression model. The superior performance across various benchmarks demonstrates the effectiveness of Fore-Mamba3D in the 3D object detection task.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Text-Guided Vision Model for Enhanced Recognition of Small Instances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.19503v1)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As drone-based object detection technology continues to evolve, the demand is shifting from merely detecting objects to enabling users to accurately identify specific targets. For example, users can input particular targets as prompts to precisely detect desired objects. To address this need, an efficient text-guided object detection model has been developed to enhance the detection of small objects. Specifically, an improved version of the existing YOLO-World model is introduced. The proposed method replaces the C2f layer in the YOLOv8 backbone with a C3k2 layer, enabling more precise representation of local features, particularly for small objects or those with clearly defined boundaries. Additionally, the proposed architecture improves processing speed and efficiency through parallel processing optimization, while also contributing to a more lightweight model design. Comparative experiments on the VisDrone dataset show that the proposed model outperforms the original YOLO-World model, with precision increasing from 40.6% to 41.6%, recall from 30.8% to 31%, F1 score from 35% to 35.5%, and mAP@0.5 from 30.4% to 30.7%, confirming its enhanced accuracy. Furthermore, the model demonstrates superior lightweight performance, with the parameter count reduced from 4 million to 3.8 million and FLOPs decreasing from 15.7 billion to 15.2 billion. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a practical and effective solution for precise object detection in drone-based applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Applied Computer Science (2026)</p></details> |
| **[Task-Oriented Computation Offloading for Edge Inference: An Integrated Bayesian Optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21090v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge intelligence (EI) allows resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) to offload computation-intensive AI tasks (e.g., visual object detection) to edge servers (ESs) for fast execution. However, transmitting high-volume raw task data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p), it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships. Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity. Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b) a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and 0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...

The proposed design enables dynamic reconfiguration between approximate and accurate modes, exploiting the latency-accuracy trade-off for a wide range of workloads. Its resource-efficient approach further enables up to 4x throughput improvement within the same hardware resources by leveraging vectorised, time-multiplexed execution and flexible precision scaling. With a time-multiplexed multi-AF block and a lightweight pooling and normalisation unit, the proposed vector engine supports flexible precision (4/8/16-bit) and high MAC density. The ASIC implementation results show that each MAC stage can save up to 33% of time and 21% of power, with a 256-PE configuration that achieves higher compute density (4.83 TOPS/mm2 ) and energy efficiency (11.67 TOPS/W) than previous state-of-the-art work. A detailed hardware-software co-design methodology for object detection and classification tasks on Pynq-Z2 is discussed to assess the proposed architecture, demonstrating a scalable, energy-efficient solution for edge AI applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundation Model Priors Enhance Object Focus in Feature Space for Source-Free Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17514v3)** | 2026-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art approaches in Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) typically rely on Mean-Teacher self-labeling. However, domain shift often reduces the detector's ability to maintain strong object-focused representations, causing high-confidence activations over background clutter. This weak object focus results in unreliable pseudo-labels from the detection head. While prior works mainly refine these pseudo-labels, they overlook the underlying need to strengthen the feature space itself. We propose FALCON-SFOD (Foundation-Aligned Learning with Clutter suppression and Noise robustness), a framework designed to enhance object-focused adaptation under domain shift. It consists of two complementary components. SPAR (Spatial Prior-Aware Regularization) leverages the generalization strength of vision foundation models to regularize the detector's feature space. Using class-agnostic binary masks derived from OV-SAM, SPAR promotes structured and foreground-focused activations by guiding the network toward object regions. IRPL (Imbalance-aware Noise Robust Pseudo-Labeling) complements SPAR by promoting balanced and noise-tolerant learning under severe foreground-background imbalance. Guided by a theoretical analysis that connects these designs to tighter localization and classification error bounds, FALCON-SFOD achieves competitive performance across SFOD benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2026</p></details> |

While open-vocabulary detectors built on vision-language models (VLMs) transfer well, they depend almost entirely on text prompts, which encode domain-invariant semantics but miss domain-specific visual information needed for precise localization under few-shot supervision. We propose a dual-branch detector that Learns Multi-modal Prototypes, dubbed LMP, by coupling textual guidance with visual exemplars drawn from the target domain. A Visual Prototype Construction module aggregates class-level prototypes from support RoIs and dynamically generates hard-negative prototypes in query images via jittered boxes, capturing distractors and visually similar backgrounds. In the visual-guided branch, we inject these prototypes into the detection pipeline with components mirrored from the text branch as the starting point for training, while a parallel text-guided branch preserves open-vocabulary semantics. The branches are trained jointly and ensembled at inference by combining semantic abstraction with domain-adaptive details. On six cross-domain benchmark datasets and standard 1/5/10-shot settings, our method achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive mAP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026 Findings</p></details> |

This paper benchmarks several YOLO architectures such as YOLOv5s, YOLOv8n/s/m, and YOLOv12n for flower object detection under two annotation regimes: single-image single-bounding box (SISBB) and single-image multiple-bounding box (SIMBB). The FloralSix dataset, comprising 2,816 high-resolution photos of six different flower species, is also introduced. It is annotated for both dense (clustered) and sparse (isolated) scenarios. The models were evaluated using Precision, Recall, and Mean Average Precision (mAP) at IoU thresholds of 0.5 (mAP@0.5) and 0.5-0.95 (mAP@0.5:0.95). In SISBB, YOLOv8m (SGD) achieved the best results with Precision 0.956, Recall 0.951, mAP@0.5 0.978, and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.865, illustrating strong accuracy in detecting isolated flowers. With mAP@0.5 0.934 and mAP@0.5:0.95 0.752, YOLOv12n (SGD) outperformed the more complicated SIMBB scenario, proving robustness in dense, multi-object detection. Results show how annotation density, IoU thresholds, and model size interact: recall-optimized models perform better in crowded environments, whereas precision-oriented models perform best in sparse scenarios. In both cases, the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer consistently performed better than alternatives. These density-sensitive sensors are helpful for non-destructive crop analysis, growth tracking, robotic pollination, and stress evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 7th International Conference on Trends in Computational and Cognitive Engineering (TCCE-2025)</p></details> |
| **[Self-Aware Object Detection via Degradation Manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18394v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detectors achieve strong performance under nominal imaging conditions but can fail silently when exposed to blur, noise, compression, adverse weather, or resolution changes. In safety-critical settings, it is therefore insufficient to produce predictions without assessing whether the input remains within the detector's nominal operating regime. We refer to this capability as self-aware object detection. We introduce a degradation-aware self-awareness framework based on degradation manifolds, which explicitly structure a detector's feature space according to image degradation rather than semantic content. Our method augments a standard detection backbone with a lightweight embedding head trained via multi-layer contrastive learning. Images sharing the same degradation composition are pulled together, while differing degradation configurations are pushed apart, yielding a geometrically organized representation that captures degradation type and severity without requiring degradation labels or explicit density modeling. To anchor the learned geometry, we estimate a pristine prototype from clean training embeddings, defining a nominal operating point in representation space. Self-awareness emerges as geometric deviation from this reference, providing an intrinsic, image-level signal of degradation-induced shift that is independent of detection confidence. Extensive experiments on synthetic corruption benchmarks, cross-dataset zero-shot transfer, and natural weather-induced distribution shifts demonstrate strong pristine-degraded separability, consistent behavior across multiple detector architectures, and robust generalization under semantic shift. These results suggest that degradation-aware representation geometry provides a practical and detector-agnostic foundation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Landmark Detection for Medical Images using a General-purpose Segmentation Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11551v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Radiographic images are a cornerstone of medical diagnostics in orthopaedics, with anatomical landmark detection serving as a crucial intermediate step for information extraction. General-purpose foundational segmentation models, such as SAM (Segment Anything Model), do not support landmark segmentation out of the box and require prompts to function. However, in medical imaging, the prompts for landmarks are highly specific. Since SAM has not been trained to recognize such landmarks, it cannot generate accurate landmark segmentations for diagnostic purposes. Even MedSAM, a medically adapted variant of SAM, has been trained to identify larger anatomical structures, such as organs and their parts, and lacks the fine-grained precision required for orthopaedic pelvic landmarks. To address this limitation, we propose leveraging another general-purpose, non-foundational model: YOLO. YOLO excels in object detection and can provide bounding boxes that serve as input prompts for SAM. While YOLO is efficient at detection, it is significantly outperformed by SAM in segmenting complex structures. In combination, these two models form a reliable pipeline capable of segmenting not only a small pilot set of eight anatomical landmarks but also an expanded set of 72 landmarks and 16 regions with complex outlines, such as the femoral cortical bone and the pelvic inlet. By using YOLO-generated bounding boxes to guide SAM, we trained the hybrid model to accurately segment orthopaedic pelvic radiographs. Our results show that the proposed combination of YOLO and SAM yields excellent performance in detecting anatomical landmarks and intricate outlines in orthopaedic pelvic radiographs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Learning Adaptive Pseudo-Label Selection for Semi-Supervised 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23880v2)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised 3D object detection (SS3DOD) aims to reduce costly 3D annotations utilizing unlabeled data. Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes. Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant SS3DOD methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2026</p></details> |

An Evaluation Across Models, Augmentation Ratios, and Dataset Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18525v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic images are increasingly used to augment object-detection training sets, but reliably evaluating a synthetic dataset before training remains difficult: standard global generative metrics (e.g., FID) often do not predict downstream detection mAP. We present a controlled evaluation of synthetic augmentation for YOLOv11 across three single-class detection regimes -- Traffic Signs (sparse/near-saturated), Cityscapes Pedestrian (dense/occlusion-heavy), and COCO PottedPlant (multi-instance/high-variability). We benchmark six GAN-, diffusion-, and hybrid-based generators over augmentation ratios from 10% to 150% of the real training split, and train YOLOv11 both from scratch and with COCO-pretrained initialization, evaluating on held-out real test splits (mAP@0.50:0.95). For each dataset-generator-augmentation configuration, we compute pre-training dataset metrics under a matched-size bootstrap protocol, including (i) global feature-space metrics in both Inception-v3 and DINOv2 embeddings and (ii) object-centric distribution distances over bounding-box statistics. Synthetic augmentation yields substantial gains in the more challenging regimes (up to +7.6% and +30.6% relative mAP in Pedestrian and PottedPlant, respectively) but is marginal in Traffic Signs and under pretrained fine-tuning. To separate metric signal from augmentation quantity, we report both raw and augmentation-controlled (residualized) correlations with multiple-testing correction, showing that metric-performance alignment is strongly regime-dependent and that many apparent raw associations weaken after controlling for augmentation level.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 13 figures, includes appendix</p></details> |
| **[Beyond the Encoder: Joint Encoder-Decoder Contrastive Pre-Training Improves Dense Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17526v3)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive learning methods in self-supervised settings have primarily focused on pre-training encoders, while decoders are typically introduced and trained separately for downstream dense prediction tasks. However, this conventional approach overlooks the potential benefits of jointly pre-training both encoder and decoder. In this paper, we propose DeCon, an efficient encoder-decoder self-supervised learning (SSL) framework that supports joint contrastive pre-training. We first extend existing SSL architectures to accommodate diverse decoders and their corresponding contrastive losses. Then, we introduce a weighted encoder-decoder contrastive loss with non-competing objectives to enable the joint pre-training of encoder-decoder architectures. By adapting a contrastive SSL framework for dense prediction, DeCon establishes consistent state-of-the-art performance on most of the evaluated tasks when pre-trained on Imagenet-1K, COCO and COCO+. Notably, when pre-training a ResNet-50 encoder on COCO dataset, DeCon improves COCO object detection and instance segmentation compared to the baseline framework by +0.37 AP and +0.32 AP, respectively, and boosts semantic segmentation by +1.42 mIoU on Pascal VOC and by +0.50 mIoU on Cityscapes. These improvements generalize across recent backbones, decoders, datasets, and dense tasks beyond segmentation and object detection, and persist in out-of-domain scenarios, including limited-data settings, demonstrating that joint pre-training significantly enhances representation quality for dense prediction.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a new RGB-Thermal RMOT task, named RT-RMOT, which aims to fuse RGB appearance features with the illumination robustness of the thermal modality to enable all-day referring multi-object tracking. To promote research on RT-RMOT, we construct the first Referring Multi-Object Tracking dataset under RGB-Thermal modality, named RefRT. It contains 388 language descriptions, 1,250 tracked targets, and 166,147 Language-RGB-Thermal (L-RGB-T) triplets. Furthermore, we propose RTrack, a framework built upon a multimodal large language model (MLLM) that integrates RGB, thermal, and textual features. Since the initial framework still leaves room for improvement, we introduce a Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO) strategy to further exploit the model's potential. To alleviate training instability during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a Clipped Advantage Scaling (CAS) strategy to suppress gradient explosion. In addition, we design Structured Output Reward and Comprehensive Detection Reward to balance exploration and exploitation, thereby improving the completeness and accuracy of target perception. Extensive experiments on the RefRT dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RTrack framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[RegTrack: Simplicity Beneath Complexity in Robust Multi-Modal 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00618v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often sacrifice efficiency and generalizability for robustness, largely relying on complex association metrics derived from multi-modal architectures and class-specific motion priors. Challenging the rooted belief that greater complexity necessarily yields greater robustness, we propose a robust, efficient, and generalizable method for multi-modal 3D MOT, dubbed RegTrack. Inspired by Yang-Mills gauge theory, RegTrack is built upon a unified tri-cue encoder (UTEnc), comprising three tightly coupled components: a local-global point cloud encoder (LG-PEnc), a mixture-of-experts-based geometry encoder (MoE-GEnc), and an image encoder from a well-pretrained visual-language model. LG-PEnc efficiently encodes the spatial and structural information of point clouds to produce foundational representations for each object, whose pairwise similarities serve as the sole association metric. MoE-GEnc seamlessly interacts with LG-PEnc to model inter-object geometric relationships across frames, adaptively compensating for inter-frame object motion without relying on any class-specific priors. The image encoder is kept frozen and is used exclusively during training to provide a well-pretrained representation space. Point cloud representations are aligned to this space to supervise the motion compensation process, encouraging representation invariance across frames for the same object while enhancing discriminability among different objects. Through this formulation, RegTrack attains robust, efficient, and generalizable inference using only point cloud inputs, requiring just 2.6M parameters. Extensive experiments on KITTI and nuScenes show that RegTrack outperforms its thirty-five competitors.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings, while neglecting 3D geometric cues, making them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to infer geometric cues from only a few 2D images. To address the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing. By leveraging null-space constraints during model updates, it incorporates geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated acknowledgements</p></details> |

We present a two-stage detection-tracking framework for stable multi-apple quality inspection in conveyor-belt environments. An orchard-trained YOLOv8 model performs apple localization, followed by ByteTrack multi-object tracking to maintain persistent identities. A ResNet18 defect classifier, fine-tuned on a healthy-defective fruit dataset, is applied to cropped apple regions. Track-level aggregation is introduced to enforce temporal consistency and reduce prediction oscillation across frames. We define video-level industrial metrics such as track-level defect ratio and temporal consistency to evaluate system robustness under realistic processing conditions. Results demonstrate improved stability compared to frame-wise inference, suggesting that integrating tracking is essential for practical automated fruit grading systems.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use the Fréchet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fréchet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[MUOT_3M: A 3 Million Frame Multimodal Underwater Benchmark and the MUTrack Tracking Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18006v1)** | 2026-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater Object Tracking (UOT) is crucial for efficient marine robotics, large scale ecological monitoring, and ocean exploration; however, progress has been hindered by the scarcity of large, multimodal, and diverse datasets. Existing benchmarks remain small and RGB only, limiting robustness under severe color distortion, turbidity, and low visibility conditions. We introduce MUOT_3M, the first pseudo multimodal UOT benchmark comprising 3 million frames from 3,030 videos (27.8h) annotated with 32 tracking attributes, 677 fine grained classes, and synchronized RGB, estimated enhanced RGB, estimated depth, and language modalities validated by a marine biologist. Building upon MUOT_3M, we propose MUTrack, a SAM-based multimodal to unimodal tracker featuring visual geometric alignment, vision language fusion, and four level knowledge distillation that transfers multimodal knowledge into a unimodal student model. Extensive evaluations across five UOT benchmarks demonstrate that MUTrack achieves up to 8.40% higher AUC and 7.80% higher precision than the strongest SOTA baselines while running at 24 FPS. MUOT_3M and MUTrack establish a new foundation for scalable, multimodally trained yet practically deployable underwater tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiMAP: History-aware Map-occupancy Prediction with Fallback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17231v1)** | 2026-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate motion forecasting is critical for autonomous driving, yet most predictors rely on multi-object tracking (MOT) with identity association, assuming that objects are correctly and continuously tracked. When tracking fails due to, e.g., occlusion, identity switches, or missed detections, prediction quality degrades and safety risks increase. We present \textbf{HiMAP}, a tracking-free, trajectory prediction framework that remains reliable under MOT failures. HiMAP converts past detections into spatiotemporally invariant historical occupancy maps and introduces a historical query module that conditions on the current agent state to iteratively retrieve agent-specific history from unlabeled occupancy representations. The retrieved history is summarized by a temporal map embedding and, together with the final query and map context, drives a DETR-style decoder to produce multi-modal future trajectories. This design lifts identity reliance, supports streaming inference via reusable encodings, and serves as a robust fallback when tracking is unavailable. On Argoverse~2, HiMAP achieves performance comparable to tracking-based methods while operating without IDs, and it substantially outperforms strong baselines in the no-tracking setting, yielding relative gains of 11\% in FDE, 12\% in ADE, and a 4\% reduction in MR over a fine-tuned QCNet. Beyond aggregate metrics, HiMAP delivers stable forecasts for all agents simultaneously without waiting for tracking to recover, highlighting its practical value for safety-critical autonomy.

Recently, naturalistic studies have used video data to capture the complex behavioural and infrastructural risk factors. A promising format is panoramic video, which can record 360$^\circ$ views around a rider. However, its use is limited by distortions, large numbers of small objects, and boundary continuity, which cannot be handled using existing computer vision models. This research proposes a novel three-step framework: (1) enhancing object detection accuracy on panoramic imagery by segmenting and projecting the original 360$^\circ$ images into sub-images; (2) modifying multi-object tracking models to incorporate boundary continuity and object category information; and (3) validating through a real-world application of vehicle overtaking detection. The methodology is evaluated using panoramic videos recorded by cyclists on London's roadways under diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate improvements over baselines, achieving higher average precision across varying image resolutions. Moreover, the enhanced tracking approach yields a 10.0% decrease in identification switches and a 2.7% improvement in identification precision. The overtaking detection task achieves a high F-score of 0.82, illustrating the practical effectiveness of the proposed method in real-world cycling safety scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Learn...</summary><p>Learning Model Adaptation for Adverse and Dynamic Environments</p></details> |

It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on this work, we achieved 1st place on the KITTI tracking leaderboard</p></details> |

Addressing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, especially under challenging conditions like unpredictable occlusion, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces LGTrack, a unified UAV tracking framework that integrates dynamic layer selection, efficient feature enhancement, and robust representation learning for occlusions. By employing a novel lightweight Global-Grouped Coordinate Attention (GGCA) module, LGTrack captures long-range dependencies and global contexts, enhancing feature discriminability with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, a lightweight Similarity-Guided Layer Adaptation (SGLA) module replaces knowledge distillation, achieving an optimal balance between tracking precision and inference efficiency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate LGTrack's state-of-the-art real-time speed (258.7 FPS on UAVDT) while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy (82.8\% precision).

| **[Detecting Object Tracking Failure via Sequential Hypothesis Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12983v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time online object tracking in videos constitutes a core task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications including video surveillance, motion capture, and robotics. Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV workshop "Real World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges, 6th"</p></details> |

To address these challenges, we propose Easy-Poly, a filter-based 3D MOT framework with four key innovations: (1) CNMSMM, a novel Camera-LiDAR fusion detection method combining multi-modal augmentation and an efficient NMS with a new loss function to improve small target detection; (2) Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association that robustly handles uncertainties and occlusions via class-aware optimal assignment and parallel processing strategies; (3) Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) using a confidence-weighted Kalman filter with adaptive noise covariance to enhance tracking accuracy; and (4) an extended life-cycle management system reducing identity switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 65.65% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 75.6%), while also running in real-time.

A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers.

| **[Beyond Vizing Chains: Improved Recourse in Dynamic Edge Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09497v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the maintenance of a $(Δ+C)$-edge-coloring ($C\ge 1$) in a fully dynamic graph $G$ with maximum degree $Δ$. We focus on minimizing \emph{recourse} which equals the number of recolored edges per edge updates. We present a new technique based on an object which we call a \emph{shift-tree}. This object tracks multiple possible recolorings of $G$ and enables us to maintain a proper coloring with small recourse in polynomial time. We shift colors over a path of edges, but unlike many other algorithms, we do not use \emph{fans} and \emph{alternating bicolored paths}. We combine the shift-tree with additional techniques to obtain an algorithm with a \emph{tight} recourse of $O\big( \frac{\log n}{\log \frac{Δ+C}{Δ-C}}\big)$ for all $C \ge 0.62Δ$ where $Δ-C = O(n^{1-δ})$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm to establish tight bounds for large palettes, and the first to do so when $Δ-C=o(Δ)$. This result settles the theoretical complexity of the recourse for large palettes. Furthermore, we believe that viewing the possible shifts as a tree can lead to similar tree-based techniques that extend to lower values of $C$, and to improved update times. A second application is to graphs with low arboricity $α$. Previous works [BCPS24, CRV24] achieve $O(ε^{-1}\log n)$ recourse per update with $C\ge (4+ε)α$, and we improve by achieving the same recourse while only requiring $C \ge (2+ε)α- 1$. This result is $Δ$-adaptive, i.e., it uses $Δ_t+C$ colors where $Δ_t$ is the current maximum degree. Trying to understand the limitations of our technique, and shift-based algorithms in general, we show a separation between the recourse achievable by algorithms that only shift colors along a path, and more general algorithms such as ones using the Nibbling Method [BGW21, BCPS24].</p></details> |  |

However, existing RMOT paradigms are largely designed for explicit instructions and consequently fail to generalize to complex instructions that require logical reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT), a novel task that requires models to identify and track targets that satisfy implicit constraints via logical reasoning. To advance this field, we construct the ReaMOT Challenge, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: (1) a large-scale dataset with 1,156 instructions categorized into High-Level Reasoning and Low-Level Perception, covering 423,359 image-language pairs across 869 diverse scenes; and (2) a tailored metric suite designed to jointly evaluate reasoning accuracy and tracking robustness. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework that synergizes the reasoning capabilities of Thinking-variant Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) with the precise temporal modeling of SAM2. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/chen-si-jia/ReaMOT</p></details> |

Specifically, changes in the scene background not only render traditional frame-to-frame object IoU association methods ineffective but also introduce significant view shifts in the objects, which complicates tracking. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel HomView-MOT framework, which for the first time, harnesses the view homography inherent in changing scenes to solve MOT challenges in moving environments, incorporating homographic matching and view-centric concepts. We introduce a Fast Homography Estimation (FHE) algorithm for rapid computation of homography matrices between video frames, enabling object View-Centric ID Learning (VCIL) and leveraging multi-view homography to learn cross-view ID features. Concurrently, our Homographic Matching Filter (HMF) maps object bounding boxes from different frames onto a common view plane for a more realistic physical IoU association. Extensive experiments have proven that these innovations allow HomView-MOT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent UAV MOT datasets VisDrone and UAVDT.</p></details> | TGRS 2026 |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a physical environment indirect prompt injection attack that exploits the multimodal language interpretation abilities of AI models. CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents: drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML).

This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04692v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/chen-si-jia/DRMOT</p></details> |

However, most existing systems depend on pre-scanned, static environments and rely heavily on continuous tracking or marker-based solutions, which limit adaptability in dynamic physical spaces. This is particularly problematic for AR headsets and glasses, which typically follow the user's head movement and cannot maintain a fixed, stationary view of the scene. Moreover, continuous scene observation is neither power-efficient nor practical for wearable devices, given their limited battery and processing capabilities. A persistent challenge arises when multiple identical objects are present in the environment-standard object tracking pipelines often fail to maintain consistent identities without uninterrupted observation or external sensors. These limitations hinder fluid physical-virtual interactions, especially in dynamic or occluded scenes where continuous tracking is infeasible. To address this, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for re-identifying identical objects in AR scenes using only one partial egocentric observation frame captured by a headset. We formulate the problem as a label assignment task solved via integer programming, augmented with a Voronoi diagram-based pruning strategy to improve computational efficiency. This method reduces computation time by 50% while preserving 91% accuracy in simulated experiments. Moreover, we evaluated our approach in quantitative synthetic and quantitative real-world experiments. We also conducted three qualitative real-world experiments to demonstrate the practical utility and generalizability for enabling dynamic, markerless object interaction in AR environments.

The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 7 figures, conference paper published in IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference 2025</p></details> |

Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures |
| **[OptiPMB: Enhancing 3D Multi-Object Tracking with Optimized Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12968v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enables robust perception, navigation, and planning in complex environments. While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods remain challenged in dynamic environments, where moving objects violate the static-world assumption and introduce inconsistent observations that degrade both camera tracking and map reconstruction. This motivates two fundamental problems: robustly identifying dynamic objects and modeling them online. To address these limitations, we propose CAD-SLAM, a Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM framework with dynamic-static decoupled mapping. Our key insight is that dynamic objects inherently violate cross-view and cross-time scene consistency. We detect object motion by analyzing geometric and texture discrepancies between historical map renderings and real-world observations. Once a moving object is identified, we perform bidirectional dynamic object tracking (both backward and forward in time) to achieve complete sequence-wise dynamic recognition. Our consistency-aware dynamic detection model achieves category-agnostic, instantaneous dynamic identification, which effectively mitigates motion-induced interference during localization and mapping. In addition, we introduce a dynamic-static decoupled mapping strategy that employs a temporal Gaussian model for online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate the flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities of our method, along with the state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  |

These difficulties are further exacerbated by the geometric distortion and extreme scale variation introduced by static fisheye cameras. In this work, we present GTATrack, a hierarchical tracking framework that win first place in the SoccerTrack Challenge 2025. GTATrack integrates two core components: Deep Expansion IoU (Deep-EIoU) for motion-agnostic online association and Global Tracklet Association (GTA) for trajectory-level refinement. This two-stage design enables both robust short-term matching and long-term identity consistency. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is used to boost detector recall on small and distorted targets. The synergy between local association and global reasoning effectively addresses identity switches, occlusions, and tracking fragmentation. Our method achieved a winning HOTA score of 0.60 and significantly reduced false positives to 982, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy in fisheye-based soccer tracking.

In few-shot NVS, where only a few input views are available, existing methods often assume equal importance for all input views relative to the target, leading to suboptimal results. We address this limitation by introducing a camera-weighting mechanism that adjusts the importance of source views based on their relevance to the target. We propose two approaches: a deterministic weighting scheme leveraging geometric properties like Euclidean distance and angular differences, and a cross-attention-based learning scheme that optimizes view weighting. Additionally, models can be further trained with our camera-weighting scheme to refine their understanding of view relevance and enhance synthesis quality. This mechanism is adaptable and can be integrated into various NVS algorithms, improving their ability to synthesize high-quality novel views. Our results demonstrate that adaptive view weighting enhances accuracy and realism, offering a promising direction for improving NVS.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICIP ...</summary><p>ICIP 2025 Workshop on Generative AI for World Simulations and Communications</p></details> |

Some require conceptual understanding for semantic synthesis, while others rely on localization cues for spatial precision. Forcing these heterogeneous tasks to share a single representation leads to concept`-`localization representational conflict. To address this issue, we propose CoLoGen, a unified diffusion framework that progressively learns and reconciles this concept`-`localization duality. CoLoGen uses a staged curriculum that first builds core conceptual and localization abilities, then adapts them to diverse visual conditions, and finally refines their synergy for complex instruction`-`driven tasks. Central to this process is the Progressive Representation Weaving (PRW) module, which dynamically routes features to specialized experts and stably integrates their outputs across stages. Experiments on editing, controllable generation, and customized generation show that CoLoGen achieves competitive or superior performance, offering a principled representational perspective for unified image generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR2026. 15 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |

Given their broad reach, it is critical to rigorously evaluate how these models portray the world. Existing diversity metrics either rely on curated datasets or focus on surface-level visual similarity, limiting interpretability. We introduce GeoDiv, a framework leveraging large language and vision-language models to assess geographical diversity along two complementary axes: the Socio-Economic Visual Index (SEVI), capturing economic and condition-related cues, and the Visual Diversity Index (VDI), measuring variation in primary entities and backgrounds. Applied to images generated by models such as Stable Diffusion and FLUX.1-dev across $10$ entities and $16$ countries, GeoDiv reveals a consistent lack of diversity and identifies fine-grained attributes where models default to biased portrayals. Strikingly, depictions of countries like India, Nigeria, and Colombia are disproportionately impoverished and worn, reflecting underlying socio-economic biases. These results highlight the need for greater geographical nuance in generative models. GeoDiv provides the first systematic, interpretable framework for measuring such biases, marking a step toward fairer and more inclusive generative systems.

The drift of the generative SDE is $\hat b_t(x) = \nablaφ(x)^\topη_t$, where $η_t\in\R^P$ solves a $P\times P$ system computable from data, with $P$ independent of the data dimension $d$. Since estimates are inexact, the diffusion coefficient $D_t$ affects sample quality; the optimal $D_t^*$ from Girsanov diverges at $t=0$, but this poses no difficulty and we develop an integrator that handles it seamlessly. The framework accommodates diverse feature maps -- scattering transforms, pretrained generative models etc. -- enabling training-free generation and model combination. We demonstrate the approach on financial time series, turbulence, and image generation.</p></details> |  |

This work investigates whether the estimated score function can be leveraged to compute higher-order differentials, namely the p-Laplace operators. We show that these operators can be employed to identify memorized training data. We propose a numerical p-Laplace approximation based on the learned score functions, showing its effectiveness in identifying key features of the probability landscape. Furthermore, theoretical error-bounds to these estimators are proven and demonstrated numerically. We analyze the structured case of Gaussian mixture models, and demonstrate that the results carry-over to text-conditioned image generative models (text-to-image), where memorization identification based on the p-Laplace operator is performed for the first time, showing its advantage on 500 memorized prompts ($\sim$3000 generated images) in a post-generation regime, especially when the conditioning text is unavailable.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is a substantially extended version of our SSVM 2025 paper, including significant new theoretical results and additional experiments.

| **[Unified Reward Model for Multimodal Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05236v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in human preference alignment have significantly improved multimodal generation and understanding. A key approach is to train reward models that provide supervision signals for preference optimization. However, existing reward models are often task-specific, limiting their adaptability across diverse visual applications. We also argue that a reward model that jointly learning to assess multiple vision tasks may foster a synergistic effect, where improved image understanding enhances image generation assessment, and refined image evaluation benefits video assessment through better frame analysis. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward, the first unified reward model for multimodal understanding and generation assessment. It supports both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, providing effective reward signals for vision model preference alignment. Specifically, (1) we first train UnifiedReward on our constructed large-scale human preference dataset, which covers both image and video generation/understanding tasks. (2) Then, we leverage it to automatically construct high-quality pairwise preference data from vision models by progressively filtering their outputs through our two-stage strategy, i.e., pair ranking and point sifting. (3) Finally, we use these data to align vision models with human preferences via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results show that jointly learning to assess diverse visual tasks yields substantial mutual benefits. We further apply our pipeline to both vision understanding and generation, achieving consistent improvements across each domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/</p></details> |

Nevertheless, they still suffer from the sparse reward problem: the terminal reward of the entire denoising trajectory is applied to all intermediate steps, resulting in a mismatch between the global feedback signals and the exact fine-grained contributions at intermediate denoising steps. To address this issue, we introduce \textbf{DenseGRPO}, a novel framework that aligns human preference with dense rewards, which evaluates the fine-grained contribution of each denoising step. Specifically, our approach includes two key components: (1) we propose to predict the step-wise reward gain as dense reward of each denoising step, which applies a reward model on the intermediate clean images via an ODE-based approach. This manner ensures an alignment between feedback signals and the contributions of individual steps, facilitating effective training; and (2) based on the estimated dense rewards, a mismatch drawback between the uniform exploration setting and the time-varying noise intensity in existing GRPO-based methods is revealed, leading to an inappropriate exploration space. Thus, we propose a reward-aware scheme to calibrate the exploration space by adaptively adjusting a timestep-specific stochasticity injection in the SDE sampler, ensuring a suitable exploration space at all timesteps. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed DenseGRPO and highlight the critical role of the valid dense rewards in flow matching model alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, we find that leading MLLMs and specialist OCR models largely fail to perceive these structural anomalies, creating a critical bottleneck for both VTR evaluation and RL-based optimization. As a result, even state-of-the-art generators (e.g., SeedDream4.0, Qwen-Image) still struggle to render structurally faithful text. To address this, we propose TextPecker, a plug-and-play structural anomaly perceptive RL strategy that mitigates noisy reward signals and works with any textto-image generator. To enable this capability, we construct a recognition dataset with character-level structural-anomaly annotations and develop a stroke-editing synthesis engine to expand structural-error coverage. Experiments show that TextPecker consistently improves diverse text-to-image models; even on the well-optimized Qwen-Image, it significantly yields average gains of 4% in structural fidelity and 8.7% in semantic alignment for Chinese text rendering, establishing a new state-of-the-art in high-fidelity VTR. Our work fills a gap in VTR optimization, providing a foundational step towards reliable and structural faithful visual text generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2026; Code: https://github.com/CIawevy/TextPecker</p></details> |

In this work, we present the first systematic study of these embeddings and uncover a notable redundancy: class-conditioned embeddings exhibit extreme angular similarity, exceeding 99\% on ImageNet-1K, while continuous-condition tasks such as pose-guided image generation and video-to-audio generation reach over 99.9\%. We further find that semantic information is concentrated in a small subset of dimensions, with head dimensions carrying the dominant signal and tail dimensions contributing minimally. By pruning low-magnitude dimensions--removing up to two-thirds of the embedding space--we show that generation quality and fidelity remain largely unaffected, and in some cases improve. These results reveal a semantic bottleneck in Transformer-based diffusion models, providing new insights into how semantics are encoded and suggesting opportunities for more efficient conditioning mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

In this work, we present Twin-Co, a framework that leverages synchronized, co-adaptive dialogue to progressively refine image generation. Instead of a static generation process, Twin-Co employs a dynamic, iterative workflow where an intelligent dialogue agent continuously interacts with the user. Initially, a base image is generated from the user's prompt. Then, through a series of synchronized dialogue exchanges, the system adapts and optimizes the image according to evolving user feedback. The co-adaptive process allows the system to progressively narrow down ambiguities and better align with user intent. Experiments demonstrate that Twin-Co not only enhances user experience by reducing trial-and-error iterations but also improves the quality of the generated images, streamlining creative process across various applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Denoising Diffusion Models via Simultaneous Estimation of Image and Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17167v2)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces two key contributions aimed at improving the speed and quality of images generated through inverse diffusion processes. The first contribution involves reparameterizing the diffusion process in terms of the angle on a quarter-circular arc between the image and noise, specifically setting the conventional $\displaystyle \sqrt{\barα}=\cos(η)$. This reparameterization eliminates two singularities and allows for the expression of diffusion evolution as a well-behaved ordinary differential equation (ODE). In turn, this allows higher order ODE solvers such as Runge-Kutta methods to be used effectively. The second contribution is to directly estimate both the image ($\mathbf{x}_0$) and noise ($\mathbfε$) using our network, which enables more stable calculations of the update step in the inverse diffusion steps, as accurate estimation of both the image and noise are crucial at different stages of the process. Together with these changes, our model achieves faster generation, with the ability to converge on high-quality images more quickly, and higher quality of the generated images, as measured by metrics such as Frechet Inception Distance (FID), spatial Frechet Inception Distance (sFID), precision, and recall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 15th Asian Conference on Machine Learning, PMLR 222:1638-1653, 2024</p></details> |
| **[XtraLight-MedMamba for Classification of Neoplastic Tubular Adenomas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04819v3)** | 2026-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.</p></details> | 14 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Provably Safe Generative Sampling with Constricting Barrier Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21429v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-based generative models, such as diffusion models and flow matching models, have achieved remarkable success in learning complex data distributions. However, a critical gap remains for their deployment in safety-critical domains: the lack of formal guarantees that generated samples will satisfy hard constraints. We address this by proposing a safety filtering framework that acts as an online shield for any pre-trained generative model. Our key insight is to cooperate with the generative process rather than override it. We define a constricting safety tube that is relaxed at the initial noise distribution and progressively tightens to the target safe set at the final data distribution, mirroring the coarse-to-fine structure of the generative process itself. By characterizing this tube via Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we synthesize a feedback control input through a convex Quadratic Program (QP) at each sampling step. As the tube is loosest when noise is high and intervention is cheapest in terms of control energy, most constraint enforcement occurs when it least disrupts the model's learned structure. We prove that this mechanism guarantees safe sampling while minimizing the distributional shift from the original model at each sampling step, as quantified by the KL divergence. Our framework applies to any pre-trained flow-based generative scheme requiring no retraining or architectural modifications. We validate the approach across constrained image generation, physically-consistent trajectory sampling, and safe robotic manipulation policies, achieving 100% constraint satisfaction while preserving semantic fidelity.</p></details> | 25 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Progressive Checkerboards for Autoregressive Multiscale Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03811v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A key challenge in autoregressive image generation is to efficiently sample independent locations in parallel, while still modeling mutual dependencies with serial conditioning. Some recent works have addressed this by conditioning between scales in a multiscale pyramid. Others have looked at parallelizing samples in a single image using regular partitions or randomized orders. In this work we examine a flexible, fixed ordering based on progressive checkerboards for multiscale autoregressive image generation. Our ordering draws samples in parallel from evenly spaced regions at each scale, maintaining full balance in all levels of a quadtree subdivision at each step. This enables effective conditioning both between and within scales. Intriguingly, we find evidence that in our balanced setting, a wide range of scale-up factors lead to similar results, so long as the total number of serial steps is constant. On class-conditional ImageNet, our method achieves competitive performance compared to recent state-of-the-art autoregressive systems with like model capacity, using fewer sampling steps.</p></details> |  |
| **[RelA-Diffusion: Relativistic Adversarial Diffusion for Multi-Tracer PET Synthesis from Multi-Sequence MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21345v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-tracer positron emission tomography (PET) provides critical insights into diverse neuropathological processes such as tau accumulation, neuroinflammation, and $β$-amyloid deposition in the brain, making it indispensable for comprehensive neurological assessment. However, routine acquisition of multi-tracer PET is limited by high costs, radiation exposure, and restricted tracer availability. Recent efforts have explored deep learning approaches for synthesizing PET images from structural MRI. While some methods rely solely on T1-weighted MRI, others incorporate additional sequences such as T2-FLAIR to improve pathological sensitivity. However, existing methods often struggle to capture fine-grained anatomical and pathological details, resulting in artifacts and unrealistic outputs. To this end, we propose RelA-Diffusion, a Relativistic Adversarial Diffusion framework for multi-tracer PET synthesis from multi-sequence MRI. By leveraging both T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR scans as complementary inputs, RelA-Diffusion captures richer structural information to guide image generation. To improve synthesis fidelity, we introduce a gradient-penalized relativistic adversarial loss to the intermediate clean predictions of the diffusion model. This loss compares real and generated images in a relative manner, encouraging the synthesis of more realistic local structures. Both the relativistic formulation and the gradient penalty contribute to stabilizing the training, while adversarial feedback at each diffusion timestep enables consistent refinement throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments on two datasets demonstrate that RelA-Diffusion outperforms existing methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics, highlighting its potential for accurate synthesis of multi-tracer PET.</p></details> |  |

However, modern supervised deep-learning perception models require large datasets for robust automation under semi-uncontrolled conditions. The cost of acquiring and annotating such data for proprietary parts is a major barrier for widespread deployment. In this context, we release SynthRender, an open source framework for synthetic image generation with Guided Domain Randomization capabilities. Furthermore, we benchmark recent Reality-to-Simulation techniques for 3D asset creation from 2D images of real parts. Combined with Domain Randomization, these synthetic assets provide low-overhead, transferable data even for parts lacking 3D files. We also introduce IRIS, the Industrial Real-Sim Imagery Set, containing 32 categories with diverse textures, intra-class variation, strong inter-class similarities and about 20,000 labels. Ablations on multiple benchmarks outline guidelines for efficient data generation with SynthRender. Our method surpasses existing approaches, achieving 99.1% mAP@50 on a public robotics dataset, 98.3% mAP@50 on an automotive benchmark, and 95.3% mAP@50 on IRIS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional Vision-Language Alignment by Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17028v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language alignment is crucial for various downstream tasks such as cross-modal generation and retrieval. Previous multimodal approaches like CLIP utilize InfoNCE to maximize mutual information, primarily aligning pairwise samples across modalities while overlooking distributional differences. In addition, InfoNCE has inherent conflict in terms of alignment and uniformity in multimodality, leading to suboptimal alignment with modality gaps. To overcome the limitations, we propose CS-Aligner, a novel framework that performs distributional vision-language alignment by integrating Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence with mutual information. CS-Aligner captures both the global distribution information of each modality and the pairwise semantic relationships. We find that the CS divergence seamlessly addresses the InfoNCE's alignment-uniformity conflict and serves complementary roles with InfoNCE, yielding tighter and more precise alignment. Moreover, by introducing distributional alignment, CS-Aligner enables incorporating additional information from unpaired data and token-level representations, enhancing flexible and fine-grained alignment in practice. Experiments on text-to-image generation and cross-modality retrieval tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on vision-language alignment.</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2026 |
| **[Bridging Physically Based Rendering and Diffusion Models with Stochastic Differential Equation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20725v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image generators excel at producing realistic content from text or image conditions, but they offer only limited explicit control over low-level, physically grounded shading and material properties. In contrast, physically based rendering (PBR) offers fine-grained physical control but lacks prompt-driven flexibility. Although these two paradigms originate from distinct communities, both share a common evolution -- from noisy observations to clean images. In this paper, we propose a unified stochastic formulation that bridges Monte Carlo rendering and diffusion-based generative modeling. First, a general stochastic differential equation (SDE) formulation for Monte Carlo integration under the Central Limit Theorem is modeled. Through instantiation via physically based path tracing, we convert it into a physically grounded SDE representation. Moreover, we provide a systematic analysis of how the physical characteristics of path tracing can be extended to existing diffusion models from the perspective of noise variance. Extensive experiments across multiple tasks show that our method can exert physically grounded control over diffusion-generated results, covering tasks such as rendering and material editing.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Vanishing Watermarks: Diffusion-Based Image Editing Undermines Robust Invisible Watermarking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20680v1)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust invisible watermarking schemes aim to embed hidden information into images such that the watermark survives common manipulations. However, powerful diffusion-based image generation and editing techniques now pose a new threat to these watermarks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical analysis demonstrating that diffusion models can effectively erase robust watermarks even when those watermarks were designed to withstand conventional distortions. We show that a diffusion-driven image regeneration process, which leverages generative models to recreate an image, can remove embedded watermarks while preserving the image's perceptual content. Furthermore, we introduce a guided diffusion-based attack that explicitly targets the embedded watermark signal during generation, significantly degrading watermark detectability. Theoretically, we prove that as an image undergoes sufficient diffusion transformations, the mutual information between the watermarked image and the hidden payload approaches zero, leading to inevitable decoding failure. Experimentally, we evaluate multiple state-of-the-art watermarking methods (including deep learning-based schemes like StegaStamp, TrustMark, and VINE) and demonstrate that diffusion edits yield near-zero watermark recovery rates after attack, while maintaining high visual fidelity of the regenerated images. Our findings reveal a fundamental vulnerability in current robust watermarking techniques against generative model-based edits, underscoring the need for new strategies to ensure watermark resilience in the era of powerful diffusion models.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[CRAFT-LoRA: Content-Style Personalization via Rank-Constrained Adaptation and Training-Free Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18936v2)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalized image generation requires effectively balancing content fidelity with stylistic consistency when synthesizing images based on text and reference examples. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers an efficient personalization approach, with potential for precise control through combining LoRA weights on different concepts. However, existing combination techniques face persistent challenges: entanglement between content and style representations, insufficient guidance for controlling elements' influence, and unstable weight fusion that often require additional training. We address these limitations through CRAFT-LoRA, with complementary components: (1) rank-constrained backbone fine-tuning that injects low-rank projection residuals to encourage learning decoupled content and style subspaces; (2) a prompt-guided approach featuring an expert encoder with specialized branches that enables semantic extension and precise control through selective adapter aggregation; and (3) a training-free, timestep-dependent classifier-free guidance scheme that enhances generation stability by strategically adjusting noise predictions across diffusion steps. Our method significantly improves content-style disentanglement, enables flexible semantic control over LoRA module combinations, and achieves high-fidelity generation without additional retraining overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[PCPO: Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization for Aligning Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25774v3)** | 2026-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While reinforcement learning has advanced the alignment of text-to-image (T2I) models, state-of-the-art policy gradient methods are still hampered by training instability and high variance, hindering convergence speed and compromising image quality. Our analysis identifies a key cause of this instability: disproportionate credit assignment, in which the mathematical structure of the generative sampler produces volatile and non-proportional feedback across timesteps. To address this, we introduce Proportionate Credit Policy Optimization (PCPO), a framework that enforces proportional credit assignment through a stable objective reformulation and a principled reweighting of timesteps. This correction stabilizes the training process, leading to significantly accelerated convergence and superior image quality. The improvement in quality is a direct result of mitigating model collapse, a common failure mode in recursive training. PCPO substantially outperforms existing policy gradient baselines on all fronts, including the state-of-the-art DanceGRPO.

However, (1) existing benchmarks lack the diversity of prompt scenarios and multilingual support, both essential for real-world applicability; (2) they offer only coarse evaluations across primary dimensions, covering a narrow range of sub-dimensions, and fall short in fine-grained sub-dimension assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce UniGenBench++, a unified semantic assessment benchmark for T2I generation. Specifically, it comprises 600 prompts organized hierarchically to ensure both coverage and efficiency: (1) spans across diverse real-world scenarios, i.e., 5 main prompt themes and 20 subthemes; (2) comprehensively probes T2I models' semantic consistency over 10 primary and 27 sub evaluation criteria, with each prompt assessing multiple testpoints. To rigorously assess model robustness to variations in language and prompt length, we provide both English and Chinese versions of each prompt in short and long forms. Leveraging the general world knowledge and fine-grained image understanding capabilities of a closed-source Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM), i.e., Gemini-2.5-Pro, an effective pipeline is developed for reliable benchmark construction and streamlined model assessment. Moreover, to further facilitate community use, we train a robust evaluation model that enables offline assessment of T2I model outputs. Through comprehensive benchmarking of both open- and closed-sourced T2I models, we systematically reveal their strengths and weaknesses across various aspects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: codegoat24.github.io/UniGenBench/</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Pluggable Pruning with Contiguous Layer Distillation (PPCL), a flexible structured pruning framework specifically designed for DiT architectures. First, we identify redundant layer intervals through a linear probing mechanism combined with the first-order differential trend analysis of similarity metrics. Subsequently, we propose a plug-and-play teacher-student alternating distillation scheme tailored to integrate depth-wise and width-wise pruning within a single training phase. This distillation framework enables flexible knowledge transfer across diverse pruning ratios, eliminating the need for per-configuration retraining. Extensive experiments on multiple Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer architecture models demonstrate that PPCL achieves a 50\% reduction in parameter count compared to the full model, with less than 3\% degradation in key objective metrics. Notably, our method maintains high-quality image generation capabilities while achieving higher compression ratios, rendering it well-suited for resource-constrained environments. The open-source code, checkpoints for PPCL can be found at the following link: https://github.com/OPPO-Mente-Lab/Qwen-Image-Pruning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |

Many existing methods tackle these issues by heavily relying on text-based negative prompts or extensively retraining DMs to eliminate certain features or samples. In this paper, we take a radically different approach, directly modifying the sampling trajectory by leveraging a negation set (e.g., unsafe images, copyrighted data, or datapoints needed to be excluded) to avoid specific regions of data distribution, without needing to retrain or fine-tune DMs. We formally derive the relationship between the expected denoised samples that are safe and those that are not safe, leading to our $\textit{safe}$ denoiser which ensures its final samples are away from the area to be negated. Inspired by the derivation, we develop a practical algorithm that successfully produces high-quality samples while avoiding negation areas of the data distribution in text-conditional, class-conditional, and unconditional image generation scenarios. These results hint at the great potential of our training-free safe denoiser for using DMs more safely.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS2025, Code: https://github.com/MingyuKim87/Safe_Denoiser</p></details> |

However, existing image generation models still generally struggle with a spatial reasoning dilemma, lacking the ability to accurately capture fine-grained spatial relationships from the prompt and correctly generate scenes with structural integrity. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose RL-RIG, a Reinforcement Learning framework for Reflection-based Image Generation. Our architecture comprises four primary components: Diffuser, Checker, Actor, and Inverse Diffuser, following a Generate-Reflect-Edit paradigm to spark the Chain of Thought reasoning ability in image generation for addressing the dilemma. To equip the model with better intuition over generation trajectories, we further develop Reflection-GRPO to train the VLM Actor for edit prompts and the Image Editor for better image quality under a given prompt, respectively. Unlike traditional approaches that solely produce visually stunning yet structurally unreasonable content, our evaluation metrics prioritize spatial accuracy, utilizing Scene Graph IoU and employing a VLM-as-a-Judge strategy to assess the spatial consistency of generated images on LAION-SG dataset. Experimental results show that RL-RIG outperforms existing state-of-the-art open-source models by up to 11% in terms of controllable and precise spatial reasoning in image generation.</p></details> |  |

Traditional simulation methods, such as phase-field models, offer high-fidelity results but are computationally expensive due to the need to solve complex partial differential equations at fine spatiotemporal resolutions. To address this challenge, we propose a deep learning-based framework that accelerates microstructure evolution predictions while maintaining high accuracy. Our approach utilizes a fully convolutional spatiotemporal model trained in a self-supervised manner using sequential images generated from simulations of microstructural processes, including grain growth and spinodal decomposition. The trained neural network effectively learns the underlying physical dynamics and can accurately capture both short-term local behaviors and long-term statistical properties of evolving microstructures, while also demonstrating generalization to unseen spatiotemporal domains and variations in configuration and material parameters. Compared to recurrent neural architectures, our model achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance with significantly reduced computational cost in both training and inference. This work establishes a robust baseline for spatiotemporal learning in materials science and offers a scalable, data-driven alternative for fast and reliable microstructure simulations.</p></details> | 24 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Generative Neural Video Compression via Video Diffusion Prior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05016v2)** | 2026-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GNVC-VD, the first DiT-based generative neural video compression framework built upon an advanced video generation foundation model, where spatio-temporal latent compression and sequence-level generative refinement are unified within a single codec. Existing perceptual codecs primarily rely on pre-trained image generative priors to restore high-frequency details, but their frame-wise nature lacks temporal modeling and inevitably leads to perceptual flickering. To address this, GNVC-VD introduces a unified flow-matching latent refinement module that leverages a video diffusion transformer to jointly enhance intra- and inter-frame latents through sequence-level denoising, ensuring consistent spatio-temporal details. Instead of denoising from pure Gaussian noise as in video generation, GNVC-VD initializes refinement from decoded spatio-temporal latents and learns a correction term that adapts the diffusion prior to compression-induced degradation. A conditioning adaptor further injects compression-aware cues into intermediate DiT layers, enabling effective artifact removal while maintaining temporal coherence under extreme bitrate constraints. Extensive experiments show that GNVC-VD surpasses both traditional and learned codecs in perceptual quality and significantly reduces the flickering artifacts that persist in prior generative approaches, even below 0.01 bpp, highlighting the promise of integrating video-native generative priors into neural codecs for next-generation perceptual video compression.</p></details> | accept by CVPR2026 |

However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |

Recent disentanglement approaches attempt to solve this utilizing manual guidance, such as linguistic cues or segmentation masks, which limits their applicability and fails to fully articulate the target concept. In this paper, we propose ConceptPrism, a novel framework that automatically disentangles the shared visual concept from image-specific residuals by comparing images within a set. Our method jointly optimizes a target token and image-wise residual tokens using two complementary objectives: a reconstruction loss to ensure fidelity, and a novel exclusion loss that compels residual tokens to discard the shared concept. This process allows the target token to capture the pure concept without direct supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConceptPrism effectively resolves concept entanglement, achieving a significantly improved trade-off between fidelity and alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |
