| **[Performance Analysis of NOMA-Assisted Optical OFDM ISAC Systems with Clipping Distortion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02282v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the performance of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Due to their inherent high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), OFDM waveforms are clipped to fit the limited dynamic range of the optical transmitters (e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs)), resulting in clipping distortion. To alleviate the impact of the distortion, we propose a novel transmitter architecture where the clipping processes are performed before NOMA superposition coding. We then analyze the performance of the proposed optical ISAC systems considering the effects of power allocation and clipping distortion. For the communication subsystem, we analyze the effect of NOMA on the achievable sum rate and bit error rate (BER). For the sensing subsystem, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of estimating the transmission distance accuracy are obtained. Simulation results reveal that allocating more power to the strong user yields a higher sum rate, lower BER, and better sensing performance, whereas a more balanced power allocation among users results in degraded BER and sensing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Natural Gradient Fine-Tuning of CLIP Models via Kalman Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01694v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, have established new benchmarks in multimodal data mining. In such models, few-shot fine-tuning is a major challenge to achieve optimal performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, especially when labeled data is scarce. Most existing fine-tuning approaches rely on first-order gradient-based optimizers, which typically suffer from slow convergence, sensitivity to step-size hyperparameters, and poor generalization in OOD settings. In contrast, second-order methods utilize local curvature information of the loss landscape to adjust the update step size. This is particularly beneficial for CLIP models, whose non-convex loss functions often contain sharp critical points. In such cases, natural gradient direction can offer more substantial and efficient per-iteration updates when fine-tuning with limited data. Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) is obtained by preconditioning the standard gradient with the inverse Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which is computationally expensive for large models. To address this, we propose a Bayesian approximation of NGD using a Kalman filter for CLIP models. Our method combines the benefits of second-order optimization with Bayesian inference, which enhances generalization while providing uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse image classification datasets demonstrate that our algorithm consistently achieves superior--or comparable--ID performance and improved OOD robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful application of Kalman filtering to fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which enables more robust and efficient learning in vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegDebias: Test-Time Bias Mitigation for ViT-Based CLIP via Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00523v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in zero shot classification, but remain susceptible to spurious correlations, where irrelevant visual features influence predictions. Existing debiasing methods often require access to training data and explicit group labels to perform fine-tuning or adjust embeddings, which limits their practicality in real-world settings. Test-time methods attempt to avoid this constraint, but many still depend on prior knowledge of dataset specific biases, limiting their generalizability in open set settings. In this work, we propose a test-time debiasing method for ViT based CLIP models that requires no additional training or assumptions of bias annotations. Our approach uses a pretrained segmentation model to isolate the target visual attribute, then adjusts the non target regions so that their embeddings are uniformly similar to all class specific text prompts. This procedure removes unintended bias signals from confounding visual regions while preserving the target attribute. Experiments on Waterbirds and CelebA show that our method outperforms existing test-time debiasing approaches in both group robustness metrics and Attention IoU. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation guided interventions for scalable and annotation free bias mitigation in vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToxicTextCLIP: Text-Based Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on CLIP Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00446v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale web data through self-supervised contrastive learning. Yet, its reliance on uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses.

| **[AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 32nd International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling</p></details> |
| **[GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22319v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jingw193.github.io/GRPO-Guard/</p></details> |
| **[Adapter-state Sharing CLIP for Parameter-efficient Multimodal Sarcasm Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04508v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses challenges for opinion mining systems. Existing approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large models, making them unsuitable to adapt under resource-constrained settings. While recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS-CLIP (Adapter-state Sharing in CLIP), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in the upper layers to preserve low-level unimodal representations in the lower layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where textual adapters guide visual ones to promote efficient cross-modal learning in the upper layers. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS-CLIP not only outperforms standard PEFT methods but also existing multimodal baselines with significantly fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Caption-Driven Explainability: Probing CNNs for Bias via CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22035v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.

| **[SAGE: Structure-Aware Generative Video Transitions between Diverse Clips](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24667v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips, but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques (cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows, distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code to be released on acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://kan32501.github.io/sage.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Compositional Awareness in CLIP with Efficient Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24424v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our models and code are available at https://clic-compositional-clip.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification with CLIP and Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24321v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does CLIP perceive art the same way we do?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05229v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP has emerged as a powerful multimodal model capable of connecting images and text through joint embeddings, but to what extent does it 'see' the same way humans do - especially when interpreting artworks? In this paper, we investigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic information from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated imagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene understanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual deformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing CLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its alignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings reveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations, particularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further discuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance mechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based image synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in multimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance and subjectivity play a central role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14), partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under peer review</p></details> |
| **[A Training-Free Framework for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation and Recognition with EfficientNet and CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19333v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage, pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment. Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[VITRIX-CLIPIN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[BrainMCLIP: Brain Image Decoding with Multi-Layer feature Fusion of CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19332v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18927v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i) an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions; and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP Adapter for Domain Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21808v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Frame-Difference Guided Dynamic Region Perception for CLIP Adaptation in Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21806v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[CLIP: Client-Side Invariant Pruning for Mitigating Stragglers in Secure Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16694v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed model training. However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13% to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Compositional Reasoning in CLIP via Reconstruction and Alignment of Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16540v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale, enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Theoretical Refinement of CLIP by Utilizing Linear Structure of Optimal Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15508v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI. We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across several retrieval and classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FG-CLIP 2: A Bilingual Fine-grained Vision-Language Alignment Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10921v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Learning with Unpaired Clips for Instruction-based Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14648v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-GPPO: Coordinating Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for State Space Coverage in Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17830v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) enables agents to autonomously acquire diverse behaviors, but faces major challenges in visual environments due to high-dimensional, semantically sparse observations. In the online setting, where agents learn representations while exploring, the latent space evolves with the agent's policy, to capture newly discovered areas of the environment. However, without incentivization to maximize state coverage in the representation, classical approaches based on auto-encoders may converge to latent spaces that over-represent a restricted set of states frequently visited by the agent. This is exacerbated in an intrinsic motivation setting, where the agent uses the distribution encoded in the latent space to sample the goals it learns to master. To address this issue, we propose to progressively enforce distributional shifts towards a uniform distribution over the full state space, to ensure a full coverage of skills that can be learned in the environment. We introduce DRAG (Distributionally Robust Auto-Encoding for GCRL), a method that combines the $\beta$-VAE framework with Distributionally Robust Optimization. DRAG leverages an adversarial neural weighter of training states of the VAE, to account for the mismatch between the current data distribution and unseen parts of the environment. This allows the agent to construct semantically meaningful latent spaces beyond its immediate experience. Our approach improves state space coverage and downstream control performance on hard exploration environments such as mazes and robotic control involving walls to bypass, without pre-training nor prior environment knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[MemSearcher: Training LLMs to Reason, Search and Manage Memory via End-to-End Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02805v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical search agents concatenate the entire interaction history into the LLM context, preserving information integrity but producing long, noisy contexts, resulting in high computation and memory costs. In contrast, using only the current turn avoids this overhead but discards essential information. This trade-off limits the scalability of search agents. To address this challenge, we propose MemSearcher, an agent workflow that iteratively maintains a compact memory and combines the current turn with it. At each turn, MemSearcher fuses the user's question with the memory to generate reasoning traces, perform search actions, and update memory to retain only information essential for solving the task. This design stabilizes context length across multi-turn interactions, improving efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. To optimize this workflow, we introduce multi-context GRPO, an end-to-end RL framework that jointly optimize reasoning, search strategies, and memory management of MemSearcher Agents. Specifically, multi-context GRPO samples groups of trajectories under different contexts and propagates trajectory-level advantages across all conversations within them. Trained on the same dataset as Search-R1, MemSearcher achieves significant improvements over strong baselines on seven public benchmarks: +11% on Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct and +12% on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct relative average gains. Notably, the 3B-based MemSearcher even outperforms 7B-based baselines, demonstrating that striking a balance between information integrity and efficiency yields both higher accuracy and lower computational overhead. The code and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/icip-cas/MemSearcher</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/icip-cas/MemSearcher</p></details> |
| **[From Solo to Symphony: Orchestrating Multi-Agent Collaboration with Single-Agent Demos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02762v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training a team of agents from scratch in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is highly inefficient, much like asking beginners to play a symphony together without first practicing solo. Existing methods, such as offline or transferable MARL, can ease this burden, but they still rely on costly multi-agent data, which often becomes the bottleneck. In contrast, solo experiences are far easier to obtain in many important scenarios, e.g., collaborative coding, household cooperation, and search-and-rescue. To unlock their potential, we propose Solo-to-Collaborative RL (SoCo), a framework that transfers solo knowledge into cooperative learning. SoCo first pretrains a shared solo policy from solo demonstrations, then adapts it for cooperation during multi-agent training through a policy fusion mechanism that combines an MoE-like gating selector and an action editor. Experiments across diverse cooperative tasks show that SoCo significantly boosts the training efficiency and performance of backbone algorithms. These results demonstrate that solo demonstrations provide a scalable and effective complement to multi-agent data, making cooperative learning more practical and broadly applicable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlling Performance and Budget of a Centralized Multi-agent LLM System with Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02755v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit complementary strengths across domains and come with varying inference costs, motivating the design of multi-agent LLM systems where specialized models collaborate efficiently. Existing approaches predominantly rely on decentralized frameworks, which invoke multiple LLMs for every input and thus lead to substantial and uncontrolled inference costs. In this work, we introduce a centralized multi-LLM framework, where a controller LLM selectively coordinates a pool of expert models in a cost-efficient and cost-controllable manner. We formulate this coordination problem as reinforcement learning with dual objectives: maximizing task performance while minimizing the overall inference cost. In addition, we expect the multi-agent system to have adapted behavior with different budget conditions during inference. To this end, we propose CoRL, a reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the performance cost trade-off in a controllable multi-budget setting. Experiments on four diverse benchmarks demonstrate that CoRL enables a single system to surpass the best expert LLM under high-budget settings, while maintaining strong performance in more economical low-budget modes, highlighting the effectiveness of centralized coordination for scalable and cost-efficient multi-agent LLM systems.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Noise-based reward-modulated learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23972v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pursuit of energy-efficient and adaptive artificial intelligence (AI) has positioned neuromorphic computing as a promising alternative to conventional computing. However, achieving learning on these platforms requires techniques that prioritize local information while enabling effective credit assignment. Here, we propose noise-based reward-modulated learning (NRL), a novel synaptic plasticity rule that mathematically unifies reinforcement learning and gradient-based optimization with biologically-inspired local updates. NRL addresses the computational bottleneck of exact gradients by approximating them through stochastic neural activity, transforming the inherent noise of biological and neuromorphic substrates into a functional resource. Drawing inspiration from biological learning, our method uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and eligibility traces to facilitate retrospective credit assignment. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks, featuring immediate and delayed rewards, shows that NRL achieves performance comparable to baselines optimized using backpropagation, although with slower convergence, while showing significantly superior performance and scalability in multi-layer networks compared to reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL), the most prominent similar approach. While tested on simple architectures, the results highlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power adaptive systems, particularly in computing substrates with locality constraints. NRL offers a theoretically grounded paradigm well-suited for the event-driven characteristics of next-generation neuromorphic AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[VidEmo: Affective-Tree Reasoning for Emotion-Centric Video Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02712v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and predicting emotion from videos has gathered significant attention in recent studies, driven by advancements in video large language models (VideoLLMs). While advanced methods have made progress in video emotion analysis, the intrinsic nature of emotions poses significant challenges. Emotions are characterized by dynamic and cues-dependent properties, making it difficult to understand complex and evolving emotional states with reasonable rationale. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel affective cues-guided reasoning framework that unifies fundamental attribute perception, expression analysis, and high-level emotional understanding in a stage-wise manner. At the core of our approach is a family of video emotion foundation models (VidEmo), specifically designed for emotion reasoning and instruction-following. These models undergo a two-stage tuning process: first, curriculum emotion learning for injecting emotion knowledge, followed by affective-tree reinforcement learning for emotion reasoning. Moreover, we establish a foundational data infrastructure and introduce a emotion-centric fine-grained dataset (Emo-CFG) consisting of 2.1M diverse instruction-based samples. Emo-CFG includes explainable emotional question-answering, fine-grained captions, and associated rationales, providing essential resources for advancing emotion understanding tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance, setting a new milestone across 15 face perception tasks.</p></details> | 41 pages, 26 figures |
| **[Curriculum Design for Trajectory-Constrained Agent: Compressing Chain-of-Thought Tokens in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02690v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training agents to operate under strict constraints during deployment, such as limited resource budgets or stringent safety requirements, presents significant challenges, especially when these constraints render the task complex. In this work, we propose a curriculum learning strategy that gradually tightens constraints during training, enabling the agent to incrementally master the deployment requirements. Inspired by self-paced learning techniques in unconstrained reinforcement learning (RL), our approach facilitates a smoother transition to challenging environments by initially training on simplified versions of the constraints and progressively introducing the full deployment conditions. We provide a theoretical analysis using an RL agent in a binary-tree Markov Decision Process (MDP) to demonstrate that our curriculum strategy can accelerate training relative to a baseline approach that imposes the trajectory constraints from the outset. Moreover, we empirically validate the effectiveness and generality of our method across both RL and large language model (LLM) agents in diverse settings, including a binary-tree MDP, a multi-task navigation domain, and a math reasoning task with two benchmarks. These results highlight the potential of curriculum design in enhancing the efficiency and performance of agents operating under complex trajectory constraints during deployment. Moreover, when applied to LLMs, our strategy enables compression of output chain-of-thought tokens, achieving a substantial inference speedup on consumer hardware, demonstrating its effectiveness for resource-constrained deployment.</p></details> | NeurIPS'25 paper |
| **[Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08039v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[RL-Aided Cognitive ISAC: Robust Detection and Sensing-Communication Trade-offs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02672v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-aided cognitive framework for massive MIMO-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing a uniform planar array (UPA). The focus is on enhancing radar sensing performance in environments with unknown and dynamic disturbance characteristics. A Wald-type detector is employed for robust target detection under non-Gaussian clutter, while a SARSA-based RL algorithm enables adaptive estimation of target positions without prior environmental knowledge. Based on the RL-derived sensing information, a joint waveform optimization strategy is formulated to balance radar sensing accuracy and downlink communication throughput. The resulting design provides an adaptive trade-off between detection performance and achievable sum rate through an analytically derived closed-form solution. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the proposed cognitive ISAC framework achieves significantly improved detection probability compared to orthogonal and non-learning adaptive baselines, while maintaining competitive communication performance. These results underline the potential of RL-assisted sensing for robust and spectrum-efficient ISAC in next-generation wireless networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 14 figures.

| **[FELA: A Multi-Agent Evolutionary System for Feature Engineering of Industrial Event Log Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25223v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events, represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However, the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods, often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA (Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate, and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated, interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world environments.</p></details> | 14 pages, 11 figures |

Traditional methods, such as Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Key Frame Based (KFB) routines, either require extensive fine-tuning or lack real-time adaptability. This paper introduces FRASA, a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that integrates fall recovery and stand up strategies into a unified framework. Leveraging the Cross-Q algorithm, FRASA significantly reduces training time and offers a versatile recovery strategy that adapts to unpredictable disturbances. Comparative tests on Sigmaban humanoid robots demonstrate FRASA superior performance against the KFB method deployed in the RoboCup 2023 by the Rhoban Team, world champion of the KidSize League.</p></details> |  |
| **[Extended Friction Models for the Physics Simulation of Servo Actuators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08650v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate physical simulation is crucial for the development and validation of control algorithms in robotic systems. Recent works in Reinforcement Learning (RL) take notably advantage of extensive simulations to produce efficient robot control. State-of-the-art servo actuator models generally fail at capturing the complex friction dynamics of these systems. This limits the transferability of simulated behaviors to real-world applications. In this work, we present extended friction models that allow to more accurately simulate servo actuator dynamics. We propose a comprehensive analysis of various friction models, present a method for identifying model parameters using recorded trajectories from a pendulum test bench, and demonstrate how these models can be integrated into physics engines. The proposed friction models are validated on four distinct servo actuators and tested on 2R manipulators, showing significant improvements in accuracy over the standard Coulomb-Viscous model. Our results highlight the importance of considering advanced friction effects in the simulation of servo actuators to enhance the realism and reliability of robotic simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural-gas storage modelling by deep reinforcement learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02646v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce GasRL, a simulator that couples a calibrated representation of the natural gas market with a model of storage-operator policies trained with deep reinforcement learning (RL). We use it to analyse how optimal stockpile management affects equilibrium prices and the dynamics of demand and supply. We test various RL algorithms and find that Soft Actor Critic (SAC) exhibits superior performance in the GasRL environment: multiple objectives of storage operators - including profitability, robust market clearing and price stabilisation - are successfully achieved. Moreover, the equilibrium price dynamics induced by SAC-derived optimal policies have characteristics, such as volatility and seasonality, that closely match those of real-world prices. Remarkably, this adherence to the historical distribution of prices is obtained without explicitly calibrating the model to price data. We show how the simulator can be used to assess the effects of EU-mandated minimum storage thresholds. We find that such thresholds have a positive effect on market resilience against unanticipated shifts in the distribution of supply shocks. For example, with unusually large shocks, market disruptions are averted more often if a threshold is in place.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, published on</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive GR(1) Specification Repair for Liveness-Preserving Shielding in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02605v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shielding is widely used to enforce safety in reinforcement learning (RL), ensuring that an agent's actions remain compliant with formal specifications. Classical shielding approaches, however, are often static, in the sense that they assume fixed logical specifications and hand-crafted abstractions. While these static shields provide safety under nominal assumptions, they fail to adapt when environment assumptions are violated. In this paper, we develop the first adaptive shielding framework - to the best of our knowledge - based on Generalized Reactivity of rank 1 (GR(1)) specifications, a tractable and expressive fragment of Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) that captures both safety and liveness properties. Our method detects environment assumption violations at runtime and employs Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) to automatically repair GR(1) specifications online, in a systematic and interpretable way. This ensures that the shield evolves gracefully, ensuring liveness is achievable and weakening goals only when necessary. We consider two case studies: Minepump and Atari Seaquest; showing that (i) static symbolic controllers are often severely suboptimal when optimizing for auxiliary rewards, and (ii) RL agents equipped with our adaptive shield maintain near-optimal reward and perfect logical compliance compared with static shields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaffolded Language Models with Language Supervision for Mixed-Autonomy: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16392v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This survey organizes the intricate literature on the design and optimization of emerging structures around post-trained LMs. We refer to this overarching structure as scaffolded LMs and focus on LMs that are integrated into multi-step processes with tools. We view scaffolded LMs as semi-parametric models wherein we train non-parametric variables, including the prompt, tools, and scaffold's code. In particular, they interpret instructions, use tools, and receive feedback all in language. Recent works use an LM as an optimizer to interpret language supervision and update non-parametric variables according to intricate objectives. In this survey, we refer to this paradigm as training of scaffolded LMs with language supervision. A key feature of non-parametric training is the ability to learn from language. Parametric training excels in learning from demonstration (supervised learning), exploration (reinforcement learning), or observations (unsupervised learning), using well-defined loss functions. Language-based optimization enables rich, interpretable, and expressive objectives, while mitigating issues like catastrophic forgetting and supporting compatibility with closed-source models. Furthermore, agents are increasingly deployed as co-workers in real-world applications such as Copilot in Office tools or software development. In these mixed-autonomy settings, where control and decision-making are shared between human and AI, users point out errors or suggest corrections. Accordingly, we discuss agents that continuously improve by learning from this real-time, language-based feedback and refer to this setting as streaming learning from language supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional-Clamp PPO](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02577v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is widely regarded as one of the most successful deep reinforcement learning algorithms, known for its robustness and effectiveness across a range of problems. The PPO objective encourages the importance ratio between the current and behavior policies to move to the "right" direction -- starting from importance sampling ratios equal to 1, increasing the ratios for actions with positive advantages and decreasing those with negative advantages. A clipping function is introduced to prevent over-optimization when updating the importance ratio in these "right" direction regions. Many PPO variants have been proposed to extend its success, most of which modify the objective's behavior by altering the clipping in the "right" direction regions. However, due to randomness in the rollouts and stochasticity of the policy optimization, we observe that the ratios frequently move to the "wrong" direction during the PPO optimization. This is a key factor hindering the improvement of PPO, but it has been largely overlooked. To address this, we propose the Directional-Clamp PPO algorithm (DClamp-PPO), which further penalizes the actions going to the strict "wrong" direction regions, where the advantage is positive (negative) and importance ratio falls below (above) $1 - \beta$ ($1+\beta$), for a tunable parameter $\beta \in (0, 1)$. The penalty is by enforcing a steeper loss slope, i.e., a clamp, in those regions. We demonstrate that DClamp-PPO consistently outperforms PPO, as well as its variants, by focusing on modifying the objective's behavior in the "right" direction, across various MuJoCo environments, using different random seeds. The proposed method is shown, both theoretically and empirically, to better avoid "wrong" direction updates while keeping the importance ratio closer to 1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Neighborhood-Constrained Q Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02567v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) suffers from extrapolation errors induced by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions. To address this, offline RL algorithms typically impose constraints on action selection, which can be systematically categorized into density, support, and sample constraints. However, we show that each category has inherent limitations: density and sample constraints tend to be overly conservative in many scenarios, while the support constraint, though least restrictive, faces challenges in accurately modeling the behavior policy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new neighborhood constraint that restricts action selection in the Bellman target to the union of neighborhoods of dataset actions. Theoretically, the constraint not only bounds extrapolation errors and distribution shift under certain conditions, but also approximates the support constraint without requiring behavior policy modeling. Moreover, it retains substantial flexibility and enables pointwise conservatism by adapting the neighborhood radius for each data point. In practice, we employ data quality as the adaptation criterion and design an adaptive neighborhood constraint. Building on an efficient bilevel optimization framework, we develop a simple yet effective algorithm, Adaptive Neighborhood-constrained Q learning (ANQ), to perform Q learning with target actions satisfying this constraint. Empirically, ANQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard offline RL benchmarks and exhibits strong robustness in scenarios with noisy or limited data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Optimal Fuel Consumption of HEVs under Observational Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20913v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint, assuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world scenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference speeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these imperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly incorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a robust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and employ a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using both the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC constraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel consumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly encountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC) applications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor text and figure adjustments; no substantive changes</p></details> |

Without explicit knowledge of those preferences, judging whether behaviour is appropriate becomes guesswork, leaving us highly prone to misinterpretation. Yet, such understanding is critical if autonomous agents are to collaborate effectively with humans. We frame the problem with multi-agent inverse reinforcement learning and show that even a simple model, where agents weigh their own welfare against that of others, can cover a wide range of social behaviours. Using novel Bayesian techniques, we find that intrinsic rewards and altruistic tendencies can be reliably identified by placing agents in different groups. Crucially, this disentanglement of intrinsic motivation from altruism enables the synthesis of new behaviours aligned with any desired level of altruism, even when demonstrations are drawn from restricted behaviour profiles.</p></details> | EWRL18 (2025) |

However, advancing this field faces two critical challenges. First, high-quality training data is scarce, especially data that reflects real-world SWE scenarios, where agents must interact with development environments, execute code and adapt behavior based on the outcomes of their actions. Existing datasets are either limited to one-shot code generation or comprise small, manually curated collections of interactive tasks, lacking both scale and diversity. Second, the lack of fresh interactive SWE tasks affects evaluation of rapidly improving models, as static benchmarks quickly become outdated due to contamination issues. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel, automated, and scalable pipeline to continuously extract real-world interactive SWE tasks from diverse GitHub repositories. Using this pipeline, we construct SWE-rebench, a public dataset comprising over 21,000 interactive Python-based SWE tasks, suitable for reinforcement learning of SWE agents at scale. Additionally, we use continuous supply of fresh tasks collected using SWE-rebench methodology to build a contamination-free benchmark for agentic software engineering. We compare results of various LLMs on this benchmark to results on SWE-bench Verified and show that performance of some language models might be inflated due to contamination issues.</p></details> | <details><summary>Datas...</summary><p>Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/nebius/SWE-rebench, SWE-rebench leaderboard https://swe-rebench.com NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In CLRPs, the complex constraints and the intricate relationships between various decisions make the problem challenging to solve. With the emergence of deep reinforcement learning (DRL), it has been extensively applied to address the vehicle routing problem and its variants, while the research related to CLRPs still needs to be explored. In this paper, we propose the DRL with heterogeneous query (DRLHQ) to solve CLRP and open CLRP (OCLRP), respectively. We are the first to propose an end-to-end learning approach for CLRPs, following the encoder-decoder structure. In particular, we reformulate the CLRPs as a markov decision process tailored to various decisions, a general modeling framework that can be adapted to other DRL-based methods. To better handle the interdependency across location and routing decisions, we also introduce a novel heterogeneous querying attention mechanism designed to adapt dynamically to various decision-making stages. Experimental results on both synthetic and benchmark datasets demonstrate superior solution quality and better generalization performance of our proposed approach over representative traditional and DRL-based baselines in solving both CLRP and OCLRP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overcoming Non-stationary Dynamics with Evidential Proximal Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01468v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous control of non-stationary environments is a major challenge for deep reinforcement learning algorithms. The time-dependency of the state transition dynamics aggravates the notorious stability problems of model-free deep actor-critic architectures. We posit that two properties will play a key role in overcoming non-stationarity in transition dynamics: (i)~preserving the plasticity of the critic network and (ii) directed exploration for rapid adaptation to changing dynamics. We show that performing on-policy reinforcement learning with an evidential critic provides both. The evidential design ensures a fast and accurate approximation of the uncertainty around the state value, which maintains the plasticity of the critic network by detecting the distributional shifts caused by changes in dynamics. The probabilistic critic also makes the actor training objective a random variable, enabling the use of directed exploration approaches as a by-product. We name the resulting algorithm \emph{Evidential Proximal Policy Optimization (EPPO)} due to the integral role of evidential uncertainty quantification in both policy evaluation and policy improvement stages. Through experiments on non-stationary continuous control tasks, where the environment dynamics change at regular intervals, we demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art on-policy reinforcement learning variants in both task-specific and overall return.</p></details> |  |

Bimanual robotic piano playing represents a particularly challenging task: it is high-dimensional, contact-rich, and requires fast, precise control. We present OmniPianist, the first agent capable of performing nearly one thousand music pieces via scalable, human-demonstration-free learning. Our approach is built on three core components. First, we introduce an automatic fingering strategy based on Optimal Transport (OT), allowing the agent to autonomously discover efficient piano-playing strategies from scratch without demonstrations. Second, we conduct large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL) by training more than 2,000 agents, each specialized in distinct music pieces, and aggregate their experience into a dataset named RP1M++, consisting of over one million trajectories for robotic piano playing. Finally, we employ a Flow Matching Transformer to leverage RP1M++ through large-scale imitation learning, resulting in the OmniPianist agent capable of performing a wide range of musical pieces. Extensive experiments and ablation studies highlight the effectiveness and scalability of our approach, advancing dexterous robotic piano playing at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Energy and Latency in 6G Smart Cities with Edge CyberTwins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00955v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of IoT devices in smart cities challenges 6G networks with conflicting energy-latency requirements across heterogeneous slices. Existing approaches struggle with the energy-latency trade-off, particularly for massive scale deployments exceeding 50,000 devices km. This paper proposes an edge-aware CyberTwin framework integrating hybrid federated learning for energy-latency co-optimization in 6G network slicing. Our approach combines centralized Artificial Intelligence scheduling for latency-sensitive slices with distributed federated learning for non-critical slices, enhanced by compressive sensing-based digital twins and renewable energy-aware resource allocation. The hybrid scheduler leverages a three-tier architecture with Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) based security attestation achieving 99.7% attack detection accuracy. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate 52% energy reduction for non-real-time slices compared to Diffusion-Reinforcement Learning baselines while maintaining 0.9ms latency for URLLC applications with 99.1% SLA compliance. The framework scales to 50,000 devices km with CPU overhead below 25%, validated through NS-3 hybrid simulations across realistic smart city scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, for open-ended tasks lacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction following), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios, thereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a key question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended tasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the open domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose the existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended tasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice Reformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended data into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even in the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM performance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks, our VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the baseline. Code will be released upon acceptance to facilitate reproducibility.</p></details> | 9 pages |

However, current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications. This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions, thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations. Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex chart comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, EMNLP25 Accepted</p></details> |

Focusing on multi-agent task allocation problems, we study this question from the perspective of reward design: what kinds of objectives are best suited for heterogeneous teams? We first consider an instantaneous, non-spatial setting where the global reward is built by two generalized aggregation operators: an inner operator that maps the $N$ agents' effort allocations on individual tasks to a task score, and an outer operator that merges the $M$ task scores into the global team reward. We prove that the curvature of these operators determines whether heterogeneity can increase reward, and that for broad reward families this collapses to a simple convexity test. Next, we ask what incentivizes heterogeneity to emerge when embodied, time-extended agents must learn an effort allocation policy. To study heterogeneity in such settings, we use multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) as our computational paradigm, and introduce Heterogeneity Gain Parameter Search (HetGPS), a gradient-based algorithm that optimizes the parameter space of underspecified MARL environments to find scenarios where heterogeneity is advantageous. Across different environments, we show that HetGPS rediscovers the reward regimes predicted by our theory to maximize the advantage of heterogeneity, both validating HetGPS and connecting our theoretical insights to reward design in MARL. Together, these results help us understand when behavioral diversity delivers a measurable benefit.</p></details> |  |

However, existing Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based multi-task methods can only train light decoder models on small-scale problems, exhibiting limited generalization ability when solving large-scale problems. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel multi-task learning method driven by knowledge distillation (MTL-KD), which enables the efficient training of heavy decoder models with strong generalization ability. The proposed MTL-KD method transfers policy knowledge from multiple distinct RL-based single-task models to a single heavy decoder model, facilitating label-free training and effectively improving the model's generalization ability across diverse tasks. In addition, we introduce a flexible inference strategy termed Random Reordering Re-Construction (R3C), which is specifically adapted for diverse VRP tasks and further boosts the performance of the multi-task model. Experimental results on 6 seen and 10 unseen VRP variants with up to 1000 nodes indicate that our proposed method consistently achieves superior performance on both uniform and real-world benchmarks, demonstrating robust generalization abilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

However, commonly used learning methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations. Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance in both cases.</p></details> |  |

Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Extension of "Progressive Growing of Patch Size: Resource-Efficient Curriculum Learning for Dense Prediction Tasks" (MICCAI2024) submitted to MedIA</p></details> |

We propose RDTE-UNet, a segmentation network that unifies local modeling with global context to strengthen boundary delineation and detail preservation. RDTE-UNet employs a hybrid ResBlock detail-aware Transformer backbone and three modules: ASBE for adaptive boundary enhancement, HVDA for fine-grained feature modeling, and EulerFF for fusion weighting guided by Euler's formula.

It has extensive applications across diverse domains such as computer networking, transportation systems, and image segmentation. The objective is to maximize the total throughput while respecting edge capacity constraints and maintaining flow conservation at all intermediate vertices. Among the various algorithms proposed for solving the Max-Flow problem, the Push--Relabel algorithm is particularly notable for its efficiency and suitability for parallelization, owing to its localized vertex-based operations. This property has motivated extensive research into GPU-accelerated Max-Flow computation, leveraging the high degree of parallelism inherent to modern GPU architectures. In this paper, we present a novel GPU-parallel Max-Flow algorithm capable of incrementally recomputing the maximum flow of a dynamic graph following a batch of edge updates. In addition, we introduce a high-performance static GPU algorithm designed for efficiently computing the initial Max-Flow on static graphs. We further describe a series of CUDA-specific implementation optimizations that enhance performance, scalability, and memory efficiency on GPU platforms.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning-based polyp segmentation models either compromise clinical decision-making by providing ambiguous polyp margins in segmentation outputs or rely on heavy architectures with high computational complexity, resulting in insufficient inference speeds for real-time colorectal endoscopic applications. To address this problem, we propose MicroAUNet, a light-weighted attention-based segmentation network that combines depthwise-separable dilated convolutions with a single-path, parameter-shared channel-spatial attention block to strengthen multi-scale boundary features. On the basis of it, a progressive two-stage knowledge-distillation scheme is introduced to transfer semantic and boundary cues from a high-capacity teacher. Extensive experiments on benchmarks also demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy under extremely low model complexity, indicating that MicroAUNet is suitable for real-time clinical polyp segmentation.

However, FL systems remain vulnerable to membership-inference attacks and data heterogeneity. This paper presents FedOnco-Bench, a reproducible benchmark for privacy-aware FL using synthetic oncologic CT scans with tumor annotations. It evaluates segmentation performance and privacy leakage across FL methods: FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN, and FedAvg with DP-SGD. Results show a distinct trade-off between privacy and utility: FedAvg is high performance (Dice around 0.85) with more privacy leakage (attack AUC about 0.72), while DP-SGD provides a higher level of privacy (AUC around 0.25) at the cost of accuracy (Dice about 0.79). FedProx and FedBN offer balanced performance under heterogeneous data, especially with non-identical distributed client data. FedOnco-Bench serves as a standardized, open-source platform for benchmarking and developing privacy-preserving FL methods for medical image segmentation.</p></details> | Published in IEEE |

Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient methods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated, domain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask learning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class activation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything (SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient feedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation and classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and improve the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world clinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines by double digits in limited label settings.

We created the first CGM model called Background Erase Network (BEN). BEN consists of two components: BEN Base for initial segmentation and BEN Refiner for confidence-based refinement. Our approach achieves substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods on the DIS5K validation dataset, demonstrating that matting-based refinement can significantly enhance segmentation quality.

However, existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically, inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings.</p></details> |  |

This need is particularly pronounced in mobile medical devices, which require lightweight, deployable models with real-time performance. However, existing lightweight models often suffer from poor robustness across datasets, limiting their widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LV-UNet, a lightweight and vanilla model that leverages pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large backbones and incorporates fusible modules. LV-UNet employs an enhanced deep training strategy and switches to a deployment mode during inference by re-parametrization, significantly reducing parameter count and computational overhead. Experimental results on ISIC 2016, BUSI, CVC-ClinicDB, CVC-ColonDB, and Kvair-SEG datasets demonstrate a better trade-off between performance and the computational load.

Investigating Age and Ethnic Bias in the MAMA-MIA Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27421v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Imaging Meets EurIPS (NeurIPS-endorsed workshop) - MedEurIPS</p></details> |
| **[BALR-SAM: Boundary-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of SAM for Resource-Efficient Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24204v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.</p></details> |  |

| **[SPG-CDENet: Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network for Multi-Organ Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26390v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis. While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, the segmentation of CT images is impeded by low contrast and complex vertebral boundaries. Although advanced models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promise in various segmentation tasks, their performance in spinal CT imaging is limited by high annotation requirements and poor domain adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose SpinalSAM-R1, a multimodal vision-language interactive system that integrates a fine-tuned SAM with DeepSeek-R1, for spine CT image segmentation. Specifically, our SpinalSAM-R1 introduces an anatomy-guided attention mechanism to improve spine segmentation performance, and a semantics-driven interaction protocol powered by DeepSeek-R1, enabling natural language-guided refinement. The SpinalSAM-R1 is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient adaptation. We validate our SpinalSAM-R1 on the spine anatomical structure with CT images. Experimental results suggest that our method achieves superior segmentation performance. Meanwhile, we develop a PyQt5-based interactive software, which supports point, box, and text-based prompts. The system supports 11 clinical operations with 94.3\% parsing accuracy and sub-800 ms response times. The software is released on https://github.com/6jm233333/spinalsam-r1.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 Tab...</summary><p>2 Tables,5 Figures,16 Equations</p></details> |

Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound (US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL) framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ScribbleVS: Scribble-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Dynamic Competitive Pseudo Label Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10237v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical medicine, precise image segmentation can provide substantial support to clinicians. However, obtaining high-quality segmentation typically demands extensive pixel-level annotations, which are labor-intensive and expensive. Scribble annotations offer a more cost-effective alternative by improving labeling efficiency. Nonetheless, using such sparse supervision for training reliable medical image segmentation models remains a significant challenge. Some studies employ pseudo-labeling to enhance supervision, but these methods are susceptible to noise interference. To address these challenges, we introduce ScribbleVS, a framework designed to learn from scribble annotations. We introduce a Regional Pseudo Labels Diffusion Module to expand the scope of supervision and reduce the impact of noise present in pseudo labels. Additionally, we introduce a Dynamic Competitive Selection module for enhanced refinement in selecting pseudo labels. Experiments conducted on the ACDC, MSCMRseg, WORD, and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate promising results, achieving segmentation precision comparable to fully supervised models.

We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First, unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods, delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation for Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08549v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, existing models are often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs, Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of fully annotated datasets and strict privacy regulations present significant barriers to data sharing. Federated Learning (FL) allows decentralized model training, but existing FL methods often struggle with partial labeling, leading to model divergence and catastrophic forgetting. We propose ConDistFL, a novel FL framework incorporating conditional distillation to address these challenges. ConDistFL enables effective learning from partially labeled datasets, significantly improving segmentation accuracy across distributed and non-uniform datasets. In addition to its superior segmentation performance, ConDistFL maintains computational and communication efficiency, ensuring its scalability for real-world applications. Furthermore, ConDistFL demonstrates remarkable generalizability, significantly outperforming existing FL methods in out-of-federation tests, even adapting to unseen contrast phases (e.g., non-contrast CT images) in our experiments. Extensive evaluations on 3D CT and 2D chest X-ray datasets show that ConDistFL is an efficient, adaptable solution for collaborative medical image segmentation in privacy-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted to IEEE JBHI and is currently under peer review</p></details> |

Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty, which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated. Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC. Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical diagnostic scenarios.

Its successor, SAM2, has attracted significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing topological segmentation loss functions are primarily based on the persistent homology of the image. They match the persistent features from the segmentation with the persistent features from the ground truth and minimize the difference between them. However, these methods suffer from an ambiguous matching problem since the matching only relies on the information in the topological space. In this work, we propose an effective and efficient Spatial-Aware Topological Loss Function that further leverages the information in the original spatial domain of the image to assist the matching of persistent features. Extensive experiments on images of various types of tubular structures show that the proposed method has superior performance in improving the topological accuracy of the segmentation compared with state-of-the-art methods.

However, CNNs face limitations in capturing long-range dependencies, while transformers suffer from high computational complexity. To address this, we propose RWKV-UNet, a novel model that integrates the RWKV (Receptance Weighted Key Value) structure into the U-Net architecture. This integration enhances the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and to improve contextual understanding, which is crucial for accurate medical image segmentation. We build a strong encoder with developed Global-Local Spatial Perception (GLSP) blocks combining CNNs and RWKVs. We also propose a Cross-Channel Mix (CCM) module to improve skip connections with multi-scale feature fusion, achieving global channel information integration. Experiments on 11 benchmark datasets show that the RWKV-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on various types of medical image segmentation tasks. Additionally, smaller variants, RWKV-UNet-S and RWKV-UNet-T, balance accuracy and computational efficiency, making them suitable for broader clinical applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoMix: Learnable Weighted Multi-Scale Logits Mixing for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22995v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>U-shaped networks output logits at multiple spatial scales, each capturing a different blend of coarse context and fine detail. Yet, training still treats these logits in isolation - either supervising only the final, highest-resolution logits or applying deep supervision with identical loss weights at every scale - without exploring mixed-scale combinations. Consequently, the decoder output misses the complementary cues that arise only when coarse and fine predictions are fused. To address this issue, we introduce LoMix (Logits Mixing), a NAS-inspired, differentiable plug-and-play module that generates new mixed-scale outputs and learns how exactly each of them should guide the training process. More precisely, LoMix mixes the multi-scale decoder logits with four lightweight fusion operators: addition, multiplication, concatenation, and attention-based weighted fusion, yielding a rich set of synthetic mutant maps. Every original or mutant map is given a softplus loss weight that is co-optimized with network parameters, mimicking a one-step architecture search that automatically discovers the most useful scales, mixtures, and operators. Plugging LoMix into recent U-shaped architectures (i.e., PVT-V2-B2 backbone with EMCAD decoder) on Synapse 8-organ dataset improves DICE by +4.2% over single-output supervision, +2.2% over deep supervision, and +1.5% over equally weighted additive fusion, all with zero inference overhead. When training data are scarce (e.g., one or two labeled scans), the advantage grows to +9.23%, underscoring LoMix's data efficiency. Across four benchmarks and diverse U-shaped networks, LoMiX improves DICE by up to +13.5% over single-output supervision, confirming that learnable weighted mixed-scale fusion generalizes broadly while remaining data efficient, fully interpretable, and overhead-free at inference.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code and pretrained models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/RoMA.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

However, applying these models to the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks, including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire understanding in the AI community.

However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching.

While recent transformer-based detectors like RT-DETR have shown promise in object detection tasks, their application to medical imaging, particularly pneumonia detection in chest X-rays, remains underexplored. This paper presents CGF-DETR, an enhanced real-time detection transformer specifically designed for pneumonia detection. We introduce XFABlock in the backbone to improve multi-scale feature extraction through convolutional attention mechanisms integrated with CSP architecture. To achieve efficient feature aggregation, we propose SPGA module that replaces standard multi-head attention with dynamic gating mechanisms and single-head self-attention. Additionally, GCFC3 is designed for the neck to enhance feature representation through multi-path convolution fusion while maintaining real-time performance via structural re-parameterization. Extensive experiments on the RSNA Pneumonia Detection dataset demonstrate that CGF-DETR achieves 82.2% mAP@0.5, outperforming the baseline RT-DETR-l by 3.7% while maintaining comparable inference speed at 48.1 FPS. Our ablation studies confirm that each proposed module contributes meaningfully to the overall performance improvement, with the complete model achieving 50.4% mAP@[0.5:0.95]</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Fourier-embedded Network for RGB and Thermal Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18409v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of deep learning has significantly improved salient object detection (SOD) combining both RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images. However, existing Transformer-based RGB-T SOD models with quadratic complexity are memory-intensive, limiting their application in high-resolution bimodal feature fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose a purely Fourier Transform-based model, namely Deep Fourier-embedded Network (FreqSal), for accurate RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we leverage the efficiency of Fast Fourier Transform with linear complexity to design three key components: (1) To fuse RGB and thermal modalities, we propose Modal-coordinated Perception Attention, which aligns and enhances bimodal Fourier representation in multiple dimensions; (2) To clarify object edges and suppress noise, we design Frequency-decomposed Edge-aware Block, which deeply decomposes and filters Fourier components of low-level features; (3) To accurately decode features, we propose Fourier Residual Channel Attention Block, which prioritizes high-frequency information while aligning channel-wise global relationships. Additionally, even when converged, existing deep learning-based SOD models' predictions still exhibit frequency gaps relative to ground-truth. To address this problem, we propose Co-focus Frequency Loss, which dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing bimodal edge information in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on ten bimodal SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that FreqSal outperforms twenty-nine existing state-of-the-art bimodal SOD models. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the value and effectiveness of our newly proposed components.

Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for 3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex, leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

| **[Parameterized Prompt for Incremental Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27316v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[WXSOD: A Benchmark for Robust Salient Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12250v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of 14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network (WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture. Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at https://github.com/C-water/WXSOD</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we present a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles large-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even temporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs linear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single versatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized variants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal temporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or multi-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive and even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks, including 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D occupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion prediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm naturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous driving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope UniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models in autonomous driving. Code is available at https://github.com/happinesslz/UniLION</p></details> |  |

Existing event detectors, however, are limited by fixed-frequency paradigms and fail to fully exploit the high-temporal resolution and adaptability of event data. To address these limitations, we propose FlexEvent, a novel framework that enables detection at varying frequencies. Our approach consists of two key components: FlexFuse, an adaptive event-frame fusion module that integrates high-frequency event data with rich semantic information from RGB frames, and FlexTune, a frequency-adaptive fine-tuning mechanism that generates frequency-adjusted labels to enhance model generalization across varying operational frequencies. This combination allows our method to detect objects with high accuracy in both fast-moving and static scenarios, while adapting to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on large-scale event camera datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in both standard and high-frequency settings. Notably, our method maintains robust performance when scaling from 20 Hz to 90 Hz and delivers accurate detection up to 180 Hz, proving its effectiveness in extreme conditions. Our framework sets a new benchmark for event-based object detection and paves the way for more adaptable, real-time vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 28 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables; Code at https://flexevent.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Contrast-Guided Cross-Modal Distillation for Thermal Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01435v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust perception at night remains challenging for thermal-infrared detection: low contrast and weak high-frequency cues lead to duplicate, overlapping boxes, missed small objects, and class confusion. Prior remedies either translate TIR to RGB and hope pixel fidelity transfers to detection -- making performance fragile to color or structure artifacts -- or fuse RGB and TIR at test time, which requires extra sensors, precise calibration, and higher runtime cost. Both lines can help in favorable conditions, but do not directly shape the thermal representation used by the detector. We keep mono-modality inference and tackle the root causes during training. Specifically, we introduce training-only objectives that sharpen instance-level decision boundaries by pulling together features of the same class and pushing apart those of different classes -- suppressing duplicate and confusing detections -- and that inject cross-modal semantic priors by aligning the student's multi-level pyramid features with an RGB-trained teacher, thereby strengthening texture-poor thermal features without visible input at test time. In experiments, our method outperformed prior approaches and achieved state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Agnostic Instance-level Descriptor for Visual Instance Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16745v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of effective instance-level feature representation. Supervised or weakly supervised object detection methods are not the appropriate solutions due to their poor performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance-level region discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of instance regions. On the one hand, this kind of hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and occlusions, which are widely observed in real scenarios. On the other hand, the non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the instance regions in different granularities within an image. Therefore, features in uniform length are produced for these instance regions, which may cover across a dominant image region, an integral of multiple instances, or various individual instances. Such a collection of features allows us to unify the image retrieval, multi-instance search, and instance search into one framework. The empirical studies on three benchmarks show that such an instance-level descriptor remains effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Moreover, the superior performance is achieved on single-instance and multi-instance search, as well as image retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTAA: A Detect, Track and Avoid Architecture for navigation in spaces with Multiple Velocity Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08121v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proactive collision avoidance measures are imperative in environments where humans and robots coexist. Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Eyes on Target, a novel depth-aware and gaze-guided object detection framework designed for egocentric videos. Our approach injects gaze-derived features into the attention mechanism of a Vision Transformer (ViT), effectively biasing spatial feature selection toward human-attended regions. Unlike traditional object detectors that treat all regions equally, our method emphasises viewer-prioritised areas to enhance object detection. We validate our method on an egocentric simulator dataset where human visual attention is critical for task assessment, illustrating its potential in evaluating human performance in simulation scenarios. We evaluate the effectiveness of our gaze-integrated model through extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating consistent gains in detection accuracy over gaze-agnostic baselines on both the custom simulator dataset and public benchmarks, including Ego4D Ego-Motion and Ego-CH-Gaze datasets. To interpret model behaviour, we also introduce a gaze-aware attention head importance metric, revealing how gaze cues modulate transformer attention dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reflectance Prediction-based Knowledge Distillation for Robust 3D Object Detection in Compressed Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17442v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regarding intelligent transportation systems, low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for facilitating real-time collaborative perception among connected agents, such as vehicles and infrastructures, under restricted bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A teacher detector with the same structure as the student detector is designed for performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our cross-source distillation training strategy (CDTS) equips the student detector with robustness to low-quality compressed data while preserving the accuracy benefits of raw data through transferred distillation knowledge. Experimental results on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X-V datasets demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. We will release the code publicly at https://github.com/HaoJing-SX/RPKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid YOLOv5-SSD IoT-Based Animal Detection System for Durian Plantation Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00777v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Durian plantation suffers from animal intrusions that cause crop damage and financial loss. The traditional farming practices prove ineffective due to the unavailability of monitoring without human intervention. The fast growth of machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to new ways to detect animals. However, current systems are limited by dependence on single object detection algorithms, less accessible notification platforms, and limited deterrent mechanisms. This research suggests an IoT-enabled animal detection system for durian crops. The system integrates YOLOv5 and SSD object detection algorithms to improve detection accuracy. The system provides real-time monitoring, with detected intrusions automatically reported to farmers via Telegram notifications for rapid response. An automated sound mechanism (e.g., tiger roar) is triggered once the animal is detected. The YOLO+SSD model achieved accuracy rates of elephant, boar, and monkey at 90%, 85% and 70%, respectively. The system shows the highest accuracy in daytime and decreases at night, regardless of whether the image is still or a video. Overall, this study contributes a comprehensive and practical framework that combines detection, notification, and deterrence, paving the way for future innovations in automated farming solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Space Object Detection using Multi-frame Temporal Trajectory Completion Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19220v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%). We will release our code soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to the IEEE Transactions</p></details> |

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted. 5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, their deployment in safety-critical applications is hindered by the inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal Prediction, a post-hoc predictive uncertainty quantification procedure with statistical guarantees that are valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or data distribution. Our contribution is manifold. First, we formally define the problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD). We introduce a novel method, Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical guarantees of Conformal Risk Control to two sequential tasks with two parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we present old and new loss functions and prediction sets suited to applying SeqCRC to different cases and certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit for replication and further exploration of our method. Using this toolkit, we perform extensive experiments that validate our approach and emphasize trade-offs and other practical consequences.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Gaussian Combined Distance: A Generic Metric for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27649v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD). Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization, which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets.

However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of adversarial robustness in deep learning.</p></details> |  |

Fusing the these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity, hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction. Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work conducted in 2024; released for archival purposes</p></details> |

We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3). Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead (21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency, providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

As a byproduct of this goal, we also evaluate how frequently the banners comply with GDPR and the recommendations of national data protection authorities regarding banner designs. We visited 2,579 websites and identified the type of cookie banner implemented. Although 45% of the relevant websites have fully compliant banners, we found aesthetic manipulation on 38% of the compliant banners. Unlike prior studies of aesthetic manipulation, we use a computer vision model for salient object detection to measure how salient (i.e., attention-drawing) each banner element is. This enables the discovery of new types of aesthetic manipulation (e.g., button placement), and leads us to conclude that aesthetic manipulation is more common than previously reported (38% vs 27% of banners). To study the effects of user and/or website location on cookie banner design, we include websites within the European Union (EU), where privacy regulation enforcement is more stringent, and websites outside the EU. We visited websites from IP addresses in the EU and from IP addresses in the United States (US). We find that 13.9% of EU websites change their banner design when the user is from the US, and EU websites are roughly 48.3% more likely to use aesthetic manipulation than non-EU websites, highlighting their innovative responses to privacy regulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to International AAAI Conference on Web and Social Media 2026 (ICWSM'26)</p></details> |
| **[Improving Classification of Occluded Objects through Scene Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26681v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of occlusions has provided substantial challenges to typically-powerful object recognition algorithms. Additional sources of information can be extremely valuable to reduce errors caused by occlusions. Scene context is known to aid in object recognition in biological vision. In this work, we attempt to add robustness into existing Region Proposal Network-Deep Convolutional Neural Network (RPN-DCNN) object detection networks through two distinct scene-based information fusion techniques. We present one algorithm under each methodology: the first operates prior to prediction, selecting a custom object network to use based on the identified background scene, and the second operates after detection, fusing scene knowledge into initial object scores output by the RPN. We demonstrate our algorithms on challenging datasets featuring partial occlusions, which show overall improvement in both recall and precision against baseline methods. In addition, our experiments contrast multiple training methodologies for occlusion handling, finding that training on a combination of both occluded and unoccluded images demonstrates an improvement over the others. Our method is interpretable and can easily be adapted to other datasets, offering many future directions for research and practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[All You Need for Object Detection: From Pixels, Points, and Prompts to Next-Gen Fusion and Multimodal LLMs/VLMs in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26641v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are transforming the future of transportation through advances in intelligent perception, decision-making, and control systems. However, their success is tied to one core capability, reliable object detection in complex and multimodal environments. While recent breakthroughs in Computer Vision (CV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have driven remarkable progress, the field still faces a critical challenge as knowledge remains fragmented across multimodal perception, contextual reasoning, and cooperative intelligence. This survey bridges that gap by delivering a forward-looking analysis of object detection in AVs, emphasizing emerging paradigms such as Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and Generative AI rather than re-examining outdated techniques. We begin by systematically reviewing the fundamental spectrum of AV sensors (camera, ultrasonic, LiDAR, and Radar) and their fusion strategies, highlighting not only their capabilities and limitations in dynamic driving environments but also their potential to integrate with recent advances in LLM/VLM-driven perception frameworks. Next, we introduce a structured categorization of AV datasets that moves beyond simple collections, positioning ego-vehicle, infrastructure-based, and cooperative datasets (e.g., V2V, V2I, V2X, I2I), followed by a cross-analysis of data structures and characteristics. Ultimately, we analyze cutting-edge detection methodologies, ranging from 2D and 3D pipelines to hybrid sensor fusion, with particular attention to emerging transformer-driven approaches powered by Vision Transformers (ViTs), Large and Small Language Models (SLMs), and VLMs. By synthesizing these perspectives, our survey delivers a clear roadmap of current capabilities, open challenges, and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles large-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even temporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs linear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single versatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized variants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal temporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or multi-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive and even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks, including 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D occupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion prediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm naturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous driving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope UniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models in autonomous driving. Code is available at https://github.com/happinesslz/UniLION</p></details> |  |
| **[UniSOT: A Unified Framework for Multi-Modality Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01427v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single object tracking aims to localize target object with specific reference modalities (bounding box, natural language or both) in a sequence of specific video modalities (RGB, RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal or RGB+Event.). Different reference modalities enable various human-machine interactions, and different video modalities are demanded in complex scenarios to enhance tracking robustness. Existing trackers are designed for single or several video modalities with single or several reference modalities, which leads to separate model designs and limits practical applications. Practically, a unified tracker is needed to handle various requirements. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no tracker that can perform tracking with these above reference modalities across these video modalities simultaneously. Thus, in this paper, we present a unified tracker, UniSOT, for different combinations of three reference modalities and four video modalities with uniform parameters. Extensive experimental results on 18 visual tracking, vision-language tracking and RGB+X tracking benchmarks demonstrate that UniSOT shows superior performance against modality-specific counterparts. Notably, UniSOT outperforms previous counterparts by over 3.0\% AUC on TNL2K across all three reference modalities and outperforms Un-Track by over 2.0\% main metric across all three RGB+X video modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by TPAMI</p></details> |

Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniTrack++: Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking by Learning Large-FoV Trajectory Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00510v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in panoramic imagery, which introduces unique challenges including a 360{\deg} Field of View (FoV), resolution dilution, and severe view-dependent distortions. Conventional MOT methods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily under these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space, and identity ambiguity under a 360{\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a feedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory cues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly alleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations, FlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization and reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an ExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts design, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift. Finally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end and tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a balanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous evaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for panoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and BipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot. Together, these datasets span wide-angle environments and diverse motion patterns, providing a challenging testbed for real-world panoramic perception. Extensive experiments on JRDB and EmboTrack demonstrate that OmniTrack++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding substantial HOTA improvements of +25.5% on JRDB and +43.07% on QuadTrack over the original OmniTrack.

| **[Lattice Boltzmann Model for Learning Real-World Pixel Dynamicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16527v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to learn real-world pixel dynamicity for visual tracking. LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%). We will release our code soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to the IEEE Transactions</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behaviour classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviours such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioural analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Approach for Visual Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24410v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers.

Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with integrated implementations of baselines for fair comparison.

| **[Bootstrapping Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05039v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring understanding is a fundamental task that bridges natural language and visual content by localizing objects described in free-form expressions. However, existing works are constrained by limited language expressiveness, lacking the capacity to model object dynamics in spatial numbers and temporal states. To address these limitations, we introduce a new and general referring understanding task, termed referring multi-object tracking (RMOT). Its core idea is to employ a language expression as a semantic cue to guide the prediction of multi-object tracking, comprehensively accounting for variations in object quantity and temporal semantics. Along with RMOT, we introduce a RMOT benchmark named Refer-KITTI-V2, featuring scalable and diverse language expressions. To efficiently generate high-quality annotations covering object dynamics with minimal manual effort, we propose a semi-automatic labeling pipeline that formulates a total of 9,758 language prompts. In addition, we propose TempRMOT, an elegant end-to-end Transformer-based framework for RMOT. At its core is a query-driven Temporal Enhancement Module that represents each object as a Transformer query, enabling long-term spatial-temporal interactions with other objects and past frames to efficiently refine these queries. TempRMOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Refer-KITTI and Refer-KITTI-V2, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[PlanarTrack: A high-quality and challenging benchmark for large-scale planar object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23368v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short- and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations, each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/PlanarTrack</p></details> |  |

Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method, ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in such comparisons.

This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models, and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAD: Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation to Bridge Spatio-Temporal Gaps in Event-Based Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19560v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference. However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose {Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of each designed component. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on LiDAR-Based Tracking Across Road Users: Robustness Evaluation and Target-Aware Black-Box Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20893v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we delve into the robustness of neural network-based LiDAR point cloud tracking models under adversarial attacks, a critical aspect often overlooked in favor of performance enhancement. These models, despite incorporating advanced architectures like Transformer or Bird's Eye View (BEV), tend to neglect robustness in the face of challenges such as adversarial attacks, domain shifts, or data corruption. We instead focus on the robustness of the tracking models under the threat of adversarial attacks. We begin by establishing a unified framework for conducting adversarial attacks within the context of 3D object tracking, which allows us to thoroughly investigate both white-box and black-box attack strategies. For white-box attacks, we tailor specific loss functions to accommodate various tracking paradigms and extend existing methods such as FGSM, C\&W, and PGD to the point cloud domain. In addressing black-box attack scenarios, we introduce a novel transfer-based approach, the Target-aware Perturbation Generation (TAPG) algorithm, with the dual objectives of achieving high attack performance and maintaining low perceptibility. This method employs a heuristic strategy to enforce sparse attack constraints and utilizes random sub-vector factorization to bolster transferability. Our experimental findings reveal a significant vulnerability in advanced tracking methods when subjected to both black-box and white-box attacks, underscoring the necessity for incorporating robustness against adversarial attacks into the design of LiDAR point cloud tracking models. Notably, compared to existing methods, the TAPG also strikes an optimal balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the concealment of the perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall. To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and stable management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02512v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

| **[DMTrack: Deformable State-Space Modeling for UAV Multi-Object Tracking with Kalman Fusion and Uncertainty-Aware Association](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17860v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) presents unique challenges due to unpredictable object motion, frequent occlusions, and limited appearance cues inherent to aerial viewpoints. These issues are further exacerbated by abrupt UAV movements, leading to unreliable trajectory estimation and identity switches. Conventional motion models, such as Kalman filters or static sequence encoders, often fall short in capturing both linear and non-linear dynamics under such conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose DMTrack, a deformable motion tracking framework tailored for UAV-based MOT. Our DMTrack introduces three key components: DeformMamba, a deformable state-space predictor that dynamically aggregates historical motion states for adaptive trajectory modeling; MotionGate, a lightweight gating module that fuses Kalman and Mamba predictions based on motion context and uncertainty; and an uncertainty-aware association strategy that enhances identity preservation by aligning motion trends with prediction confidence. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity consistency and tracking accuracy, particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Importantly, our method operates without appearance models and maintains competitive efficiency, highlighting its practicality for robust UAV-based tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPIPTrack: Rethinking Prompt Modeling with Explicit and Implicit Prompts for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13235v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment. Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust adaptability and superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT.</p></details> |  |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |
| **[LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.</p></details> |  |

Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR https://openreview.net/forum?id=loT6xhgLYK</p></details> |

Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

However, applying these models to the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks, including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire understanding in the AI community.

However, training deep learning models requires large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of 10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model training.</p></details> |  |

Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

Despite some DWT-based methods improving SR by capturing fine-grained frequency signals, most existing approaches neglect the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, resulting in inconsistencies and unnatural artifacts in the reconstructed images. To address this challenge, we propose a Diffusion Transformer model based on image Wavelet spectra for SR (DTWSR). DTWSR incorporates the superiority of diffusion models and transformers to capture the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, leading to a more consistence and realistic SR image. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose images into wavelet spectra. A pyramid tokenization method is proposed which embeds the spectra into a sequence of tokens for transformer model, facilitating to capture features from both spatial and frequency domain. A dual-decoder is designed elaborately to handle the distinct variances in low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands, without omitting their alignment in image generation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with high performance on both perception quality and fidelity.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Oral Paper |
| **[Structured Cognitive Loop for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, but their use as autonomous agents introduces architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revisions included clarifying that this work is a preliminary study in the Abstract, improving the readability of figures, and adding emphasis on the role of the meta-prompt in the system's architecture and hallucination control</p></details> |

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10.

Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.</p></details> |  |

Recent work integrates future images into the understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand, generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance. We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world evaluations.

While recent voxel-based approaches can generate both geometric structures and semantic labels, existing range-view methods are limited to producing unlabeled LiDAR scenes. Relying on pretrained segmentation models to predict the semantic maps often results in suboptimal cross-modal consistency. To address this limitation while preserving the advantages of range-view representations, such as computational efficiency and simplified network design, we propose Spiral, a novel range-view LiDAR diffusion model that simultaneously generates depth, reflectance images, and semantic maps. Furthermore, we introduce novel semantic-aware metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated labeled range-view data. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Spiral achieves state-of-the-art performance with the smallest parameter size, outperforming two-step methods that combine the generative and segmentation models. Additionally, we validate that range images generated by Spiral can be effectively used for synthetic data augmentation in the downstream segmentation training, significantly reducing the labeling effort on LiDAR data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 24 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables; Code at https://dekai21.github.io/SPIRAL/</p></details> |

Motivated by the astonishing advance in image generation models that makes synthetic data an intrinsic part of model training in various computer vision tasks, we exploit synthetic image generation in our approach. Usually, the generated synthetic data is dependent on the task, and most of the time it is used to enlarge the available real training dataset. With NSYNC, alternatively, we focus on generating negative synthetic sets to be used in a novel contrastive training scheme along with real positive images. In our proposed training setup, we forward negative data along with positive data and obtain negative and positive gradients, respectively. We then refine the positive gradient by subtracting its projection onto the negative gradient to get the orthogonal component, based on which the parameters are updated. This orthogonal component eliminates the trivial attributes that are present in both positive and negative data and directs the model towards capturing a more unique style. Experiments on various styles of painters and illustrators show that our approach improves the performance over the baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[Differentiable Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Plans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22049v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space, finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii) it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings. We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>LC an...</summary><p>LC and RT have equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[FIRE: Robust Detection of Diffusion-Generated Images via Frequency-Guided Reconstruction Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07140v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models has significantly improved high-quality image generation, making generated content increasingly challenging to distinguish from real images and raising concerns about potential misuse. In this paper, we observe that diffusion models struggle to accurately reconstruct mid-band frequency information in real images, suggesting the limitation could serve as a cue for detecting diffusion model generated images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method called Frequency-guided Reconstruction Error (FIRE), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the influence of frequency decomposition on reconstruction error. FIRE assesses the variation in reconstruction error before and after the frequency decomposition, offering a robust method for identifying diffusion model generated images. Extensive experiments show that FIRE generalizes effectively to unseen diffusion models and maintains robustness against diverse perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures.

| **[TextAtlas5M: A Large-scale Dataset for Dense Text Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07870v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 15 figures.

| **[SmartFreeEdit: Mask-Free Spatial-Aware Image Editing with Complex Instruction Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12704v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image. Our project will be available at https://github.com/smileformylove/SmartFreeEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Attention Fails: A Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Personalization: Towards Fine-Grained Explainability in Natural Language for Personalized Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01932v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Differential Vision Transformer: Learning Visual Contrasts via Pairwise Differentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00833v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a universal backbone for both image recognition and image generation. Yet their Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) layer still performs a quadratic query-key interaction for every token pair, spending the bulk of computation on visually weak or redundant correlations. We introduce Visual-Contrast Attention (VCA), a drop-in replacement for MHSA that injects an explicit notion of discrimination while reducing the theoretical complexity from O(N N C) to O(N n C) with n << N. VCA first distils each head's dense query field into a handful of spatially pooled visual-contrast tokens, then splits them into a learnable positive and negative stream whose differential interaction highlights what truly separates one region from another. The module adds fewer than 0.3M parameters to a DeiT-Tiny backbone, requires no extra FLOPs, and is wholly architecture-agnostic. Empirically, VCA lifts DeiT-Tiny top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K from 72.2% to 75.6% (+3.4) and improves three strong hierarchical ViTs by up to 3.1%, while in class-conditional ImageNet generation it lowers FID-50K by 2.1 to 5.2 points across both diffusion (DiT) and flow (SiT) models. Extensive ablations confirm that (i) spatial pooling supplies low-variance global cues, (ii) dual positional embeddings are indispensable for contrastive reasoning, and (iii) combining the two in both stages yields the strongest synergy. VCA therefore offers a simple path towards faster and sharper Vision Transformers. The source code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LinearDiff.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[EraseFlow: Learning Concept Erasure Policies via GFlowNet-Driven Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00804v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Erasing harmful or proprietary concepts from powerful text to image generators is an emerging safety requirement, yet current "concept erasure" techniques either collapse image quality, rely on brittle adversarial losses, or demand prohibitive retraining cycles. We trace these limitations to a myopic view of the denoising trajectories that govern diffusion based generation. We introduce EraseFlow, the first framework that casts concept unlearning as exploration in the space of denoising paths and optimizes it with GFlowNets equipped with the trajectory balance objective. By sampling entire trajectories rather than single end states, EraseFlow learns a stochastic policy that steers generation away from target concepts while preserving the model's prior. EraseFlow eliminates the need for carefully crafted reward models and by doing this, it generalizes effectively to unseen concepts and avoids hackable rewards while improving the performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that EraseFlow outperforms existing baselines and achieves an optimal trade off between performance and prior preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Spotlight | Project page: https://eraseflow.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[EDITOR: Effective and Interpretable Prompt Inversion for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03067v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Erasing 'Ugly' from the Internet: Propagation of the Beauty Myth in Text-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00749v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media has exacerbated the promotion of Western beauty norms, leading to negative self-image, particularly in women and girls, and causing harm such as body dysmorphia. Increasingly content on the internet has been artificially generated, leading to concerns that these norms are being exaggerated. The aim of this work is to study how generative AI models may encode 'beauty' and erase 'ugliness', and discuss the implications of this for society. To investigate these aims, we create two image generation pipelines: a text-to-image model and a text-to-language model-to image model. We develop a structured beauty taxonomy which we use to prompt three language models (LMs) and two text-to-image models to cumulatively generate 5984 images using our two pipelines. We then recruit women and non-binary social media users to evaluate 1200 of the images through a Likert-scale within-subjects study. Participants show high agreement in their ratings. Our results show that 86.5% of generated images depicted people with lighter skin tones, 22% contained explicit content despite Safe for Work (SFW) training, and 74% were rated as being in a younger age demographic. In particular, the images of non-binary individuals were rated as both younger and more hypersexualised, indicating troubling intersectional effects. Notably, prompts encoded with 'negative' or 'ugly' beauty traits (such as "a wide nose") consistently produced higher Not SFW (NSFW) ratings regardless of gender. This work sheds light on the pervasive demographic biases related to beauty standards present in generative AI models -- biases that are actively perpetuated by model developers, such as via negative prompting. We conclude by discussing the implications of this on society, which include pollution of the data streams and active erasure of features that do not fall inside the stereotype of what is considered beautiful by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint under review</p></details> |
| **[ERA-Solver: Error-Robust Adams Solver for Fast Sampling of Diffusion Probabilistic Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.12935v4)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Though denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have achieved remarkable generation results, the low sampling efficiency of DDPMs still limits further applications. Since DDPMs can be formulated as diffusion ordinary differential equations (ODEs), various fast sampling methods can be derived from solving diffusion ODEs. However, we notice that previous fast sampling methods with fixed analytical form are not able to robust with the various error patterns in the noise estimated from pretrained diffusion models. In this work, we construct an error-robust Adams solver (ERA-Solver), which utilizes the implicit Adams numerical method that consists of a predictor and a corrector. Different from the traditional predictor based on explicit Adams methods, we leverage a Lagrange interpolation function as the predictor, which is further enhanced with an error-robust strategy to adaptively select the Lagrange bases with lower errors in the estimated noise. The proposed solver can be directly applied to any pretrained diffusion models, without extra training. Experiments on Cifar10, CelebA, LSUN-Church, and ImageNet 64 x 64 (conditional) datasets demonstrate that our proposed ERA-Solver achieves 3.54, 5.06, 5.02, and 5.11 Frechet Inception Distance (FID) for image generation, with only 10 network evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolve to Inspire: Novelty Search for Diverse Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00686v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models, while proficient at generating high-fidelity images, often suffer from limited output diversity, hindering their application in exploratory and ideation tasks. Existing prompt optimization techniques typically target aesthetic fitness or are ill-suited to the creative visual domain. To address this shortcoming, we introduce WANDER, a novelty search-based approach to generating diverse sets of images from a single input prompt. WANDER operates directly on natural language prompts, employing a Large Language Model (LLM) for semantic evolution of diverse sets of images, and using CLIP embeddings to quantify novelty. We additionally apply emitters to guide the search into distinct regions of the prompt space, and demonstrate that they boost the diversity of the generated images. Empirical evaluations using FLUX-DEV for generation and GPT-4o-mini for mutation demonstrate that WANDER significantly outperforms existing evolutionary prompt optimization baselines in diversity metrics. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of emitters.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, Accepted to Neurips 2025 GenProCC Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Policy Optimized Text-to-Image Pipeline Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21478v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has evolved beyond single monolithic models to complex multi-component pipelines. These combine fine-tuned generators, adapters, upscaling blocks and even editing steps, leading to significant improvements in image quality. However, their effective design requires substantial expertise. Recent approaches have shown promise in automating this process through large language models (LLMs), but they suffer from two critical limitations: extensive computational requirements from generating images with hundreds of predefined pipelines, and poor generalization beyond memorized training examples. We introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based framework that addresses these inefficiencies. Our approach first trains an ensemble of reward models capable of predicting image quality scores directly from prompt-workflow combinations, eliminating the need for costly image generation during training. We then implement a two-phase training strategy: initial workflow vocabulary training followed by GRPO-based optimization that guides the model toward higher-performing regions of the workflow space. Additionally, we incorporate a classifier-free guidance based enhancement technique that extrapolates along the path between the initial and GRPO-tuned models, further improving output quality. We validate our approach through a set of comparisons, showing that it can successfully create new flows with greater diversity and lead to superior image quality compared to existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Autoregressive Image Generation with Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12245v5)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AiM, an autoregressive (AR) image generative model based on Mamba architecture. AiM employs Mamba, a novel state-space model characterized by its exceptional performance for long-sequence modeling with linear time complexity, to supplant the commonly utilized Transformers in AR image generation models, aiming to achieve both superior generation quality and enhanced inference speed. Unlike existing methods that adapt Mamba to handle two-dimensional signals via multi-directional scan, AiM directly utilizes the next-token prediction paradigm for autoregressive image generation. This approach circumvents the need for extensive modifications to enable Mamba to learn 2D spatial representations. By implementing straightforward yet strategically targeted modifications for visual generative tasks, we preserve Mamba's core structure, fully exploiting its efficient long-sequence modeling capabilities and scalability. We provide AiM models in various scales, with parameter counts ranging from 148M to 1.3B. On the ImageNet1K 256*256 benchmark, our best AiM model achieves a FID of 2.21, surpassing all existing AR models of comparable parameter counts and demonstrating significant competitiveness against diffusion models, with 2 to 10 times faster inference speed.
