| **[CE-GPPO: Coordinating Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712v3)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Holistic Evaluation of Robustness in CLIP Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01534v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown significant potential, particularly in zero-shot classification across diverse distribution shifts. Building on existing evaluations of overall classification robustness, this work aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of CLIP by introducing several new perspectives. First, we investigate their robustness to variations in specific visual factors. Second, we assess two critical safety objectives--confidence uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection--beyond mere classification accuracy. Third, we evaluate the finesse with which CLIP models bridge the image and text modalities. Fourth, we extend our examination to 3D awareness in CLIP models, moving beyond traditional 2D image understanding. Finally, we explore the interaction between vision and language encoders within modern large multimodal models (LMMs) that utilize CLIP as the visual backbone, focusing on how this interaction impacts classification robustness. In each aspect, we consider the impact of six factors on CLIP models: model architecture, training distribution, training set size, fine-tuning, contrastive loss, and test-time prompts. Our study uncovers several previously unknown insights into CLIP. For instance, the architecture of the visual encoder in CLIP plays a significant role in their robustness against 3D corruption. CLIP models tend to exhibit a bias towards shape when making predictions. Moreover, this bias tends to diminish after fine-tuning on ImageNet. Vision-language models like LLaVA, leveraging the CLIP vision encoder, could exhibit benefits in classification performance for challenging categories over CLIP alone. Our findings are poised to offer valuable guidance for enhancing the robustness and reliability of CLIP models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE TPAMI, extension of NeurIPS'23 work: A Closer Look at the Robustness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)</p></details> |
| **[From Long Videos to Engaging Clips: A Human-Inspired Video Editing Framework with Multimodal Narrative Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02790v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks: highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500 professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[microCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Adaptation via Coarse-Fine Token Fusion for Fine-Grained Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation. Our code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Frames to Clips: Efficient Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

| **[AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Shaping Beyond Clipping: A Functional Perspective on Update Magnitude Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01578v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics, dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics. Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ACM Multimedia Asia 2025</p></details> |
| **[SoftAdaClip: A Smooth Clipping Strategy for Fair and Private Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01447v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations. Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and private model training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment. This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated, making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge, a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment. Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision, combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection. Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods, particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available at https://github.com/christti98/semobridge.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Clip-Low Increases Entropy and Clip-High Decreases Entropy in Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26114v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy, while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Knowledge Graphs to harvest datasets for efficient CLIP model training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02746v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training high-quality CLIP models typically requires enormous datasets, which limits the development of domain-specific models -- especially in areas that even the largest CLIP models do not cover well -- and drives up training costs. This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at GCPR 2025 (German Conference on Pattern Recognition).

| **[Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | Still unpolished |
| **[Differentially Private Clipped-SGD: High-Probability Convergence with Arbitrary Clipping Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23512v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy guarantees.</p></details> | 60 pages |
| **[Convergence of Clipped-SGD for Convex $(L_0,L_1)$-Smooth Optimization with Heavy-Tailed Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20817v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping is a widely used technique in Machine Learning and Deep Learning (DL), known for its effectiveness in mitigating the impact of heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in the training of large language models. Additionally, first-order methods with clipping, such as Clip-SGD, exhibit stronger convergence guarantees than SGD under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption, a property observed in many DL tasks. However, the high-probability convergence of Clip-SGD under both assumptions -- heavy-tailed noise and $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness -- has not been fully addressed in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by establishing the first high-probability convergence bounds for Clip-SGD applied to convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our analysis extends prior results by recovering known bounds for the deterministic case and the stochastic setting with $L_1 = 0$ as special cases. Notably, our rates avoid exponentially large factors and do not rely on restrictive sub-Gaussian noise assumptions, significantly broadening the applicability of gradient clipping.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Bridging the Task Gap: Multi-Task Adversarial Transferability in CLIP and Its Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23917v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoPatch: Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation by Leveraging Untapped Spatial Knowledge in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23098v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v4)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoCLIP-Lite: Efficient Video Recognition by Fusing CLIP with Motion Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17084v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCLIP-Lite.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees. We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).</p></details> |  |
| **[WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21153v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mammo-CLIP Dissect: A Framework for Analysing Mammography Concepts in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21102v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists' workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories (e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g., density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and generalisation.

| **[CLIPin: A Non-contrastive Plug-in to CLIP for Multimodal Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06434v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks.

| **[Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting ResNet-based CLIP via Neuron-Attention Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19943v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic, represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second, we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability.

| **[Efficiently Disentangling CLIP for Multi-Object Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP excel at recognizing the single, prominent object in a scene. However, they struggle in complex scenes containing multiple objects. We identify a fundamental reason for this limitation: VLM feature space exhibits excessive mutual feature information (MFI), where the features of one class contain substantial information about other, unrelated classes. This high MFI becomes evident during class-specific queries, as unrelated objects are activated alongside the queried class. To address this limitation, we propose DCLIP, an efficient framework that learns an optimal level of mutual information while adding only minimal learnable parameters to a frozen VLM. DCLIP uses two complementary losses: a novel MFI Loss that regulates class feature similarity to prevent excessive overlap while preserving necessary shared information, and the Asymmetric Loss (ASL) that aligns image features with the disentangled text features. Through this disentanglement, DCLIP reduces excessive inter-class similarity by 30%. On multi-label recognition, DCLIP performs favorably over SOTA approaches on VOC2007 and COCO-14 while using 75% fewer training parameters. For zero-shot semantic segmentation, it shows improved performance across six benchmark datasets. These results highlight the importance of feature disentanglement for multi-object perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP Can Understand Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03251v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Pattern Recognition, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training CLIP against Data Poisoning with Optimal Transport-based Matching and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18717v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.</p></details> |  |

Part I lays the theoretical and numerical foundations on positive-definite kernels; discrete and continuous RKHS; kernel engineering and scaling maps; error assessment via kernel discrepancy/maximum mean discrepancy (MMD); and a systematic operator view of kernels. In this viewpoint, projection, gradient, divergence, and Laplace-Beltrami operators are built directly from kernels, enabling discrete analogues of differential operators and variational tools that connect learning with PDE-style modeling. Part II turns to practice across four domains. In machine learning, we treat supervised and unsupervised tasks, then develop RKHS-based generative modeling, contrasting density and projection approaches and enhancing them with OT and scalable, combinatorial assignments. We introduce clustering strategies that reduce computational burden and support large-scale regression and transport. In physics-informed modeling, we present mesh-free kernel discretizations for elliptic and time-dependent PDEs, discuss automatic differentiation, and propose high-order discrete approximations. In reinforcement learning, we formulate kernel Q-learning and non-parametric HJB methods, and show how kernel operators yield sample-efficient baselines on continuous-state, discrete-action tasks. In mathematical finance, we build nonparametric time-series models and market generators, study benchmarking and extrapolation for pricing, and apply the framework to stress testing and portfolio methods.</p></details> | 180 pages |
| **[Automaton Constrained Q-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05061v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world robotic tasks often require agents to achieve sequences of goals while respecting time-varying safety constraints. However, standard Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigms are fundamentally limited in these settings. A natural approach to these problems is to combine RL with Linear-time Temporal Logic (LTL), a formal language for specifying complex, temporally extended tasks and safety constraints. Yet, existing RL methods for LTL objectives exhibit poor empirical performance in complex and continuous environments. As a result, no scalable methods support both temporally ordered goals and safety simultaneously, making them ill-suited for realistic robotics scenarios. We propose Automaton Constrained Q-Learning (ACQL), an algorithm that addresses this gap by combining goal-conditioned value learning with automaton-guided reinforcement. ACQL supports most LTL task specifications and leverages their automaton representation to explicitly encode stage-wise goal progression and both stationary and non-stationary safety constraints. We show that ACQL outperforms existing methods across a range of continuous control tasks, including cases where prior methods fail to satisfy either goal-reaching or safety constraints. We further validate its real-world applicability by deploying ACQL on a 6-DOF robotic arm performing a goal-reaching task in a cluttered, cabinet-like space with safety constraints. Our results demonstrate that ACQL is a robust and scalable solution for learning robotic behaviors according to rich temporal specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel approach to interpreting LLMs by applying inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to recover their implicit reward functions. We conduct experiments on toxicity-aligned LLMs of varying sizes, extracting reward models that achieve up to 85% accuracy in predicting human preferences. Our analysis reveals key insights into the non-identifiability of reward functions, the relationship between model size and interpretability, and potential pitfalls in the RLHF process. We demonstrate that IRL-derived reward models can be used to fine-tune new LLMs, resulting in comparable or improved performance on toxicity benchmarks. This work provides a new lens for understanding and improving LLM alignment, with implications for the responsible development and deployment of these powerful systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at COLM 2025</p></details> |

The recent emergence of Video-Large Multimodal Models (Video-LMMs), which integrate visual encoders with powerful decoder-based language models, has demonstrated remarkable capabilities in video understanding tasks. However, the critical phase that transforms these models from basic perception systems into sophisticated reasoning engines, post-training, remains fragmented across the literature. This survey provides the first comprehensive examination of post-training methodologies for Video-LMMs, encompassing three fundamental pillars: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with chain-of-thought, reinforcement learning (RL) from verifiable objectives, and test-time scaling (TTS) through enhanced inference computation. We present a structured taxonomy that clarifies the roles, interconnections, and video-specific adaptations of these techniques, addressing unique challenges such as temporal localization, spatiotemporal grounding, long video efficiency, and multimodal evidence integration. Through systematic analysis of representative methods, we synthesize key design principles, insights, and evaluation protocols while identifying critical open challenges in reward design, scalability, and cost-performance optimization. We further curate essential benchmarks, datasets, and metrics to facilitate rigorous assessment of post-training effectiveness. This survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners with a unified framework for advancing Video-LMM capabilities.

In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler, prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 14 pages of supplementary material</p></details> |

TARS3D translates the block-shaped 'TARS' robot from Interstellar into a 0.25 m, 0.99 kg research platform with seven actuated degrees of freedom. The film shows two primary gaits: a bipedal-like walk and a high-speed rolling mode. For TARS3D, we build reduced-order models for each, derive closed-form limit-cycle conditions, and validate the predictions on hardware. Experiments confirm that the robot respects its +/-150 degree hip limits, alternates left-right contacts without interference, and maintains an eight-step hybrid limit cycle in rolling mode. Because each telescopic leg provides four contact corners, the rolling gait is modeled as an eight-spoke double rimless wheel. The robot's telescopic leg redundancy implies a far richer gait repertoire than the two limit cycles treated analytically. So, we used deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in simulation to search the unexplored space. We observed that the learned policy can recover the analytic gaits under the right priors and discover novel behaviors as well. Our findings show that TARS3D's fiction-inspired bio-transcending morphology can realize multiple previously unexplored locomotion modes and that further learning-driven search is likely to reveal more. This combination of analytic synthesis and reinforcement learning opens a promising pathway for multimodal robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 10 figures.

| **[Reinforce-Ada: An Adaptive Sampling Framework for Reinforce-Style LLM Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04996v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) for reasoning tasks is often bottlenecked by unstable gradient estimates due to fixed and uniform sampling of responses across prompts. Prior work such as GVM-RAFT addresses this by dynamically allocating inference budget per prompt to minimize stochastic gradient variance under a budget constraint. Inspired by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Ada, an adaptive sampling framework for online RL post-training of LLMs that continuously reallocates sampling effort to the prompts with the greatest uncertainty or learning potential. Unlike conventional two-stage allocation methods, Reinforce-Ada interleaves estimation and sampling in an online successive elimination process, and automatically stops sampling for a prompt once sufficient signal is collected. To stabilize updates, we form fixed-size groups with enforced reward diversity and compute advantage baselines using global statistics aggregated over the adaptive sampling phase. Empirical results across multiple model architectures and reasoning benchmarks show that Reinforce-Ada accelerates convergence and improves final performance compared to GRPO, especially when using the balanced sampling variant. Our work highlights the central role of variance-aware, adaptive data curation in enabling efficient and reliable reinforcement learning for reasoning-capable LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/RLHFlow/Reinforce-Ada.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Physics-informed Value Learner for Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06782v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on these challenges, we propose a \emph{Physics-informed (Pi)} regularized loss for value learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Eikonal-regularized HIQL (Eik-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale navigation tasks.</p></details> |  |

In the context of the ForestEyes project, which combines citizen science and machine learning to detect deforestation in tropical forests, image segments are used for labeling by volunteers and subsequent model training. Traditionally, the Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) algorithm is adopted as the segmentation method. However, recent studies have indicated that other superpixel-based methods outperform SLIC in remote sensing image segmentation, and might suggest that they are more suitable for the task of detecting deforested areas. In this sense, this study investigated the impact of the four best segmentation methods, together with SLIC, on the training of classifiers for the target application. Initially, the results showed little variation in performance among segmentation methods, even when selecting the top five classifiers using the PyCaret AutoML library. However, by applying a classifier fusion approach (ensemble of classifiers), noticeable improvements in balanced accuracy were observed, highlighting the importance of both the choice of segmentation method and the combination of machine learning-based models for deforestation detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, paper accepted to present at CIARP 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Gaze to Insight: Bridging Human Visual Attention and Vision Language Model Explanation for Weakly-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11368v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to the high cost of pixel-level annotations for training. In the context of weak supervision, clinician gaze data captures regions of diagnostic interest; however, its sparsity limits its use for segmentation. In contrast, vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic context through textual descriptions but lack the explanation precision required. Recognizing that neither source alone suffices, we propose a teacher-student framework that integrates both gaze and language supervision, leveraging their complementary strengths. Our key insight is that gaze data indicates where clinicians focus during diagnosis, while VLMs explain why those regions are significant. To implement this, the teacher model first learns from gaze points enhanced by VLM-generated descriptions of lesion morphology, establishing a foundation for guiding the student model. The teacher then directs the student through three strategies: (1) Multi-scale feature alignment to fuse visual cues with textual semantics; (2) Confidence-weighted consistency constraints to focus on reliable predictions; (3) Adaptive masking to limit error propagation in uncertain areas. Experiments on the Kvasir-SEG, NCI-ISBI, and ISIC datasets show that our method achieves Dice scores of 80.78%, 80.53%, and 84.22%, respectively-improving 3-5% over gaze baselines without increasing the annotation burden. By preserving correlations among predictions, gaze data, and lesion descriptions, our framework also maintains clinical interpretability. This work illustrates how integrating human visual attention with AI-generated semantic context can effectively overcome the limitations of individual weak supervision signals, thereby advancing the development of deployable, annotation-efficient medical AI systems.

| **[From Segments to Concepts: Interpretable Image Classification via Concept-Guided Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04180v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in computer vision; however, their black-box nature in decision-making limits interpretability and trust, particularly in safety-critical applications. Interpretability is crucial in domains where errors have severe consequences. Existing models not only lack transparency but also risk exploiting unreliable or misleading features, which undermines both robustness and the validity of their explanations. Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) aim to improve transparency by reasoning through human-interpretable concepts. Still, they require costly concept annotations and lack spatial grounding, often failing to identify which regions support each concept. We propose SEG-MIL-CBM, a novel framework that integrates concept-guided image segmentation into an attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) framework, where each segmented region is treated as an instance and the model learns to aggregate evidence across them. By reasoning over semantically meaningful regions aligned with high-level concepts, our model highlights task-relevant evidence, down-weights irrelevant cues, and produces spatially grounded, concept-level explanations without requiring annotations of concepts or groups. SEG-MIL-CBM achieves robust performance across settings involving spurious correlations (unintended dependencies between background and label), input corruptions (perturbations that degrade visual quality), and large-scale benchmarks, while providing transparent, concept-level explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoMiSeg: Automatic Medical Image Segmentation via Test-Time Adaptation of Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17931v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is vital for clinical diagnosis, yet current deep learning methods often demand extensive expert effort, i.e., either through annotating large training datasets or providing prompts at inference time for each new case. This paper introduces a zero-shot and automatic segmentation pipeline that combines off-the-shelf vision-language and segmentation foundation models. Given a medical image and a task definition (e.g., "segment the optic disc in an eye fundus image"), our method uses a grounding model to generate an initial bounding box, followed by a visual prompt boosting module that enhance the prompts, which are then processed by a promptable segmentation model to produce the final mask. To address the challenges of domain gap and result verification, we introduce a test-time adaptation framework featuring a set of learnable adaptors that align the medical inputs with foundation model representations. Its hyperparameters are optimized via Bayesian Optimization, guided by a proxy validation model without requiring ground-truth labels. Our pipeline offers an annotation-efficient and scalable solution for zero-shot medical image segmentation across diverse tasks. Our pipeline is evaluated on seven diverse medical imaging datasets and shows promising results. By proper decomposition and test-time adaptation, our fully automatic pipeline not only substantially surpasses the previously best-performing method, yielding a 69\% relative improvement in accuracy (Dice Score from 42.53 to 71.81), but also performs competitively with weakly-prompted interactive foundation models.</p></details> |  |

However, they are not naturally amenable to predictive tasks such as segmentation, where they must learn semantic structures over a distribution of signals. In this study, we introduce MetaSeg, a meta-learning framework to train INRs for medical image segmentation. MetaSeg uses an underlying INR that simultaneously predicts per pixel intensity values and class labels. It then uses a meta-learning procedure to find optimal initial parameters for this INR over a training dataset of images and segmentation maps, such that the INR can simply be fine-tuned to fit pixels of an unseen test image, and automatically decode its class labels. We evaluated MetaSeg on 2D and 3D brain MRI segmentation tasks and report Dice scores comparable to commonly used U-Net models, but with $90\%$ fewer parameters. MetaSeg offers a fresh, scalable alternative to traditional resource-heavy architectures such as U-Nets and vision transformers for medical image segmentation.

However, existing models are often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs, Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce DuPLUS, a deep learning framework for efficient multi-modal medical image analysis. DuPLUS introduces a novel vision-language framework that leverages hierarchical semantic prompts for fine-grained control over the analysis task, a capability absent in prior universal models. To enable extensibility to other medical tasks, it includes a hierarchical, text-controlled architecture driven by a unique dual-prompt mechanism. For segmentation, DuPLUS is able to generalize across three imaging modalities, ten different anatomically various medical datasets, encompassing more than 30 organs and tumor types. It outperforms the state-of-the-art task specific and universal models on 8 out of 10 datasets. We demonstrate extensibility of its text-controlled architecture by seamless integration of electronic health record (EHR) data for prognosis prediction, and on a head and neck cancer dataset, DuPLUS achieved a Concordance Index (CI) of 0.69. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning enables rapid adaptation to new tasks and modalities from varying centers, establishing DuPLUS as a versatile and clinically relevant solution for medical image analysis.

In this work, we propose Wave-GMS, a lightweight and efficient multi-scale generative model for medical image segmentation. Wave-GMS has a substantially smaller number of trainable parameters, does not require loading memory-intensive pretrained vision foundation models, and supports training with large batch sizes on GPUs with limited memory. We conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets (BUS, BUSI, Kvasir-Instrument, and HAM10000), demonstrating that Wave-GMS achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance with superior cross-domain generalizability, while requiring only ~2.6M trainable parameters.

Current foundation models either lack volumetric awareness or suffer from limited interactive capabilities. We propose a training strategy that combines dynamic volumetric prompt generation with content-aware adaptive cropping to optimize the use of the image encoder. Our method simulates realistic user interaction patterns during training while addressing the computational challenges of learning from sequential refinement feedback on a single GPU. For efficient training, we initialize our network using the publicly available weights from the nnInteractive segmentation model. Evaluation on the \textbf{Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation} competition demonstrates strong performance with an average final Dice score of 0.6385, normalized surface distance of 0.6614, and area-under-the-curve metrics of 2.4799 (Dice) and 2.5671 (NSD).</p></details> |  |
| **[VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02086v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate detection and segmentation of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are essential for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical monitoring. While convolutional architectures such as U-Net have long been the backbone of medical image segmentation, their limited capacity to capture long-range dependencies constrains performance on complex tumor structures. Recent advances in diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential for generating high-fidelity medical images and refining segmentation boundaries. In this work, we propose VGDM: Vision-Guided Diffusion Model for Brain Tumor Detection and Segmentation framework, a transformer-driven diffusion framework for brain tumor detection and segmentation. By embedding a vision transformer at the core of the diffusion process, the model leverages global contextual reasoning together with iterative denoising to enhance both volumetric accuracy and boundary precision. The transformer backbone enables more effective modeling of spatial relationships across entire MRI volumes, while diffusion refinement mitigates voxel-level errors and recovers fine-grained tumor details. This hybrid design provides a pathway toward improved robustness and scalability in neuro-oncology, moving beyond conventional U-Net baselines. Experimental validation on MRI brain tumor datasets demonstrates consistent gains in Dice similarity and Hausdorff distance, underscoring the potential of transformer-guided diffusion models to advance the state of the art in tumor segmentation.</p></details> |  |

While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner. Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in multiple scenarios accurately.

Existing online planar mapping approaches struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency: direct depth image segmentation from specific sensors suffers from poor temporal integration, height map-based methods cannot represent complex 3D structures like overhangs, and voxel-based plane segmentation remains unexplored for real-time applications. To address these limitations, we develop a novel framework that integrates vertex-based connected component labeling with random sample consensus based plane detection and convex hull, leveraging GPU parallel computing to rapidly extract planar regions from point clouds accumulated in high-resolution 3D voxel maps. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves fast and accurate 3D multi-plane segmentation at over 30 Hz update rate even at a resolution of 0.01 m, enabling the detected planes to be utilized in real time for locomotion tasks. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments in both simulated environments and physical legged robot platforms, confirming robust locomotion performance when considering 3D planar structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

However, the brittleness of DL models to noisy and out-of-distribution inputs is ailing their deployment in sensitive fields. Current models often lack uncertainty quantification, providing only point estimates. We propose SUPER-Net, a Bayesian framework for trustworthy image segmentation via uncertainty propagation. Using Taylor series approximations, SUPER-Net propagates the mean and covariance of the model's posterior distribution across nonlinear layers. It generates two outputs simultaneously: the segmented image and a pixel-wise uncertainty map, eliminating the need for expensive Monte Carlo sampling. SUPER-Net's performance is extensively evaluated on MRI and CT scans under various noisy and adversarial conditions. Results show that SUPER-Net outperforms state-of-the-art models in robustness and accuracy. The uncertainty map identifies low-confidence areas affected by noise or attacks, allowing the model to self-assess segmentation reliability, particularly when errors arise from noise or adversarial examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Pattern Recognition.

Recent advances in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception, encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance of this work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to X-Sense Ego-Exo Sensing for Smart Mobility Workshop at ICCV 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Methods based on prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask. We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model. https://github.com/uos-sis/quanproto</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond one-hot encoding? Journey into compact encoding for large multi-class segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00667v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting, hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) = 82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8. Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large multi-class segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at EMA4MICCAI 2025 Workshop</p></details> |

CNN-based models, despite their extensive use, suffer from a local receptive field and fail to capture the global context. A common approach that combines CNNs with transformers attempts to bridge this gap but fails to effectively fuse the local and global features. With the recent emergence of VLMs and foundation models, they have been adapted for downstream medical imaging tasks; however, they suffer from an inherent domain gap and high computational cost. To this end, we propose U-DFA, a unified DINOv2-Unet encoder-decoder architecture that integrates a novel Local-Global Fusion Adapter (LGFA) to enhance segmentation performance. LGFA modules inject spatial features from a CNN-based Spatial Pattern Adapter (SPA) module into frozen DINOv2 blocks at multiple stages, enabling effective fusion of high-level semantic and spatial features. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Synapse and ACDC datasets with only 33\% of the trainable model parameters. These results demonstrate that U-DFA is a robust and scalable framework for medical image segmentation across multiple modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Fast and Precise Method for Searching Rectangular Tumor Regions in Brain MR Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00505v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: To develop a fast and precise method for searching rectangular regions in brain tumor images. Methods: The authors propose a new method for searching rectangular tumor regions in brain MR images. The proposed method consisted of a segmentation network and a fast search method with a user-controllable search metric. As the segmentation network, the U-Net whose encoder was replaced by the EfficientNet was used. In the fast search method, summed-area tables were used for accelerating sums of voxels in rectangular regions. Use of the summed-area tables enabled exhaustive search of the 3D offset (3D full search). The search metric was designed for giving priority to cubes over oblongs, and assigning better values for higher tumor fractions even if they exceeded target tumor fractions. The proposed computation and metric were compared with those used in a conventional method using the Brain Tumor Image Segmentation dataset. Results: When the 3D full search was used, the proposed computation (8 seconds) was 100-500 times faster than the conventional computation (11-40 minutes). When the user-controllable parts of the search metrics were changed variously, the tumor fractions of the proposed metric were higher than those of the conventional metric. In addition, the conventional metric preferred oblongs whereas the proposed metric preferred cubes. Conclusion: The proposed method is promising for implementing fast and precise search of rectangular tumor regions, which is useful for brain tumor diagnosis using MRI systems. The proposed computation reduced processing times of the 3D full search, and the proposed metric improved the quality of the assigned rectangular tumor regions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain-Specialized Interactive Segmentation Framework for Meningioma Radiotherapy Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00416v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT) planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025 Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of 64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning.

This paper presents a comprehensive and systematic survey of MIS methodologies, bridging the gap between traditional image processing techniques and modern deep learning approaches. The survey encompasses thresholding, edge detection, region-based segmentation, clustering algorithms, and model-based techniques while also delving into state-of-the-art deep learning architectures such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs), and the widely adopted U-Net and its variants. Moreover, integrating attention mechanisms, semi-supervised learning, generative adversarial networks (GANs), and Transformer-based models is thoroughly explored. In addition to covering established methods, this survey highlights emerging trends, including hybrid architectures, cross-modality learning, federated and distributed learning frameworks, and active learning strategies, which aim to address challenges such as limited labeled datasets, computational complexity, and model generalizability across diverse imaging modalities. Furthermore, a specialized case study on lumbar spine segmentation is presented, offering insights into the challenges and advancements in this relatively underexplored anatomical region. Despite significant progress in the field, critical challenges persist, including dataset bias, domain adaptation, interpretability of deep learning models, and integration into real-world clinical workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Compu...</summary><p>Computers in Biology and Medicine (to appear)</p></details> |
| **[Automated and Scalable SEM Image Analysis of Perovskite Solar Cell Materials via a Deep Segmentation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26548v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) is indispensable for characterizing the microstructure of thin films during perovskite solar cell fabrication. Accurate identification and quantification of lead iodide and perovskite phases are critical because residual lead iodide strongly influences crystallization pathways and defect formation, while the morphology of perovskite grains governs carrier transport and device stability. Yet current SEM image analysis is still largely manual, limiting throughput and consistency. Here, we present an automated deep learning-based framework for SEM image segmentation that enables precise and efficient identification of lead iodide, perovskite and defect domains across diverse morphologies. Built upon an improved YOLOv8x architecture, our model named PerovSegNet incorporates two novel modules: (i) Adaptive Shuffle Dilated Convolution Block, which enhances multi-scale and fine-grained feature extraction through group convolutions and channel mixing; and (ii) Separable Adaptive Downsampling module, which jointly preserves fine-scale textures and large-scale structures for more robust boundary recognition. Trained on an augmented dataset of 10,994 SEM images, PerovSegNet achieves a mean Average Precision of 87.25% with 265.4 Giga Floating Point Operations, outperforming the baseline YOLOv8x-seg by 4.08%, while reducing model size and computational load by 24.43% and 25.22%, respectively. Beyond segmentation, the framework provides quantitative grain-level metrics, such as lead iodide/perovskite area and count, which can serve as reliable indicators of crystallization efficiency and microstructural quality. These capabilities establish PerovSegNet as a scalable tool for real-time process monitoring and data-driven optimization of perovskite thin-film fabrication.The source code is available at:https://github.com/wlyyj/PerovSegNet/tree/master.</p></details> |  |
| **[M$^{2}$SNet: Multi-scale in Multi-scale Subtraction Network for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10894v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate medical image segmentation is critical for early medical diagnosis. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use element-wise addition or concatenation to fuse different level features progressively in decoder. However, both the two operations easily generate plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the complementarity between different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and blurred edges of lesions. To address this challenge, we propose a general multi-scale in multi-scale subtraction network (M$^{2}$SNet) to finish diverse segmentation from medical image. Specifically, we first design a basic subtraction unit (SU) to produce the difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Next, we expand the single-scale SU to the intra-layer multi-scale SU, which can provide the decoder with both pixel-level and structure-level difference information. Then, we pyramidally equip the multi-scale SUs at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby achieving the inter-layer multi-scale feature aggregation and obtaining rich multi-scale difference information. In addition, we build a training-free network ``LossNet'' to comprehensively supervise the task-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives our multi-scale subtraction network to capture the detailed and structural cues simultaneously. Without bells and whistles, our method performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different evaluation metrics on eleven datasets of four different medical image segmentation tasks of diverse image modalities, including color colonoscopy imaging, ultrasound imaging, computed tomography (CT), and optical coherence tomography (OCT).

| **[U-MAN: U-Net with Multi-scale Adaptive KAN Network for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22444v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation faces significant challenges in preserving fine-grained details and precise boundaries due to complex anatomical structures and pathological regions. These challenges primarily stem from two key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features, and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN). Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI, GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRA-PT: Low-Rank Adapting UNETR for Hippocampus Segmentation Using Principal Tensor Singular Values and Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11292v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hippocampus is an important brain structure involved in various psychiatric disorders, and its automatic and accurate segmentation is vital for studying these diseases. Recently, deep learning-based methods have made significant progress in hippocampus segmentation. However, training deep neural network models requires substantial computational resources, time, and a large amount of labeled training data, which is frequently scarce in medical image segmentation. To address these issues, we propose LoRA-PT, a novel parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method that transfers the pre-trained UNETR model from the BraTS2021 dataset to the hippocampus segmentation task. Specifically, LoRA-PT divides the parameter matrix of the transformer structure into three distinct sizes, yielding three third-order tensors. These tensors are decomposed using tensor singular value decomposition to generate low-rank tensors consisting of the principal singular values and vectors, with the remaining singular values and vectors forming the residual tensor. During fine-tuning, only the low-rank tensors (i.e., the principal tensor singular values and vectors) are updated, while the residual tensors remain unchanged. We validated the proposed method on three public hippocampus datasets, and the experimental results show that LoRA-PT outperformed state-of-the-art PEFT methods in segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing the number of parameter updates. Our source code is available at https://github.com/WangangCheng/LoRA-PT/tree/LoRA-PT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (2025).

However, as deep neural networks scale up, full fine-tuning introduces substantial computational and storage challenges in resource-constrained environments, limiting its widespread adoption. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed to reduce computational complexity and storage requirements by minimizing the number of updated parameters. While matrix decomposition-based PEFT methods, such as LoRA, show promise, they struggle to fully capture the high-dimensional structural characteristics of model weights. In contrast, high-dimensional tensors offer a more natural representation of neural network weights, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of higher-order features and multi-dimensional interactions. In this paper, we propose tCURLoRA, a novel fine-tuning method based on tensor CUR decomposition. By concatenating pre-trained weight matrices into a three-dimensional tensor and applying tensor CUR decomposition, we update only the lower-order tensor components during fine-tuning, effectively reducing computational and storage overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that tCURLoRA outperforms existing PEFT methods in medical image segmentation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to MICCAI 2025.

| **[K-Prism: A Knowledge-Guided and Prompt Integrated Universal Medical Image Segmentation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25594v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is fundamental to clinical decision-making, yet existing models remain fragmented. They are usually trained on single knowledge sources and specific to individual tasks, modalities, or organs. This fragmentation contrasts sharply with clinical practice, where experts seamlessly integrate diverse knowledge: anatomical priors from training, exemplar-based reasoning from reference cases, and iterative refinement through real-time interaction. We present $\textbf{K-Prism}$, a unified segmentation framework that mirrors this clinical flexibility by systematically integrating three knowledge paradigms: (i) $\textit{semantic priors}$ learned from annotated datasets, (ii) $\textit{in-context knowledge}$ from few-shot reference examples, and (iii) $\textit{interactive feedback}$ from user inputs like clicks or scribbles. Our key insight is that these heterogeneous knowledge sources can be encoded into a dual-prompt representation: 1-D sparse prompts defining $\textit{what}$ to segment and 2-D dense prompts indicating $\textit{where}$ to attend, which are then dynamically routed through a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) decoder. This design enables flexible switching between paradigms and joint training across diverse tasks without architectural modifications. Comprehensive experiments on 18 public datasets spanning diverse modalities (CT, MRI, X-ray, pathology, ultrasound, etc.) demonstrate that K-Prism achieves state-of-the-art performance across semantic, in-context, and interactive segmentation settings. Code will be released upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLASP: Adaptive Spectral Clustering for Unsupervised Per-Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25016v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce CLASP (Clustering via Adaptive Spectral Processing), a lightweight framework for unsupervised image segmentation that operates without any labeled data or finetuning. CLASP first extracts per patch features using a self supervised ViT encoder (DINO); then, it builds an affinity matrix and applies spectral clustering. To avoid manual tuning, we select the segment count automatically with a eigengap silhouette search, and we sharpen the boundaries with a fully connected DenseCRF. Despite its simplicity and training free nature, CLASP attains competitive mIoU and pixel accuracy on COCO Stuff and ADE20K, matching recent unsupervised baselines. The zero training design makes CLASP a strong, easily reproducible baseline for large unannotated corpora especially common in digital advertising and marketing workflows such as brand safety screening, creative asset curation, and social media content moderation</p></details> |  |
| **[Bidirectional Uncertainty-Aware Region Learning for Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07457v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In semi-supervised medical image segmentation, the poor quality of unlabeled data and the uncertainty in the model's predictions lead to models that inevitably produce erroneous pseudo-labels. These errors accumulate throughout model training, thereby weakening the model's performance. We found that these erroneous pseudo-labels are typically concentrated in high-uncertainty regions. Traditional methods improve performance by directly discarding pseudo-labels in these regions, which can also result in neglecting potentially valuable training data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a bidirectional uncertainty-aware region learning strategy to fully utilize the precise supervision provided by labeled data and stabilize the training of unlabeled data. Specifically, in the training labeled data, we focus on high-uncertainty regions, using precise label information to guide the model's learning in potentially uncontrollable areas. Meanwhile, in the training of unlabeled data, we concentrate on low-uncertainty regions to reduce the interference of erroneous pseudo-labels on the model. Through this bidirectional learning strategy, the model's overall performance has significantly improved. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant performance improvement on different medical image segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Comparative Analysis of YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet for Motorbike Detection in Kigali Autonomous Driving Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04912v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Kigali, Rwanda, motorcycle taxis are a primary mode of transportation, often navigating unpredictably and disregarding traffic rules, posing significant challenges for autonomous driving systems. This study compares four object detection models--YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, SSD, and RetinaNet--for motorbike detection using a custom dataset of 198 images collected in Kigali. Implemented in PyTorch with transfer learning, the models were evaluated for accuracy, localization, and inference speed to assess their suitability for real-time navigation in resource-constrained settings. We identify implementation challenges, including dataset limitations and model complexities, and recommend simplified architectures for future work to enhance accessibility for autonomous systems in developing countries like Rwanda.</p></details> | 3 figures, 2 tables |

IR stream is less susceptible to noise than RGB in low-light conditions. However, it is dominated by active emitter patterns that hinder high-level tasks such as object detection, tracking and localisation. To address this, a U-Net-based architecture is proposed that reconstructs clean IR images from emitter-populated input, improving both image quality and downstream robotic performance. This approach outperforms existing enhancement techniques and enables reliable operation of vision-driven robotic systems across illumination conditions from well-lit to extreme low-light scenes.</p></details> | 8 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Leveraging Confident Image Regions for Source-Free Domain-Adaptive Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10081v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-free domain-adaptive object detection is an interesting but scarcely addressed topic. It aims at adapting a source-pretrained detector to a distinct target domain without resorting to source data during adaptation. So far, there is no data augmentation scheme tailored to source-free domain-adaptive object detection. To this end, this paper presents a novel data augmentation approach that cuts out target image regions where the detector is confident, augments them along with their respective pseudo-labels, and joins them into a challenging target image to adapt the detector. As the source data is out of reach during adaptation, we implement our approach within a teacher-student learning paradigm to ensure that the model does not collapse during the adaptation procedure. We evaluated our approach on three adaptation benchmarks of traffic scenes, scoring new state-of-the-art on two of them.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPEGNet: Synergistic Perception-Guided Network for Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04472v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection segments objects with intrinsic similarity and edge disruption. Current detection methods rely on accumulated complex components. Each approach adds components such as boundary modules, attention mechanisms, and multi-scale processors independently. This accumulation creates a computational burden without proportional gains. To manage this complexity, they process at reduced resolutions, eliminating fine details essential for camouflage. We present SPEGNet, addressing fragmentation through a unified design. The architecture integrates multi-scale features via channel calibration and spatial enhancement. Boundaries emerge directly from context-rich representations, maintaining semantic-spatial alignment. Progressive refinement implements scale-adaptive edge modulation with peak influence at intermediate resolutions. This design strikes a balance between boundary precision and regional consistency. SPEGNet achieves 0.887 $S_\alpha$ on CAMO, 0.890 on COD10K, and 0.895 on NC4K, with real-time inference speed. Our approach excels across scales, from tiny, intricate objects to large, pattern-similar ones, while handling occlusion and ambiguous boundaries.

| **[Periodontal Bone Loss Analysis via Keypoint Detection With Heuristic Post-Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13477v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes a deep learning framework and annotation methodology for the automatic detection of periodontal bone loss landmarks, associated conditions, and staging. 192 periapical radiographs were collected and annotated with a stage agnostic methodology, labelling clinically relevant landmarks regardless of disease presence or extent. We propose a heuristic post-processing module that aligns predicted keypoints to tooth boundaries using an auxiliary instance segmentation model. An evaluation metric, Percentage of Relative Correct Keypoints (PRCK), is proposed to capture keypoint performance in dental imaging domains. Four donor pose estimation models were adapted with fine-tuning for our keypoint problem. Post-processing improved fine-grained localisation, raising average PRCK^{0.05} by +0.028, but reduced coarse performance for PRCK^{0.25} by -0.0523 and PRCK^{0.5} by -0.0345. Orientation estimation shows excellent performance for auxiliary segmentation when filtered with either stage 1 object detection model. Periodontal staging was detected sufficiently, with the best mesial and distal Dice scores of 0.508 and 0.489, while furcation involvement and widened periodontal ligament space tasks remained challenging due to scarce positive samples. Scalability is implied with similar validation and external set performance. The annotation methodology enables stage agnostic training with balanced representation across disease severities for some detection tasks. The PRCK metric provides a domain-specific alternative to generic pose metrics, while the heuristic post-processing module consistently corrected implausible predictions with occasional catastrophic failures. The proposed framework demonstrates the feasibility of clinically interpretable periodontal bone loss assessment, with potential to reduce diagnostic variability and clinician workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 7 tables, 9 figures, 1 equation, journal paper submitted to Computers in Biology and Medicine</p></details> |
| **[From Filters to VLMs: Benchmarking Defogging Methods through Object Detection and Segmentation Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03906v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving perception systems are particularly vulnerable in foggy conditions, where light scattering reduces contrast and obscures fine details critical for safe operation. While numerous defogging methods exist-from handcrafted filters to learned restoration models-improvements in image fidelity do not consistently translate into better downstream detection and segmentation. Moreover, prior evaluations often rely on synthetic data, leaving questions about real-world transferability. We present a structured empirical study that benchmarks a comprehensive set of pipelines, including (i) classical filters, (ii) modern defogging networks, (iii) chained variants (filter$\rightarrow$model, model$\rightarrow$filter), and (iv) prompt-driven visual--language image editing models (VLM) applied directly to foggy images. Using Foggy Cityscapes, we assess both image quality and downstream performance on object detection (mAP) and segmentation (PQ, RQ, SQ). Our analysis reveals when defogging helps, when chaining yields synergy or degradation, and how VLM-based editors compare to dedicated approaches. In addition, we evaluate qualitative rubric-based scores from a VLM judge and quantify their alignment with task metrics, showing strong correlations with mAP. Together, these results establish a transparent, task-oriented benchmark for defogging methods and highlight the conditions under which preprocessing genuinely improves autonomous perception in adverse weather.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-View Open-Vocabulary Object Detection in Aerial Imagery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03858v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional object detection models are typically trained on a fixed set of classes, limiting their flexibility and making it costly to incorporate new categories. Open-vocabulary object detection addresses this limitation by enabling models to identify unseen classes without explicit training. Leveraging pretrained models contrastively trained on abundantly available ground-view image-text classification pairs provides a strong foundation for open-vocabulary object detection in aerial imagery. Domain shifts, viewpoint variations, and extreme scale differences make direct knowledge transfer across domains ineffective, requiring specialized adaptation strategies. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for adapting open-vocabulary representations from ground-view images to solve object detection in aerial imagery through structured domain alignment. The method introduces contrastive image-to-image alignment to enhance the similarity between aerial and ground-view embeddings and employs multi-instance vocabulary associations to align aerial images with text embeddings. Extensive experiments on the xView, DOTAv2, VisDrone, DIOR, and HRRSD datasets are used to validate our approach. Our open-vocabulary model achieves improvements of +6.32 mAP on DOTAv2, +4.16 mAP on VisDrone (Images), and +3.46 mAP on HRRSD in the zero-shot setting when compared to finetuned closed-vocabulary dataset-specific model performance, thus paving the way for more flexible and scalable object detection systems in aerial applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[LERa: Replanning with Visual Feedback in Instruction Following](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05135v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are increasingly used in robotics for task planning, but their reliance on textual inputs limits their adaptability to real-world changes and failures. To address these challenges, we propose LERa - Look, Explain, Replan - a Visual Language Model-based replanning approach that utilizes visual feedback. Unlike existing methods, LERa requires only a raw RGB image, a natural language instruction, an initial task plan, and failure detection - without additional information such as object detection or predefined conditions that may be unavailable in a given scenario. The replanning process consists of three steps: (i) Look - where LERa generates a scene description and identifies errors; (ii) Explain - where it provides corrective guidance; and (iii) Replan - where it modifies the plan accordingly. LERa is adaptable to various agent architectures and can handle errors from both dynamic scene changes and task execution failures. We evaluate LERa on the newly introduced ALFRED-ChaOS and VirtualHome-ChaOS datasets, achieving a 40% improvement over baselines in dynamic environments. In tabletop manipulation tasks with a predefined probability of task failure within the PyBullet simulator, LERa improves success rates by up to 67%. Further experiments, including real-world trials with a tabletop manipulator robot, confirm LERa's effectiveness in replanning. We demonstrate that LERa is a robust and adaptable solution for error-aware task execution in robotics.

| **[Enhancing Transformers Through Conditioned Embedded Tokens](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12789v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have transformed modern machine learning, driving breakthroughs in computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics. At the core of their success lies the attention mechanism, which enables the modeling of global dependencies among input tokens. However, we reveal that the attention block in transformers suffers from inherent ill-conditioning, which hampers gradient-based optimization and leads to inefficient training. To address this, we develop a theoretical framework that establishes a direct relationship between the conditioning of the attention block and that of the embedded tokenized data. Building on this insight, we introduce conditioned embedded tokens, a method that systematically modifies the embedded tokens to improve the conditioning of the attention mechanism. Our analysis demonstrates that this approach significantly mitigates ill-conditioning, leading to more stable and efficient training. We validate our methodology across various transformer architectures, achieving consistent improvements in image classification, object detection, instance segmentation, and natural language processing, highlighting its broad applicability and effectiveness.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Person-Centric Annotations of LAION-400M: Auditing Bias and Its Transfer to Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03721v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models trained on large-scale multimodal datasets show strong demographic biases, but the role of training data in producing these biases remains unclear. A major barrier has been the lack of demographic annotations in web-scale datasets such as LAION-400M. We address this gap by creating person-centric annotations for the full dataset, including over 276 million bounding boxes, perceived gender and race/ethnicity labels, and automatically generated captions. These annotations are produced through validated automatic labeling pipelines combining object detection, multimodal captioning, and finetuned classifiers. Using them, we uncover demographic imbalances and harmful associations, such as the disproportionate linking of men and individuals perceived as Black or Middle Eastern with crime-related and negative content. We also show that 60-70% of gender bias in CLIP and Stable Diffusion can be linearly explained by direct co-occurrences in the data. Our resources establish the first large-scale empirical link between dataset composition and downstream model bias.</p></details> | 48 pages |
| **[SAMSOD: Rethinking SAM Optimization for RGB-T Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03689v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-T salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment attractive objects by combining RGB and thermal infrared images. To enhance performance, the Segment Anything Model has been fine-tuned for this task. However, the imbalance convergence of two modalities and significant gradient difference between high- and low- activations are ignored, thereby leaving room for further performance enhancement. In this paper, we propose a model called \textit{SAMSOD}, which utilizes unimodal supervision to enhance the learning of non-dominant modality and employs gradient deconfliction to reduce the impact of conflicting gradients on model convergence. The method also leverages two decoupled adapters to separately mask high- and low-activation neurons, emphasizing foreground objects by enhancing background learning. Fundamental experiments on RGB-T SOD benchmark datasets and generalizability experiments on scribble supervised RGB-T SOD, fully supervised RGB-D SOD datasets and full-supervised RGB-D rail surface defect detection all demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</p></details> | Accepted by TMM |
| **[Automated Defect Detection for Mass-Produced Electronic Components Based on YOLO Object Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01914v2)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the defect detection of conventional industry components is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it leads to a significant burden on quality inspection personnel and makes it difficult to manage product quality. In this paper, we propose an automated defect detection system for the dual in-line package (DIP) that is widely used in industry, using digital camera optics and a deep learning (DL)-based model. The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described. The proposed automated defect detection can be easily established with numerous types of defects or insufficient defect data.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 16 figures, 7 tables, and published in IEEE Sensors Journal</p></details> |
| **[Neural Posterior Estimation with Autoregressive Tiling for Detecting Objects in Astronomical Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03074v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Upcoming astronomical surveys will produce petabytes of high-resolution images of the night sky, providing information about billions of stars and galaxies. Detecting and characterizing the astronomical objects in these images is a fundamental task in astronomy -- and a challenging one, as most of these objects are faint and many visually overlap with other objects. We propose an amortized variational inference procedure to solve this instance of small-object detection. Our key innovation is a family of spatially autoregressive variational distributions that partition and order the latent space according to a $K$-color checkerboard pattern. By construction, the conditional independencies of this variational family mirror those of the posterior distribution. We fit the variational distribution, which is parameterized by a convolutional neural network, using neural posterior estimation (NPE) to minimize an expectation of the forward KL divergence. Using images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. We further demonstrate that the proposed autoregressive structure greatly improves posterior calibration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Language Model as a Judge for Object Detection in Industrial Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03376v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial diagrams such as piping and instrumentation diagrams (P&IDs) are essential for the design, operation, and maintenance of industrial plants. Converting these diagrams into digital form is an important step toward building digital twins and enabling intelligent industrial automation. A central challenge in this digitalization process is accurate object detection. Although recent advances have significantly improved object detection algorithms, there remains a lack of methods to automatically evaluate the quality of their outputs. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a framework that employs Visual Language Models (VLMs) to assess object detection results and guide their refinement. The approach exploits the multimodal capabilities of VLMs to identify missing or inconsistent detections, thereby enabling automated quality assessment and improving overall detection performance on complex industrial diagrams.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-r...</summary><p>Pre-review version submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Align Your Query: Representation Alignment for Multimodality Medical Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02789v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple, detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection.

The presence of numerous players and frequent occlusions, combined with copyright restrictions, severely restricts the availability of datasets, leaving limited options such as SoccerNet-Tracking and SportsMOT. These datasets suffer from a lack of diversity, which hinders algorithms from adapting effectively to varied soccer video contexts. To address these challenges, we developed SoccerSynth-Detection, the first synthetic dataset designed for the detection of synthetic soccer players. It includes a broad range of random lighting and textures, as well as simulated camera motion blur. We validated its efficacy using the object detection model (Yolov8n) against real-world datasets (SoccerNet-Tracking and SportsMoT). In transfer tests, it matched the performance of real datasets and significantly outperformed them in images with motion blur; in pre-training tests, it demonstrated its efficacy as a pre-training dataset, significantly enhancing the algorithm's overall performance. Our work demonstrates the potential of synthetic datasets to replace real datasets for algorithm training in the field of soccer video analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>The S...</summary><p>The SoccerSynth-Detection Dataset is available at https://github.com/open-starlab/SoccerSynth-Detection</p></details> |

Preview-based suspension control mitigates their impact by detecting such irregularities in advance and adjusting suspension parameters proactively. Accurate and real-time detection is essential, but embedded deployment is constrained by limited computational resources and the small size of targets in input images.To address these challenges, this paper proposes SBP-YOLO, an efficient detection framework for speed bumps and potholes in embedded systems. Built upon YOLOv11n, it integrates GhostConv and VoVGSCSPC modules in the backbone and neck to reduce computation while enhancing multi-scale semantic features. A P2-level branch improves small-object detection, and a lightweight and efficient detection head (LEDH) maintains accuracy with minimal overhead. A hybrid training strategy further enhances robustness under varying road and environmental conditions, combining NWD loss, BCKD knowledge distillation, and Albumentations-based augmentation. Experiments show that SBP-YOLO achieves 87.0% mAP, outperforming the YOLOv11n baseline by 5.8%. After TensorRT FP16 quantization, it runs at 139.5 FPS on Jetson AGX Xavier, yielding a 12.4% speedup over the P2-enhanced YOLOv11. These results demonstrate the framework's suitability for fast, low-latency road condition perception in embedded suspension control systems.</p></details> | 14pages,11figures |
| **[Towards Size-invariant Salient Object Detection: A Generic Evaluation and Optimization Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15573v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols, particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed. The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at https://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Large Language Model Framework for Safe and Interpretable Grid-Integrated EVs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02592v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into smart grids presents unique opportunities to enhance both transportation systems and energy networks. However, ensuring safe and interpretable interactions between drivers, vehicles, and the surrounding environment remains a critical challenge. This paper presents a multi-modal large language model (LLM)-based framework to process multimodal sensor data - such as object detection, semantic segmentation, and vehicular telemetry - and generate natural-language alerts for drivers. The framework is validated using real-world data collected from instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles. This paper highlights the potential of LLMs as assistive tools in e-mobility, benefiting both transportation systems and electric networks by enabling scalable fleet coordination, EV load forecasting, and traffic-aware energy planning.

However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figure detection approach based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv12 object detection architecture. Our method achieved an F1-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set (hotspots only) and ranked second on the final test leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.7216 across complex and heterogeneous whole-slide regions, without relying on external data.</p></details> |  |

Everyday object interactions produce sounds unique to the objects involved. We introduce the sounding object detection task to evaluate a model's ability to link these sounds to the objects directly involved. Inspired by human perception, our multimodal object-aware framework learns from in-the-wild egocentric videos. To encourage an object-centric approach, we first develop an automatic pipeline to compute segmentation masks of the objects involved to guide the model's focus during training towards the most informative regions of the interaction. A slot attention visual encoder is used to further enforce an object prior.

| **[Automated Model Evaluation for Object Detection via Prediction Consistency and Reliability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12082v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in computer vision have made training object detectors more efficient and effective; however, assessing their performance in real-world applications still relies on costly manual annotation. To address this limitation, we develop an automated model evaluation (AutoEval) framework for object detection. We propose Prediction Consistency and Reliability (PCR), which leverages the multiple candidate bounding boxes that conventional detectors generate before non-maximum suppression (NMS). PCR estimates detection performance without ground-truth labels by jointly measuring 1) the spatial consistency between boxes before and after NMS, and 2) the reliability of the retained boxes via the confidence scores of overlapping boxes. For a more realistic and scalable evaluation, we construct a meta-dataset by applying image corruptions of varying severity. Experimental results demonstrate that PCR yields more accurate performance estimates than existing AutoEval methods, and the proposed meta-dataset covers a wider range of detection performance. The code is available at https://github.com/YonseiML/autoeval-det.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 Oral; v2: fixed a typo in the title and updated experimental results</p></details> |

Traditional field observations are often limited in scope, time-consuming, and labor-intensive, hindering the assessment of behavioral responses across landscapes. To address this, we present kabr-tools (Kenyan Animal Behavior Recognition Tools), an open-source package for automated multi-species behavioral monitoring. This framework integrates drone-based video with machine learning systems to extract behavioral, social, and spatial metrics from wildlife footage. Our pipeline leverages object detection, tracking, and behavioral classification systems to generate key metrics, including time budgets, behavioral transitions, social interactions, habitat associations, and group composition dynamics. Compared to ground-based methods, drone-based observations significantly improved behavioral granularity, reducing visibility loss by 15% and capturing more transitions with higher accuracy and continuity. We validate kabr-tools through three case studies, analyzing 969 behavioral sequences, surpassing the capacity of traditional methods for data capture and annotation. We found that, like Plains zebras, vigilance in Grevy's zebras decreases with herd size, but, unlike Plains zebras, habitat has a negligible impact. Plains and Grevy's zebras exhibit strong behavioral inertia, with rare transitions to alert behaviors and observed spatial segregation between Grevy's zebras, Plains zebras, and giraffes in mixed-species herds. By enabling automated behavioral monitoring at scale, kabr-tools offers a powerful tool for ecosystem-wide studies, advancing conservation, biodiversity research, and ecological monitoring.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Calibrating the Full Predictive Class Distribution of 3D Object Detectors for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01829v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous systems, precise object detection and uncertainty estimation are critical for self-aware and safe operation. This work addresses confidence calibration for the classification task of 3D object detectors. We argue that it is necessary to regard the calibration of the full predictive confidence distribution over all classes and deduce a metric which captures the calibration of dominant and secondary class predictions. We propose two auxiliary regularizing loss terms which introduce either calibration of the dominant prediction or the full prediction vector as a training goal. We evaluate a range of post-hoc and train-time methods for CenterPoint, PillarNet and DSVT-Pillar and find that combining our loss term, which regularizes for calibration of the full class prediction, and isotonic regression lead to the best calibration of CenterPoint and PillarNet with respect to both dominant and secondary class predictions. We further find that DSVT-Pillar can not be jointly calibrated for dominant and secondary predictions using the same method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounded GUI Understanding for Vision-Based Spatial Intelligent Agent: Exemplified by Extended Reality Apps](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10811v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, spatial computing a.k.a. Extended Reality (XR) has emerged as a transformative technology, offering users immersive and interactive experiences across diversified virtual environments. Users can interact with XR apps through interactable GUI elements (IGEs) on the stereoscopic three-dimensional (3D) graphical user interface (GUI). The accurate recognition of these IGEs is instrumental, serving as the foundation of many software engineering tasks, including automated testing and effective GUI search. The most recent IGE detection approaches for 2D mobile apps typically train a supervised object detection model based on a large-scale manually-labeled GUI dataset, usually with a pre-defined set of clickable GUI element categories like buttons and spinners. Such approaches can hardly be applied to IGE detection in XR apps, due to a multitude of challenges including complexities posed by open-vocabulary and heterogeneous IGE categories, intricacies of context-sensitive interactability, and the necessities of precise spatial perception and visual-semantic alignment for accurate IGE detection results. Thus, it is necessary to embark on the IGE research tailored to XR apps. In this paper, we propose the first zero-shot cOntext-sensitive inteRactable GUI ElemeNT dEtection framework for virtual Reality apps, named Orienter. By imitating human behaviors, Orienter observes and understands the semantic contexts of XR app scenes first, before performing the detection. The detection process is iterated within a feedback-directed validation and reflection loop. Specifically, Orienter contains three components, including (1) Semantic context comprehension, (2) Reflection-directed IGE candidate detection, and (3) Context-sensitive interactability classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Orienter is more effective than the state-of-the-art GUI element detection approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Adaptive Event Stream Slicing for Open-Vocabulary Event-Based Object Detection via Vision-Language Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00681v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common. Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model, guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network (SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information, our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then processed by CNNs for object detection.</p></details> |  |

However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50, while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset for the same category.</p></details> |  |

However, the commonly existing modality misalignment problem presents two challenges: fusing misalignment complementary features is difficult, and current methods cannot reliably locate objects in both modalities under misalignment conditions. In this paper, we propose a Decoupled Position Detection Transformer (DPDETR) to address these issues. Specifically, we explicitly define the object category, visible modality position, and infrared modality position to enable the network to learn the intrinsic relationships and output reliably positions of objects in both modalities. To fuse misaligned object features reliably, we propose a Decoupled Position Multispectral Cross-attention module that adaptively samples and aggregates multispectral complementary features with the constraint of infrared and visible reference positions. Additionally, we design a query-decoupled Multispectral Decoder structure to address the the conflict in feature focus among the three kinds of object information in our task and propose a Decoupled Position Contrastive DeNoising Training strategy to enhance the DPDETR's ability to learn decoupled positions. Experiments on DroneVehicle and KAIST datasets demonstrate significant improvements compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The code will be released at https://github.com/gjj45/DPDETR</p></details> |  |

However, CLIP still struggles with fine-grained, region-level understanding, hindering its effectiveness on these dense prediction tasks. We identify two pivotal factors required to address this limitation: semantic coherence and fine-grained vision-language alignment. Current adaptation methods often improve fine-grained alignment at the expense of semantic coherence, and often rely on extra modules or supervised fine-tuning. To overcome these issues, we propose Any-to-Any Self-Distillation (ATAS), a novel approach that simultaneously enhances semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment by leveraging own knowledge of a model across all representation levels. Unlike prior methods, ATAS uses only unlabeled images and an internal self-distillation process to refine representations of CLIP vision encoders, preserving local semantic consistency while sharpening local detail recognition. On open-vocabulary object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks, ATAS achieves substantial performance gains, outperforming baseline CLIP models. These results validate the effectiveness of our approach and underscore the importance of jointly maintaining semantic coherence and fine-grained alignment for advanced open-vocabulary dense prediction.</p></details> | Accepted at ICCV25 |

While recent advances in general motion tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these policies lack the precision and object awareness required for loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion, serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements. An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness over strong baselines.

While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |  |

However, they still underutilize two essentials: modality-specific frequency structure and long-range temporal dependencies. We present Learning Frequency and Memory-Aware Prompts, a dual-adapter framework that injects lightweight prompts into a frozen RGB tracker. A frequency-guided visual adapter adaptively transfers complementary cues across modalities by jointly calibrating spatial, channel, and frequency components, narrowing the modality gap without full fine-tuning. A multilevel memory adapter with short, long, and permanent memory stores, updates, and retrieves reliable temporal context, enabling consistent propagation across frames and robust recovery from occlusion, motion blur, and illumination changes. This unified design preserves the efficiency of prompt learning while strengthening cross-modal interaction and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event benchmarks show consistent state-of-the-art results over fully fine-tuned and adapter-based baselines, together with favorable parameter efficiency and runtime. Code and models are available at https://github.com/xuboyue1999/mmtrack.git.</p></details> |  |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, this work introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR), aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[BEVTrack: A Simple and Strong Baseline for 3D Single Object Tracking in Bird's-Eye View](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02185v7)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Single Object Tracking (SOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision and plays a critical role in applications like autonomous driving. However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability. The code will be released at https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack.</p></details> | IJCAI version |
| **[Motion-Aware Transformer for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21715v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in videos remains challenging due to complex object motions and crowded scenes. Recent DETR-based frameworks offer end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6 mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.724 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.</p></details> | Camera-ready copy |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

| **[An Analysis of Kalman Filter based Object Tracking Methods for Fast-Moving Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18451v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.</p></details> |  |

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the foundations and insights of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces much greater scene complexity, including {more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and scenarios requiring external knowledge.} We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops on MOSEv2. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and observe similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 poses challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite strong performance on existing datasets, current VOS methods still fall short under real-world complexities. Based on our analysis of the observed challenges, we further propose several practical tricks that enhance model performance.

Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines.

LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distractor-Aware Memory-Based Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13864v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on Github: https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM</p></details> |

The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page Journal paper, accepted by IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy</p></details> |
| **[T-SiamTPN: Temporal Siamese Transformer Pyramid Networks for Robust and Efficient UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12913v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations, dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters.

| **[ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT.

To address this, we present the first comprehensive, systematic investigation of this domain, encompassing data construction, model training, and an evaluation benchmark. First, we construct a large-scale dataset of 1.3 million high-quality structured image pairs derived from executable drawing programs and augmented with chain-of-thought reasoning annotations. Building on it, we train a unified model that integrates a VLM with FLUX.1 Kontext via a lightweight connector for enhanced multimodal understanding. A three-stage training curriculum enables progressive feature alignment, knowledge infusion, and reasoning-augmented generation, further boosted by an external reasoner at inference time. Finally, we introduce StructBench, a novel benchmark for generation and editing with over 1,700 challenging instances, and an accompanying evaluation metric, StructScore, which employs a multi-round Q\&A protocol to assess fine-grained factual accuracy. Evaluations of 15 models reveal that even leading closed-source systems remain far from satisfactory. Our model attains strong editing performance, and inference-time reasoning yields consistent gains across diverse architectures. By releasing the dataset, model, and benchmark, we aim to advance unified multimodal foundations for structured visuals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://structvisuals.github.io</p></details> |

During image capturing, unfavorable lighting conditions can cause contrast change and visual quality loss. While various methods have been proposed to assess the quality of images under different distortions such as blur and noise, contrast distortion has been largely overlooked as its visual impact and properties are different from other conventional types of distortions. In this paper, we propose a no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA) metric for contrast-distorted images. Using a set of contrast enhancement algorithms, we aim to generate pseudo-reference images that are visually close to the actual reference image, such that the NR problem is transformed to a Full-reference (FR) assessment with higher accuracy. To this end, a large dataset of contrast-enhanced images is produced to train a classification network that can select the most suitable contrast enhancement algorithm based on image content and distortion for pseudo-reference image generation. Finally, the evaluation is performed in the FR manner to assess the quality difference between the contrast-enhanced (pseudoreference) and degraded images. Performance evaluation of the proposed method on three databases containing contrast distortions (CCID2014, TID2013, and CSIQ), indicates the promising performance of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast constrained sampling in pre-trained diffusion models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18804v3)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large denoising diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, have been trained on billions of image-caption pairs to perform text-conditioned image generation. As a byproduct of this training, these models have acquired general knowledge about image statistics, which can be useful for other inference tasks. However, when confronted with sampling an image under new constraints, e.g. generating the missing parts of an image, using large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models is inefficient and often unreliable. Previous approaches either utilized backpropagation through the denoiser network, making them significantly slower and more memory-demanding than simple text-to-image generation, or only enforced the constraint locally, failing to capture critical long-range correlations in the sampled image. In this work, we propose an algorithm that enables fast, high-quality generation under arbitrary constraints. We show that in denoising diffusion models, we can employ an approximation to Newton's optimization method that allows us to speed up inference and avoid the expensive backpropagation operations. Our approach produces results that rival or surpass the state-of-the-art training-free inference methods while requiring a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm under both linear (inpainting, super-resolution) and non-linear (style-guided generation) constraints. An implementation is provided at https://github.com/cvlab-stonybrook/fast-constrained-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Lurks Within? Concept Auditing for Shared Diffusion Models at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14815v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation, enabling the creation of highly realistic and customized images from text prompts. With the rise of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, users can now customize powerful pre-trained models using minimal computational resources. However, the widespread sharing of fine-tuned DMs on open platforms raises growing ethical and legal concerns, as these models may inadvertently or deliberately generate sensitive or unauthorized content. Despite increasing regulatory attention on generative AI, there are currently no practical tools for systematically auditing these models before deployment. In this paper, we address the problem of concept auditing: determining whether a fine-tuned DM has learned to generate a specific target concept. Existing approaches typically rely on prompt-based input crafting and output-based image classification but they suffer from critical limitations, including prompt uncertainty, concept drift, and poor scalability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prompt-Agnostic Image-Free Auditing (PAIA), a novel, model-centric concept auditing framework. By treating the DM as the object of inspection, PAIA enables direct analysis of internal model behavior, bypassing the need for optimized prompts or generated images. We evaluate PAIA on 320 controlled models trained with curated concept datasets and 771 real-world community models sourced from a public DM sharing platform. Evaluation results show that PAIA achieves over 90% detection accuracy while reducing auditing time by 18 - 40X compared to existing baselines. To our knowledge, PAIA is the first scalable and practical solution for pre-deployment concept auditing of diffusion models, providing a practical foundation for safer and more transparent diffusion model sharing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at CCS 2025</p></details> |

However, DPO-based methods such as SPO, Diffusion-DPO, and D3PO are highly susceptible to overfitting and reward hacking, especially when the generative model is optimized to fit out-of-distribution during prolonged training. To overcome these challenges and stabilize the training of diffusion models, we introduce a self-entropy regularization mechanism in reinforcement learning from human feedback. This enhancement improves DPO training by encouraging broader exploration and greater robustness. Our regularization technique effectively mitigates reward hacking, leading to improved stability and enhanced image quality across the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating human feedback with self-entropy regularization can significantly boost image diversity and specificity, achieving state-of-the-art results on key image generation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Existing conditional generative adversarial networks often struggle to balance the dual objectives of assessing authenticity and conditional alignment of input samples within their conditional discriminators. To address this, we propose a novel discriminator design that integrates three key capabilities: unconditional discrimination, matching-aware supervision to enhance alignment sensitivity, and adaptive weighting to dynamically balance all objectives. Specifically, we introduce Sum of Naturalness and Alignment (SONA), which employs separate projections for naturalness (authenticity) and alignment in the final layer with an inductive bias, supported by dedicated objective functions and an adaptive weighting mechanism. Extensive experiments on class-conditional generation tasks show that \ours achieves superior sample quality and conditional alignment compared to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate its effectiveness in text-to-image generation, confirming the versatility and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages with 9 figures</p></details> |

The framework enables users to generate 3D-CG content solely through natural language instructions. 3Dify is built upon Dify, an open-source platform for AI application development, and incorporates several state-of-the-art LLM-related technologies such as the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). For 3D-CG generation support, 3Dify automates the operation of various Digital Content Creation (DCC) tools via MCP. When DCC tools do not support MCP-based interaction, the framework employs the Computer-Using Agent (CUA) method to automate Graphical User Interface (GUI) operations. Moreover, to enhance image generation quality, 3Dify allows users to provide feedback by selecting preferred images from multiple candidates. The LLM then learns variable patterns from these selections and applies them to subsequent generations. Furthermore, 3Dify supports the integration of locally deployed LLMs, enabling users to utilize custom-developed models and to reduce both time and monetary costs associated with external API calls by leveraging their own computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAG:Tangential Amplifying Guidance for Hallucination-Resistant Diffusion Sampling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04533v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent diffusion models achieve the state-of-the-art performance in image generation, but often suffer from semantic inconsistencies or hallucinations. While various inference-time guidance methods can enhance generation, they often operate indirectly by relying on external signals or architectural modifications, which introduces additional computational overhead. In this paper, we propose Tangential Amplifying Guidance (TAG), a more efficient and direct guidance method that operates solely on trajectory signals without modifying the underlying diffusion model. TAG leverages an intermediate sample as a projection basis and amplifies the tangential components of the estimated scores with respect to this basis to correct the sampling trajectory. We formalize this guidance process by leveraging a first-order Taylor expansion, which demonstrates that amplifying the tangential component steers the state toward higher-probability regions, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing sample quality. TAG is a plug-and-play, architecture-agnostic module that improves diffusion sampling fidelity with minimal computational addition, offering a new perspective on diffusion guidance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Yet, they often struggle to faithfully align the generated images with the input prompts. This limitation arises from synchronous denoising, where all pixels simultaneously evolve from random noise to clear images. As a result, during generation, the prompt-related regions can only reference the unrelated regions at the same noise level, failing to obtain clear context and ultimately impairing text-to-image alignment. To address this issue, we propose asynchronous diffusion models -- a novel framework that allocates distinct timesteps to different pixels and reformulates the pixel-wise denoising process. By dynamically modulating the timestep schedules of individual pixels, prompt-related regions are denoised more gradually than unrelated regions, thereby allowing them to leverage clearer inter-pixel context. Consequently, these prompt-related regions achieve better alignment in the final images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous diffusion models can significantly improve text-to-image alignment across diverse prompts.

However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisualChef: Generating Visual Aids in Cooking via Mask Inpainting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18569v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooking requires not only following instructions but also understanding, executing, and monitoring each step - a process that can be challenging without visual guidance. Although recipe images and videos offer helpful cues, they often lack consistency in focus, tools, and setup. To better support the cooking process, we introduce VisualChef, a method for generating contextual visual aids tailored to cooking scenarios. Given an initial frame and a specified action, VisualChef generates images depicting both the action's execution and the resulting appearance of the object, while preserving the initial frame's environment. Previous work aims to integrate knowledge extracted from large language models by generating detailed textual descriptions to guide image generation, which requires fine-grained visual-textual alignment and involves additional annotations. In contrast, VisualChef simplifies alignment through mask-based visual grounding. Our key insight is identifying action-relevant objects and classifying them to enable targeted modifications that reflect the intended action and outcome while maintaining a consistent environment. In addition, we propose an automated pipeline to extract high-quality initial, action, and final state frames. We evaluate VisualChef quantitatively and qualitatively on three egocentric video datasets and show its improvements over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>GCPR ...</summary><p>GCPR 2025 (oral presentation; Best Master's Thesis Award)</p></details> |

This capability is especially vital for world simulation related tasks. In this paper, we present ChronoEdit, a framework that reframes image editing as a video generation problem. First, ChronoEdit treats the input and edited images as the first and last frames of a video, allowing it to leverage large pretrained video generative models that capture not only object appearance but also the implicit physics of motion and interaction through learned temporal consistency. Second, ChronoEdit introduces a temporal reasoning stage that explicitly performs editing at inference time. Under this setting, the target frame is jointly denoised with reasoning tokens to imagine a plausible editing trajectory that constrains the solution space to physically viable transformations. The reasoning tokens are then dropped after a few steps to avoid the high computational cost of rendering a full video. To validate ChronoEdit, we introduce PBench-Edit, a new benchmark of image-prompt pairs for contexts that require physical consistency, and demonstrate that ChronoEdit surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in both visual fidelity and physical plausibility. Code and models for both the 14B and 2B variants of ChronoEdit will be released on the project page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/chronoedit</p></details> |
| **[Inference-time Scaling of Diffusion Models through Classical Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23614v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical search algorithms have long underpinned modern artificial intelligence. In this work, we tackle the challenge of inference-time control in diffusion models -- adapting generated outputs to meet diverse test-time objectives -- using principles from classical search. We propose a general framework that orchestrates local and global search to efficiently navigate the generative space. It employs a theoretically grounded local search via annealed Langevin MCMC and performs compute-efficient global exploration using breadth-first and depth-first tree search. We evaluate our approach on a range of challenging domains, including planning, offline reinforcement learning, and image generation. Across all tasks, we observe significant gains in both performance and efficiency. These results show that classical search provides a principled and practical foundation for inference-time scaling in diffusion models.

This conventional approach treats tokens as a flat vocabulary, disregarding the intrinsic structure of the token embedding space where proximity often correlates with semantic similarity. This oversight results in a highly complex prediction task, which hinders training efficiency and limits final generation quality. To resolve this, we propose Manifold-Aligned Semantic Clustering (MASC), a principled framework that constructs a hierarchical semantic tree directly from the codebook's intrinsic structure. MASC employs a novel geometry-aware distance metric and a density-driven agglomerative construction to model the underlying manifold of the token embeddings. By transforming the flat, high-dimensional prediction task into a structured, hierarchical one, MASC introduces a beneficial inductive bias that significantly simplifies the learning problem for the AR model. MASC is designed as a plug-and-play module, and our extensive experiments validate its effectiveness: it accelerates training by up to 57% and significantly improves generation quality, reducing the FID of LlamaGen-XL from 2.87 to 2.58. MASC elevates existing AR frameworks to be highly competitive with state-of-the-art methods, establishing that structuring the prediction space is as crucial as architectural innovation for scalable generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

We introduce World-To-Image, a novel framework that bridges this gap by empowering T2I generation with agent-driven world knowledge. We design an agent that dynamically searches the web to retrieve images for concepts unknown to the base model. This information is then used to perform multimodal prompt optimization, steering powerful generative backbones toward an accurate synthesis. Critically, our evaluation goes beyond traditional metrics, utilizing modern assessments like LLMGrader and ImageReward to measure true semantic fidelity. Our experiments show that World-To-Image substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both semantic alignment and visual aesthetics, achieving +8.1% improvement in accuracy-to-prompt on our curated NICE benchmark. Our framework achieves these results with high efficiency in less than three iterations, paving the way for T2I systems that can better reflect the ever-changing real world. Our demo code is available here\footnote{https://github.com/mhson-kyle/World-To-Image}.</p></details> |  |
| **[ObCLIP: Oblivious CLoud-Device Hybrid Image Generation with Privacy Preservation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04153v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models have gained significant popularity due to their remarkable capabilities in image generation, albeit at the cost of intensive computation requirement. Meanwhile, despite their widespread deployment in inference services such as Midjourney, concerns about the potential leakage of sensitive information in uploaded user prompts have arisen. Existing solutions either lack rigorous privacy guarantees or fail to strike an effective balance between utility and efficiency. To bridge this gap, we propose ObCLIP, a plug-and-play safeguard that enables oblivious cloud-device hybrid generation. By oblivious, each input prompt is transformed into a set of semantically similar candidate prompts that differ only in sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, ethnicity). The cloud server processes all candidate prompts without knowing which one is the real one, thus preventing any prompt leakage. To mitigate server cost, only a small portion of denoising steps is performed upon the large cloud model. The intermediate latents are then sent back to the client, which selects the targeted latent and completes the remaining denoising using a small device model. Additionally, we analyze and incorporate several cache-based accelerations that leverage temporal and batch redundancy, effectively reducing computation cost with minimal utility degradation. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that ObCLIP provides rigorous privacy and comparable utility to cloud models with slightly increased server cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Variational Diffusion Unlearning: A Variational Inference Framework for Unlearning in Diffusion Models under Data Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04058v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a responsible and safe deployment of diffusion models in various domains, regulating the generated outputs from these models is desirable because such models could generate undesired, violent, and obscene outputs. To tackle this problem, recent works use machine unlearning methodology to forget training data points containing these undesired features from pre-trained generative models. However, these methods proved to be ineffective in data-constrained settings where the whole training dataset is inaccessible. Thus, the principal objective of this work is to propose a machine unlearning methodology that can prevent the generation of outputs containing undesired features from a pre-trained diffusion model in such a data-constrained setting. Our proposed method, termed as Variational Diffusion Unlearning (VDU), is a computationally efficient method that only requires access to a subset of training data containing undesired features. Our approach is inspired by the variational inference framework with the objective of minimizing a loss function consisting of two terms: plasticity inducer and stability regularizer. Plasticity inducer reduces the log-likelihood of the undesired training data points, while the stability regularizer, essential for preventing loss of image generation quality, regularizes the model in parameter space. We validate the effectiveness of our method through comprehensive experiments for both class unlearning and feature unlearning. For class unlearning, we unlearn some user-identified classes from MNIST, CIFAR-10, and tinyImageNet datasets from a pre-trained unconditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Similarly, for feature unlearning, we unlearn the generation of certain high-level features from a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model</p></details> |  |
| **[TRCE: Towards Reliable Malicious Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07389v2)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models enable photorealistic image generation, but they also risk producing malicious content, such as NSFW images. To mitigate risk, concept erasure methods are studied to facilitate the model to unlearn specific concepts. However, current studies struggle to fully erase malicious concepts implicitly embedded in prompts (e.g., metaphorical expressions or adversarial prompts) while preserving the model's normal generation capability. To address this challenge, our study proposes TRCE, using a two-stage concept erasure strategy to achieve an effective trade-off between reliable erasure and knowledge preservation. Firstly, TRCE starts by erasing the malicious semantics implicitly embedded in textual prompts. By identifying a critical mapping objective(i.e., the [EoT] embedding), we optimize the cross-attention layers to map malicious prompts to contextually similar prompts but with safe concepts. This step prevents the model from being overly influenced by malicious semantics during the denoising process. Following this, considering the deterministic properties of the sampling trajectory of the diffusion model, TRCE further steers the early denoising prediction toward the safe direction and away from the unsafe one through contrastive learning, thus further avoiding the generation of malicious content. Finally, we conduct comprehensive evaluations of TRCE on multiple malicious concept erasure benchmarks, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness in erasing malicious concepts while better preserving the model's original generation ability. The code is available at: http://github.com/ddgoodgood/TRCE. CAUTION: This paper includes model-generated content that may contain offensive material.</p></details> | accepted by ICCV2025 |

However, existing datasets focus on these aspects separately, limiting the development of integrated diagnostic approaches and restricting AI-driven advancements in AHP analysis. To address this gap, we introduce PoseGaze-AHP, a novel 3D dataset that synchronously captures head pose and gaze movement information for ocular-induced AHP assessment. Structured clinical data were extracted from medical literature using large language models (LLMs) through an iterative process with the Claude 3.5 Sonnet model, combining stepwise, hierarchical, and complex prompting strategies. The extracted records were systematically imputed and transformed into 3D representations using the Neural Head Avatar (NHA) framework. The dataset includes 7,920 images generated from two head textures, covering a broad spectrum of ocular conditions. The extraction method achieved an overall accuracy of 91.92%, demonstrating its reliability for clinical dataset construction. PoseGaze-AHP is the first publicly available resource tailored for AI-driven ocular-induced AHP diagnosis, supporting the development of accurate and privacy-compliant diagnostic tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint version of a manuscript under review.

To identify this discrepancy, we introduce \textbf{Mirage}, a curated dataset comprising a diverse range of AI-generated images exhibiting visible artifacts, where current state-of-the-art detection methods largely fail. Furthermore, we investigate whether Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), which are increasingly employed as substitutes for human judgment in various tasks, can be leveraged for explainable AI image detection. Our experiments on both Mirage and existing benchmark datasets demonstrate that while LVLMs are highly effective at detecting AI-generated images with visible artifacts, their performance declines when confronted with images lacking such cues.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM M...</summary><p>ACM MM'25, MALLM Workshop</p></details> |

However, this advantage often comes with a critical drawback: limited diversity, as outputs tend to collapse into similar modes under strong text guidance. Existing approaches typically optimize intermediate latents or text conditions during inference, but these methods deliver only modest gains or remain sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we introduce Contrastive Noise Optimization, a simple yet effective method that addresses the diversity issue from a distinct perspective. Unlike prior techniques that adapt intermediate latents, our approach shapes the initial noise to promote diverse outputs. Specifically, we develop a contrastive loss defined in the Tweedie data space and optimize a batch of noise latents. Our contrastive optimization repels instances within the batch to maximize diversity while keeping them anchored to a reference sample to preserve fidelity. We further provide theoretical insights into the mechanism of this preprocessing to substantiate its effectiveness. Extensive experiments across multiple T2I backbones demonstrate that our approach achieves a superior quality-diversity Pareto frontier while remaining robust to hyperparameter choices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model-Guided Microstimulation Steers Primate Visual Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03684v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain stimulation is a powerful tool for understanding cortical function and holds promise for therapeutic interventions in neuropsychiatric disorders. Initial visual prosthetics apply electric microstimulation to early visual cortex which can evoke percepts of simple symbols such as letters. However, these approaches are fundamentally limited by hardware constraints and the low-level representational properties of this cortical region. In contrast, higher-level visual areas encode more complex object representations and therefore constitute a promising target for stimulation - but determining representational targets that reliably evoke object-level percepts constitutes a major challenge. We here introduce a computational framework to causally model and guide stimulation of high-level cortex, comprising three key components: (1) a perturbation module that translates microstimulation parameters into spatial changes to neural activity, (2) topographic models that capture the spatial organization of cortical neurons and thus enable prototyping of stimulation experiments, and (3) a mapping procedure that links model-optimized stimulation sites back to primate cortex. Applying this framework in two macaque monkeys performing a visual recognition task, model-predicted stimulation experiments produced significant in-vivo changes in perceptual choices. Per-site model predictions and monkey behavior were strongly correlated, underscoring the promise of model-guided stimulation. Image generation further revealed a qualitative similarity between in-silico stimulation of face-selective sites and a patient's report of facephenes. This proof-of-principle establishes a foundation for model-guided microstimulation and points toward next-generation visual prosthetics capable of inducing more complex visual experiences.</p></details> |  |

Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03597v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.

Unlike autoregressive models that enforce rigid causal ordering between text and image generation, OneFlow combines an insertion-based Edit Flow for discrete text tokens with Flow Matching for image latents. OneFlow enables concurrent text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs. OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and natural reasoning-like generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://johnlnguyen.com/oneflow</p></details> |

Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[SteerDiff: Steering towards Safe Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02710v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have drawn attention for their ability to generate high-quality images with precise text alignment. However, these models can also be misused to produce inappropriate content. Existing safety measures, which typically rely on text classifiers or ControlNet-like approaches, are often insufficient. Traditional text classifiers rely on large-scale labeled datasets and can be easily bypassed by rephrasing. As diffusion models continue to scale, fine-tuning these safeguards becomes increasingly challenging and lacks flexibility. Recent red-teaming attack researches further underscore the need for a new paradigm to prevent the generation of inappropriate content. In this paper, we introduce SteerDiff, a lightweight adaptor module designed to act as an intermediary between user input and the diffusion model, ensuring that generated images adhere to ethical and safety standards with little to no impact on usability. SteerDiff identifies and manipulates inappropriate concepts within the text embedding space to guide the model away from harmful outputs. We conduct extensive experiments across various concept unlearning tasks to evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. Furthermore, we benchmark SteerDiff against multiple red-teaming strategies to assess its robustness. Finally, we explore the potential of SteerDiff for concept forgetting tasks, demonstrating its versatility in text-conditioned image generation.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce PQGAN, a quantised image autoencoder that integrates PQ into the well-known vector quantisation (VQ) framework of VQGAN. PQGAN achieves a noticeable improvement over state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction performance, including both quantisation methods and their continuous counterparts. We achieve a PSNR score of 37dB, where prior work achieves 27dB, and are able to reduce the FID, LPIPS, and CMMD score by up to 96%. Our key to success is a thorough analysis of the interaction between codebook size, embedding dimensionality, and subspace factorisation, with vector and scalar quantisation as special cases. We obtain novel findings, such that the performance of VQ and PQ behaves in opposite ways when scaling the embedding dimension. Furthermore, our analysis shows performance trends for PQ that help guide optimal hyperparameter selection. Finally, we demonstrate that PQGAN can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models. This enables either a significantly faster and more compute-efficient generation, or a doubling of the output resolution at no additional cost, positioning PQ as a strong extension for discrete latent representation in image synthesis.</p></details> |  |

Forgery Image Detection and Localization (FIDL) thus emerges as essential for maintaining information integrity and societal security. Despite impressive performances by existing domain-specific detection methods, their practical applicability remains limited, primarily due to their narrow specialization, poor cross-domain generalization, and the absence of an integrated adaptive framework. To address these issues, we propose UniShield, the novel multi-agent-based unified system capable of detecting and localizing image forgeries across diverse domains, including image manipulation, document manipulation, DeepFake, and AI-generated images. UniShield innovatively integrates a perception agent with a detection agent. The perception agent intelligently analyzes image features to dynamically select suitable detection models, while the detection agent consolidates various expert detectors into a unified framework and generates interpretable reports. Extensive experiments show that UniShield achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing both existing unified approaches and domain-specific detectors, highlighting its superior practicality, adaptiveness, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
