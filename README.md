| **[Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22645v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as "a photo of a [CLASS]", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual concepts. For example, recognizing "cat" versus "car" depends on coarse-grained cues, while distinguishing "cat" from "lion" requires fine-grained details. Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoCLIP-Lite: Efficient Video Recognition by Fusing CLIP with Motion Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17084v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCLIP-Lite.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees. We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21153v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mammo-CLIP Dissect: A Framework for Analysing Mammography Concepts in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21102v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists' workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories (e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g., density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept learning. Code and concept set are available: https://github.com/Suaiba/Mammo-CLIP-Dissect.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIPin: A Non-contrastive Plug-in to CLIP for Multimodal Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06434v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is available at https://github.com/T6Yang/CLIPin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting ResNet-based CLIP via Neuron-Attention Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19943v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic, represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second, we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability.

| **[Efficiently Disentangling CLIP for Multi-Object Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP excel at recognizing the single, prominent object in a scene. However, they struggle in complex scenes containing multiple objects. We identify a fundamental reason for this limitation: VLM feature space exhibits excessive mutual feature information (MFI), where the features of one class contain substantial information about other, unrelated classes. This high MFI becomes evident during class-specific queries, as unrelated objects are activated alongside the queried class. To address this limitation, we propose DCLIP, an efficient framework that learns an optimal level of mutual information while adding only minimal learnable parameters to a frozen VLM. DCLIP uses two complementary losses: a novel MFI Loss that regulates class feature similarity to prevent excessive overlap while preserving necessary shared information, and the Asymmetric Loss (ASL) that aligns image features with the disentangled text features. Through this disentanglement, DCLIP reduces excessive inter-class similarity by 30%. On multi-label recognition, DCLIP performs favorably over SOTA approaches on VOC2007 and COCO-14 while using 75% fewer training parameters. For zero-shot semantic segmentation, it shows improved performance across six benchmark datasets. These results highlight the importance of feature disentanglement for multi-object perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-GPPO: Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP Can Understand Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03251v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Pattern Recognition, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training CLIP against Data Poisoning with Optimal Transport-based Matching and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18717v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Main |
| **[GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[CardiacCLIP: Video-based CLIP Adaptation for LVEF Prediction in a Few-shot Manner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17065v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echocardiography is a vital non-invasive modality for cardiac assessment, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) serving as a key indicator of heart function. Existing LVEF estimation methods depend on large-scale annotated video datasets, which are costly and limit adaptability across various clinical settings. Recent vision-language models for echocardiography, such as EchoCLIP, apply image-to-text pretraining but fail to capture crucial temporal dynamics and localized cardiac structures essential for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose CardiacCLIP, a video-based framework that enhances LVEF prediction through attention-based frame aggregation and multi-resolution input scaling. Specifically, we introduce MFL (Multi Frame Learning), a novel attention-based mechanism for selectively fusing informative frames, and EchoZoom, a multi-scale feature extraction strategy that refines spatial representations of cardiac structures. As a novel adaptation of CLIP models for few-shot echocardiogram video analysis, our approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing MAE by 2.07 on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset under 1-shot setting. The code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/CardiacCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Antidote: Class-Wise Prompt Tuning for Purifying Backdoors in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19269v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit impressive representational capabilities for multimodal data, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. To alleviate the threat, existing defense strategies primarily focus on fine-tuning the entire suspicious model. However, the substantial model parameters increase the difficulty of reaching a stable and consistent optimization direction, limiting their resistance against state-of-the-art attacks and often resulting in a degradation of clean accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose Class-wise Backdoor Prompt Tuning (CBPT), an efficient and effective defense mechanism that operates on text prompts to indirectly purify poisoned CLIP. Specifically, we first employ the advanced contrastive learning via carefully crafted positive and negative samples, to effectively invert the backdoor triggers that are potentially adopted by the attacker. Once the dummy trigger is established, we leverage three well-designed loss functions to optimize these class-wise text prompts, modifying the model's decision boundary and further reclassifying the feature regions affected by backdoor triggers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBPT significantly mitigates backdoor threats while preserving model utility, e.g. an average Clean Accuracy (CA) of 58.83% and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.39% across seven mainstream backdoor attacks. These results underscore the superiority of our prompt purifying design to strengthen CLIP's robustness against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Brain Signal Generation for Visual Prosthesis with CLIP Guided Multimodal Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present, to our knowledge, the first image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed framework comprises two key components: a pretrained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that reconstructs brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules capture the complex interplay between visual features and brain signal representations, enabling fine-grained alignment during generation. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals. We also present visualizations of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning the Paradox: How CLIP's Most Informative Heads Enhance Performance While Amplifying Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11103v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is one of the most popular foundation models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks, yet little is known about its inner workings. As CLIP is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is becoming even more critical to understand its limitations and embedded social biases to mitigate potentially harmful downstream consequences. However, the question of what internal mechanisms drive both the impressive capabilities as well as problematic shortcomings of CLIP has largely remained unanswered. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations which amplify social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models, eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no keyword list is used.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 26th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE), scheduled for 15-17 December 2025 in Marrakech, Morocco</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

| **[When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.</p></details> | BIBM |

However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p></details> |  |

| **[CapRL: Stimulating Dense Image Caption Capabilities via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22647v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image captioning is a fundamental task that bridges the visual and linguistic domains, playing a critical role in pre-training Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Current state-of-the-art captioning models are typically trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), a paradigm that relies on expensive, non-scalable data annotated by humans or proprietary models. This approach often leads to models that memorize specific ground-truth answers, limiting their generality and ability to generate diverse, creative descriptions. To overcome the limitation of SFT, we propose applying the Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) paradigm to the open-ended task of image captioning. A primary challenge, however, is designing an objective reward function for the inherently subjective nature of what constitutes a "good" caption. We introduce Captioning Reinforcement Learning (CapRL), a novel training framework that redefines caption quality through its utility: a high-quality caption should enable a non-visual language model to accurately answer questions about the corresponding image. CapRL employs a decoupled two-stage pipeline where an LVLM generates a caption, and the objective reward is derived from the accuracy of a separate, vision-free LLM answering Multiple-Choice Questions based solely on that caption. As the first study to apply RLVR to the subjective image captioning task, we demonstrate that CapRL significantly enhances multiple settings. Pretraining on the CapRL-5M caption dataset annotated by CapRL-3B results in substantial gains across 12 benchmarks. Moreover, within the Prism Framework for caption quality evaluation, CapRL achieves performance comparable to Qwen2.5-VL-72B, while exceeding the baseline by an average margin of 8.4%.

| **[WebGen-Agent: Enhancing Interactive Website Generation with Multi-Level Feedback and Step-Level Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22644v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance on repository-level code-generation tasks. However, for tasks such as website codebase generation, which depend heavily on visual effects and user-interaction feedback, current code agents rely only on simple code execution for feedback and verification. This approach fails to capture the actual quality of the generated code. In this paper, we propose WebGen-Agent, a novel website-generation agent that leverages comprehensive and multi-level visual feedback to iteratively generate and refine the website codebase. Detailed and expressive text descriptions and suggestions regarding the screenshots and GUI-agent testing of the websites are generated by a visual language model (VLM), together with scores that quantify their quality. The screenshot and GUI-agent scores are further integrated with a backtracking and select-best mechanism, enhancing the performance of the agent. Utilizing the accurate visual scores inherent in the WebGen-Agent workflow, we further introduce \textit{Step-GRPO with Screenshot and GUI-agent Feedback} to improve the ability of LLMs to act as the reasoning engine of WebGen-Agent. By using the screenshot and GUI-agent scores at each step as the reward in Step-GRPO, we provide a dense and reliable process supervision signal, which effectively improves the model's website-generation ability. On the WebGen-Bench dataset, WebGen-Agent increases the accuracy of Claude-3.5-Sonnet from 26.4% to 51.9% and its appearance score from 3.0 to 3.9, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art agent system. Additionally, our Step-GRPO training approach increases the accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct from 38.9% to 45.4% and raises the appearance score from 3.4 to 3.7.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient Online Exploration for Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22633v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF), which learns a reward model from human preference data and then optimizes a policy to favor preferred responses, has emerged as a central paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. In this paper, we investigate exploration principles for online RLHF, where one seeks to adaptively collect new preference data to refine both the reward model and the policy in a data-efficient manner. By examining existing optimism-based exploration algorithms, we identify a drawback in their sampling protocol: they tend to gather comparisons that fail to reduce the most informative uncertainties in reward differences, and we prove lower bounds showing that such methods can incur linear regret over exponentially long horizons. Motivated by this insight, we propose a new exploration scheme that directs preference queries toward reducing uncertainty in reward differences most relevant to policy improvement. Under a multi-armed bandit model of RLHF, we establish regret bounds of order $T^{(\beta+1)/(\beta+2)}$, where $\beta>0$ is a hyperparameter that balances reward maximization against mitigating distribution shift. To our knowledge, this is the first online RLHF algorithm with regret scaling polynomially in all model parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn Globally, Speak Locally: Bridging the Gaps in Multilingual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05418v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved strong performance in domains like mathematics, factual question answering, and code generation, yet their ability to reason on these tasks in different languages remains underdeveloped. Especially for low-resource languages such as Swahili or Thai, LLMs can often misinterpret prompts or default to reasoning in English. This implicit bias toward high-resource languages undermines factual accuracy, interpretability, and trust. We propose M2A, a novel method that combines multi-scale multilingual alignment with language-consistency rewards on machine-translated questions, training models to reason directly and accurately in the target language. Furthermore, existing multilingual benchmarks only evaluate on final answers, overlooking whether reasoning occurs in the intended language. To close this gap, we introduce GeoFact-X, a geography-based multilingual factual reasoning benchmark together with reasoning traces in five languages: English, Hindi, Japanese, Swahili, and Thai. Our results show that M2A significantly enhances multilingual reasoning fidelity in both mathematical and factual reasoning tasks, highlighting that reasoning-aware multilingual reinforcement learning is crucial for robust cross-lingual generalization. https://jd730.github.io/projects/M2A_GeoFact-X</p></details> |  |
| **[SPARK: Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22624v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) increasingly use Reinforcement Learning (RL) for post-pretraining, such as RL with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for objective tasks and RL from Human Feedback (RLHF) for subjective tasks. However, RLHF incurs high costs and potential reward-policy mismatch due to reliance on human preferences, while RLVR still wastes supervision by discarding rollouts and correctness signals after each update. To address these challenges, we introduce the Synergistic Policy And Reward Co-Evolving Framework (SPARK), an efficient, on-policy, and stable method that builds on RLVR. Instead of discarding rollouts and correctness data, SPARK recycles this valuable information to simultaneously train the model itself as a generative reward model. This auxiliary training uses a mix of objectives, such as pointwise reward score, pairwise comparison, and evaluation conditioned on further-reflection responses, to teach the model to evaluate and improve its own responses. Our process eliminates the need for a separate reward model and costly human preference data. SPARK creates a positive co-evolving feedback loop: improved reward accuracy yields better policy gradients, which in turn produce higher-quality rollouts that further refine the reward model. Our unified framework supports test-time scaling via self-reflection without external reward models and their associated costs. We show that SPARK achieves significant performance gains on multiple LLM and LVLM models and multiple reasoning, reward models, and general benchmarks. For example, SPARK-VL-7B achieves an average 9.7% gain on 7 reasoning benchmarks, 12.1% on 2 reward benchmarks, and 1.5% on 8 general benchmarks over the baselines, demonstrating robustness and broad generalization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project:https://github.com/InternLM/Spark</p></details> |

Existing definitions of decentralization, however -- the 'D' in DAO -- fall short of capturing the key properties characteristic of diverse and equitable participation. This work proposes a new framework for measuring DAO decentralization called Voting-Bloc Entropy (VBE, pronounced ''vibe''). VBE is based on the idea that voters with closely aligned interests act as a centralizing force and should be modeled as such. VBE formalizes this notion by measuring the similarity of participants' utility functions across a set of voting rounds. Unlike prior, ad hoc definitions of decentralization, VBE derives from first principles: We introduce a simple (yet powerful) reinforcement learning-based conceptual model for voting, that in turn implies VBE. We first show VBE's utility as a theoretical tool. We prove a number of results about the (de)centralizing effects of vote delegation, proposal bundling, bribery, etc. that are overlooked in previous notions of DAO decentralization. Our results lead to practical suggestions for enhancing DAO decentralization. We also show how VBE can be used empirically by presenting measurement studies and VBE-based governance experiments. We make the tools we developed for these results available to the community in the form of open-source artifacts in order to facilitate future study of DAO decentralization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper published in USENIX Security 2025</p></details> |
| **[Benefits and Pitfalls of Reinforcement Learning for Language Model Planning: A Theoretical Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22613v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent reinforcement learning (RL) methods have substantially enhanced the planning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet the theoretical basis for their effectiveness remains elusive. In this work, we investigate RL's benefits and limitations through a tractable graph-based abstraction, focusing on policy gradient (PG) and Q-learning methods. Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning. Finally, applying our framework to the real-world planning benchmark Blocksworld, we confirm that these behaviors manifest in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantile Advantage Estimation for Entropy-Safe Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22611v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) strengthens LLM reasoning, but training often oscillates between {entropy collapse} and {entropy explosion}. We trace both hazards to the mean baseline used in value-free RL (e.g., GRPO and DAPO), which improperly penalizes negative-advantage samples under reward outliers. We propose {Quantile Advantage Estimation} (QAE), replacing the mean with a group-wise K-quantile baseline. QAE induces a response-level, two-regime gate: on hard queries (p <= 1 - K) it reinforces rare successes, while on easy queries (p > 1 - K) it targets remaining failures. Under first-order softmax updates, we prove {two-sided entropy safety}, giving lower and upper bounds on one-step entropy change that curb explosion and prevent collapse. Empirically, this minimal modification stabilizes entropy, sparsifies credit assignment (with tuned K, roughly 80% of responses receive zero advantage), and yields sustained pass@1 gains on Qwen3-8B/14B-Base across AIME 2024/2025 and AMC 2023. These results identify {baseline design} -- rather than token-level heuristics -- as the primary mechanism for scaling RLVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learn the Ropes, Then Trust the Wins: Self-imitation with Progressive Exploration for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22601v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is the dominant paradigm for sharpening strategic tool use capabilities of LLMs on long-horizon, sparsely-rewarded agent tasks, yet it faces a fundamental challenge of exploration-exploitation trade-off. Existing studies stimulate exploration through the lens of policy entropy, but such mechanical entropy maximization is prone to RL training instability due to the multi-turn distribution shifting. In this paper, we target the progressive exploration-exploitation balance under the guidance of the agent own experiences without succumbing to either entropy collapsing or runaway divergence. We propose SPEAR, a curriculum-based self-imitation learning (SIL) recipe for training agentic LLMs. It extends the vanilla SIL framework, where a replay buffer stores self-generated promising trajectories for off-policy update, by gradually steering the policy evolution within a well-balanced range of entropy across stages. Specifically, our approach incorporates a curriculum to manage the exploration process, utilizing intrinsic rewards to foster skill-level exploration and facilitating action-level exploration through SIL. At first, the auxiliary tool call reward plays a critical role in the accumulation of tool-use skills, enabling broad exposure to the unfamiliar distributions of the environment feedback with an upward entropy trend. As training progresses, self-imitation gets strengthened to exploit existing successful patterns from replayed experiences for comparative action-level exploration, accelerating solution iteration without unbounded entropy growth. To further stabilize training, we recalibrate the advantages of experiences in the replay buffer to address the potential policy drift. Reugularizations such as the clipping of tokens with high covariance between probability and advantage are introduced to the trajectory-level entropy control to curb over-confidence.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |

Efficient exploration requires selecting budget-constrained paths that maximize information gain. Despite advances in autonomous exploration, existing algorithms still fall short of human performance, particularly in structured environments where predictive cues exist but are underutilized. Guided by insights from our user study, we introduce MapExRL, which improves robot exploration efficiency in structured indoor environments by enabling longer-horizon planning through a learned policy and global map predictions. Unlike many learning-based exploration methods that use motion primitives as the action space, our approach leverages frontiers for more efficient model learning and longer horizon reasoning. Our framework generates global map predictions from the observed map, which our policy utilizes, along with the prediction uncertainty, estimated sensor coverage, frontier distance, and remaining distance budget, to assess the strategic long-term value of frontiers. By leveraging multiple frontier scoring methods and additional context, our policy makes more informed decisions at each stage of the exploration. We evaluate our framework on a real-world indoor map dataset, achieving up to an 18.8% improvement over the strongest state-of-the-art baseline, with even greater gains compared to conventional frontier-based algorithms.

We identify a critical failure mode unique to this setting: the exploration-exploitation cascade failure. This cascade begins with early-stage policy premature convergence, where sparse feedback causes agents to commit to flawed, low-entropy strategies. Subsequently, agents enter late-stage policy collapse, where conventional entropy regularization becomes counterproductive, promoting chaotic exploration that destabilizes training. We propose Entropy-regularized Policy Optimization (EPO), a general framework that breaks this failure cycle through three synergistic mechanisms: (1) adopting entropy regularization in multi-turn settings to enhance exploration, (2) an entropy smoothing regularizer that bounds policy entropy within historical averages to prevent abrupt fluctuations, and (3) adaptive phase-based weighting that balances exploration and exploitation across training. Our analysis justifies that EPO guarantees monotonically decreasing entropy variance while maintaining convergence. EPO achieves up to 152% performance improvement on ScienceWorld and up to 19.8% on ALFWorld. Our work demonstrates that multi-turn sparse-reward settings require fundamentally different entropy control than traditional RL, with broad implications for LLM agent training.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Parameters to Behavior: Unsupervised Compression of the Policy Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22566v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite its recent successes, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) is notoriously sample-inefficient. We argue that this inefficiency stems from the standard practice of optimizing policies directly in the high-dimensional and highly redundant parameter space $\Theta$. This challenge is greatly compounded in multi-task settings. In this work, we develop a novel, unsupervised approach that compresses the policy parameter space $\Theta$ into a low-dimensional latent space $\mathcal{Z}$. We train a generative model $g:\mathcal{Z}\to\Theta$ by optimizing a behavioral reconstruction loss, which ensures that the latent space is organized by functional similarity rather than proximity in parameterization. We conjecture that the inherent dimensionality of this manifold is a function of the environment's complexity, rather than the size of the policy network. We validate our approach in continuous control domains, showing that the parameterization of standard policy networks can be compressed up to five orders of magnitude while retaining most of its expressivity. As a byproduct, we show that the learned manifold enables task-specific adaptation via Policy Gradient operating in the latent space $\mathcal{Z}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Activation Function Design Sustains Plasticity in Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22562v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) training regimes, activation functions have been benchmarked extensively, and their differences often shrink once model size and optimization are tuned. In continual learning, however, the picture is different: beyond catastrophic forgetting, models can progressively lose the ability to adapt (referred to as loss of plasticity) and the role of the non-linearity in this failure mode remains underexplored. We show that activation choice is a primary, architecture-agnostic lever for mitigating plasticity loss. Building on a property-level analysis of negative-branch shape and saturation behavior, we introduce two drop-in nonlinearities (Smooth-Leaky and Randomized Smooth-Leaky) and evaluate them in two complementary settings: (i) supervised class-incremental benchmarks and (ii) reinforcement learning with non-stationary MuJoCo environments designed to induce controlled distribution and dynamics shifts. We also provide a simple stress protocol and diagnostics that link the shape of the activation to the adaptation under change. The takeaway is straightforward: thoughtful activation design offers a lightweight, domain-general way to sustain plasticity in continual learning without extra capacity or task-specific tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[StepORLM: A Self-Evolving Framework With Generative Process Supervision For Operations Research Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22558v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities for solving Operations Research (OR) problems. While reinforcement learning serves as a powerful paradigm for LLM training on OR problems, existing works generally face two key limitations. First, outcome reward suffers from the credit assignment problem, where correct final answers can reinforce flawed reasoning. Second, conventional discriminative process supervision is myopic, failing to evaluate the interdependent steps of OR modeling holistically. To this end, we introduce StepORLM, a novel self-evolving framework with generative process supervision. At its core, StepORLM features a co-evolutionary loop where a policy model and a generative process reward model (GenPRM) iteratively improve on each other. This loop is driven by a dual-feedback mechanism: definitive, outcome-based verification from an external solver, and nuanced, holistic process evaluation from the GenPRM. The combined signal is used to align the policy via Weighted Direct Preference Optimization (W-DPO) and simultaneously refine the GenPRM. Our resulting 8B-parameter StepORLM establishes a new state-of-the-art across six benchmarks, significantly outperforming vastly larger generalist models, agentic methods, and specialized baselines. Moreover, the co-evolved GenPRM is able to act as a powerful and universally applicable process verifier, substantially boosting the inference scaling performance of both our own model and other existing LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intention-driven Lane Change Framework Considering Heterogeneous Dynamic Cooperation in Mixed-traffic Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22550v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-traffic environments, where autonomous vehicles (AVs) interact with diverse human-driven vehicles (HVs), unpredictable intentions and heterogeneous behaviors make safe and efficient lane change maneuvers highly challenging. Existing methods often oversimplify these interactions by assuming uniform patterns. We propose an intention-driven lane change framework that integrates driving-style recognition, cooperation-aware decision-making, and coordinated motion planning. A deep learning classifier trained on the NGSIM dataset identifies human driving styles in real time. A cooperation score with intrinsic and interactive components estimates surrounding drivers' intentions and quantifies their willingness to cooperate with the ego vehicle. Decision-making combines behavior cloning with inverse reinforcement learning to determine whether a lane change should be initiated. For trajectory generation, model predictive control is integrated with IRL-based intention inference to produce collision-free and socially compliant maneuvers. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves 94.2\% accuracy and 94.3\% F1-score, outperforming rule-based and learning-based baselines by 4-15\% in lane change recognition. These results highlight the benefit of modeling inter-driver heterogeneity and demonstrate the potential of the framework to advance context-aware and human-like autonomous driving in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |

However, this paradigm is ill-suited for navigating social situations, which induce an interpretive process of analyzing ambiguous cues that rarely yield a definitive outcome. To bridge this gap, we introduce Cognitive Reasoning, a paradigm modeled on human social cognition. It formulates the interpretive process into a structured cognitive flow of interconnected cognitive units (e.g., observation or attribution), which combine adaptively to enable effective social thinking and responses. We then propose CogFlow, a complete framework that instills this capability in LLMs. CogFlow first curates a dataset of cognitive flows by simulating the associative and progressive nature of human thought via tree-structured planning. After instilling the basic cognitive reasoning capability via supervised fine-tuning, CogFlow adopts reinforcement learning to enable the model to improve itself via trial and error, guided by a multi-objective reward that optimizes both cognitive flow and response quality. Extensive experiments show that CogFlow effectively enhances the social cognitive capabilities of LLMs, and even humans, leading to more effective social decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repos...</summary><p>Repository: https://github.com/thu-coai/CogFlow</p></details> |
| **[Learning Personalized Driving Styles via Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10434v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating human-like and adaptive trajectories is essential for autonomous driving in dynamic environments. While generative models have shown promise in synthesizing feasible trajectories, they often fail to capture the nuanced variability of personalized driving styles due to dataset biases and distributional shifts. To address this, we introduce TrajHF, a human feedback-driven finetuning framework for generative trajectory models, designed to align motion planning with diverse driving styles. TrajHF incorporates multi-conditional denoiser and reinforcement learning with human feedback to refine multi-modal trajectory generation beyond conventional imitation learning. This enables better alignment with human driving preferences while maintaining safety and feasibility constraints. TrajHF achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art on NavSim benchmark. TrajHF sets a new paradigm for personalized and adaptable trajectory generation in autonomous driving.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

To improve their ability to solve complex problems requiring multi-step reasoning, recent research leverages process reward modeling to provide fine-grained feedback at each step of the reasoning process for reinforcement learning (RL), but it predominantly focuses on English. In this paper, we tackle the critical challenge of extending process reward models (PRMs) to multilingual settings. To achieve this, we train multilingual PRMs on a dataset spanning seven languages, which is translated from English. Through comprehensive evaluations on two widely used reasoning benchmarks across 11 languages, we demonstrate that multilingual PRMs not only improve average accuracy but also reduce early-stage reasoning errors. Furthermore, our results highlight the sensitivity of multilingual PRMs to both the number of training languages and the volume of English data, while also uncovering the benefits arising from more candidate responses and trainable parameters. This work opens promising avenues for robust multilingual applications in complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. In addition, we release the code to foster research along this line.</p></details> |  |

A capable household robot should recognize ambiguity and ask relevant clarification questions to infer the user intent accurately, leading to more effective task execution. To study this problem, we introduce the Ask-to-Act task, where an embodied agent is tasked with a single or multi-object rearrangement task using an under-specified instruction in a home environment. The agent must strategically ask minimal, yet relevant, clarification questions to resolve ambiguity while navigating under partial observability. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that fine-tunes multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) as vision-language-action (VLA) policies using online reinforcement learning (RL) with LLM-generated rewards. Our method eliminates the need for large-scale human demonstrations or manually engineered rewards for training such agents. We benchmark against strong zero-shot baselines including GPT-4o as well as supervised fine-tuned MLLMs on our task. Our results show that our RL-finetuned MLLM outperforms all baselines by a significant margin (10.4-16.5%), generalizing well to novel scenes and tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of adapting MLLMs as VLA agents that can act and ask for help using LLM-generated rewards with online RL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Group Critical-token Policy Optimization for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22485v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have extended Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to autoregressive (AR) visual generation and achieved promising progress. However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/zghhui/GCPO</p></details> |

Most recent work improves their performance through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with labeled data or reinforcement learning (RL) from task feedback. In this paper, we study a new perspective: the divergence in solutions generated by LLMs for a single problem. We show that higher solution divergence is positively related to better problem-solving abilities across various models. Based on this finding, we propose solution divergence as a novel metric that can support both SFT and RL strategies. We test this idea on three representative problem domains and find that using solution divergence consistently improves success rates. These results suggest that solution divergence is a simple but effective tool for advancing LLM training and evaluation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 11 figures |

This work introduces NeLLCom-Lex, a neural-agent framework designed to simulate semantic change by first grounding agents in a real lexical system (e.g. English) and then systematically manipulating their communicative needs. Using a well-established color naming task, we simulate the evolution of a lexical system within a single generation, and study which factors lead agents to: (i) develop human-like naming behavior and lexicons, and (ii) change their behavior and lexicons according to their communicative needs. Our experiments with different supervised and reinforcement learning pipelines show that neural agents trained to 'speak' an existing language can reproduce human-like patterns in color naming to a remarkable extent, supporting the further use of NeLLCom-Lex to elucidate the mechanisms of semantic change.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Greenhouse Gas Offset Credit Markets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11258v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Climate change is a major threat to the future of humanity, and its impacts are being intensified by excess man-made greenhouse gas emissions. One method governments can employ to control these emissions is to provide firms with emission limits and penalize any excess emissions above the limit. Excess emissions may also be offset by firms who choose to invest in carbon reducing and capturing projects. These projects generate offset credits which can be submitted to a regulating agency to offset a firm's excess emissions, or they can be traded with other firms. In this work, we characterize the finite-agent Nash equilibrium for offset credit markets. As computing Nash equilibria is an NP-hard problem, we utilize the modern reinforcement learning technique Nash-DQN to efficiently estimate the market's Nash equilibria. We demonstrate not only the validity of employing reinforcement learning methods applied to climate themed financial markets, but also the significant financial savings emitting firms may achieve when abiding by the Nash equilibria through numerical experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Avoiding $\mathbf{exp(R_{max})}$ scaling in RLHF through Preference-based Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00666v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a pivotal technique for large language model (LLM) alignment. This paper studies the setting of online RLHF and focus on improving sample efficiency. All existing algorithms in online RLHF, whether doing passive exploration or active exploration, suffer from a sample complexity that scales exponentially with the scale of the reward function. This fundamental limitation hinders their effectiveness in scenarios with heavily skewed preferences, e.g. questions with a unique correct solution. To address this, we introduce Self-Exploring Preference-Incentive Online Preference Optimization (SE-POPO), an online RLHF algorithm that for the first time achieves a sample complexity that scales polynomially with the reward scale, answering an open problem raised by Xie et al. (2024).. Theoretically, we demonstrate that the sample complexity of SE-POPO dominates that of existing exploration algorithms. Empirically, our systematic evaluation confirms that SE-POPO is more sample-efficient than both exploratory and non-exploratory baselines, in two primary application scenarios of RLHF as well as on public benchmarks, marking a significant step forward in RLHF algorithm design. The code is available at https://github.com/MYC000801/SE-POPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoSketch: A Neural-Symbolic Approach to Geometric Multimodal Reasoning with Auxiliary Line Construction and Affine Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22460v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric Problem Solving (GPS) poses a unique challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), requiring not only the joint interpretation of text and diagrams but also iterative visuospatial reasoning. While existing approaches process diagrams as static images, they lack the capacity for dynamic manipulation - a core aspect of human geometric reasoning involving auxiliary line construction and affine transformations. We present GeoSketch, a neural-symbolic framework that recasts geometric reasoning as an interactive perception-reasoning-action loop. GeoSketch integrates: (1) a Perception module that abstracts diagrams into structured logic forms, (2) a Symbolic Reasoning module that applies geometric theorems to decide the next deductive step, and (3) a Sketch Action module that executes operations such as drawing auxiliary lines or applying transformations, thereby updating the diagram in a closed loop. To train this agent, we develop a two-stage pipeline: supervised fine-tuning on 2,000 symbolic-curated trajectories followed by reinforcement learning with dense, symbolic rewards to enhance robustness and strategic exploration. To evaluate this paradigm, we introduce the GeoSketch Benchmark, a high-quality set of 390 geometry problems requiring auxiliary construction or affine transformations. Experiments on strong MLLM baselines demonstrate that GeoSketch significantly improves stepwise reasoning accuracy and problem-solving success over static perception methods. By unifying hierarchical decision-making, executable visual actions, and symbolic verification, GeoSketch advances multimodal reasoning from static interpretation to dynamic, verifiable interaction, establishing a new foundation for solving complex visuospatial problems.</p></details> |  |

A long-horizon task typically consists of distinct subtasks with well-defined goals, separated by transitional subtasks with unclear goals but critical to the success of the entire task. Existing methods like the mixture of experts and skill chaining struggle with tasks where individual policies do not share significant commonly explored states or lack well-defined initial and terminal states between different phases. In this paper, we introduce a novel policy integration framework to enable the composition of drastically different motor skills in multi-phase long-horizon tasks with ill-defined intermediate states. Based on that, we further introduce a high-level soft router to enable seamless and robust transitions between the subtasks. We evaluate our framework on a set of fundamental basketball skills and challenging transitions. Policies trained by our approach can effectively control the simulated character to interact with the ball and accomplish the long-horizon task specified by real-time user commands, without relying on ball trajectory references.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM T...</summary><p>ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH Asia 2025).

| **[TreeMind: Automatically Reproducing Android Bug Reports via LLM-empowered Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22431v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically reproducing Android app crashes from textual bug reports is challenging, particularly when the reports are incomplete and the modern UI exhibits high combinatorial complexity. Existing approaches based on reinforcement learning or large language models (LLMs) exhibit limitations in such scenarios. They struggle to infer unobserved steps and reconstruct the underlying user action sequences to navigate the vast UI interaction space, primarily due to limited goal-directed reasoning and planning. We present TreeMind, a novel technique that integrates LLMs with a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to achieve strategic UI exploration in bug reproduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to combine external decision-making with LLM semantic reasoning for reliable bug reproduction. We formulate the reproduction task as a target-driven search problem, leveraging MCTS as the core planning mechanism to iteratively refine action sequences. To enhance MCTS with semantic reasoning, we introduce two LLM-guided agents with distinct roles: Expander generates top-k promising actions based on the current UI state and exploration history, while Simulator estimates the likelihood that each action leads toward successful reproduction. By incorporating multi-modal UI inputs and advanced prompting techniques, TreeMind conducts feedback-aware navigation that identifies missing but essential user actions and incrementally reconstructs the reproduction paths. We evaluate TreeMind on a dataset of 93 real-world Android bug reports from three widely-used benchmarks. Experimental results show that it significantly outperforms four state-of-the-art baselines in reproduction success rate. A real-world case study indicates that integrating LLM reasoning with MCTS-based planning is a compelling direction for automated bug reproduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual Reinforcement Learning Synergy in Resource Allocation: Emergence of Self-Organized Momentum Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11161v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In natural ecosystems and human societies, self-organized resource allocation and policy synergy are ubiquitous and significant. This work focuses on the synergy between Dual Reinforcement Learning Policies in the Minority Game (DRLP-MG) to optimize resource allocation. Our study examines a mixed-structured population with two sub-populations: a Q-subpopulation using Q-learning policy and a C-subpopulation adopting the classical policy. We first identify a synergy effect between these subpopulations. A first-order phase transition occurs as the mixing ratio of the subpopulations changes. Further analysis reveals that the Q-subpopulation consists of two internal synergy clusters (IS-clusters) and a single external synergy cluster (ES-cluster). The former contribute to the internal synergy within the Q-subpopulation through synchronization and anti-synchronization, whereas the latter engages in the inter-subpopulation synergy. Within the ES-cluster, the classical momentum strategy in the financial market manifests and assumes a crucial role in the inter-subpopulation synergy. This particular strategy serves to prevent long-term under-utilization of resources. However, it also triggers trend reversals and leads to a decrease in rewards for those who adopt it. Our research reveals that the frozen effect, in either the C- or Q-subpopulation, is a crucial prerequisite for synergy, consistent with previous studies. We also conduct mathematical analyses on subpopulation synergy effects and the synchronization and anti-synchronization forms of IS-clusters in the Q-subpopulation. Overall, our work comprehensively explores the complex resource-allocation dynamics in DRLP-MG, uncovers multiple synergy mechanisms and their conditions, enriching the theoretical understanding of reinforcement-learning-based resource allocation and offering valuable practical insights</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |
| **[ReLAM: Learning Anticipation Model for Rewarding Visual Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22402v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning (RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However, such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound. Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

A Benchmark for Epistemic Competence in Information-Seeking Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22391v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has explored training Large Language Model (LLM) search agents with reinforcement learning (RL) for open-domain question answering (QA). However, most evaluations focus solely on final answer accuracy, overlooking how these agents reason with and act on external evidence. We introduce SeekBench, the first benchmark for evaluating the \textit{epistemic competence} of LLM search agents through step-level analysis of their response traces. SeekBench comprises 190 expert-annotated traces with over 1,800 response steps generated by LLM search agents, each enriched with evidence annotations for granular analysis of whether agents (1) generate reasoning steps grounded in observed evidence, (2) adaptively reformulate searches to recover from low-quality results, and (3) have proper calibration to correctly assess whether the current evidence is sufficient for providing an answer.</p></details> |  |

While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bézier Meets Diffusion: Robust Generation Across Domains for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22476v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training robust learning algorithms across different medical imaging modalities is challenging due to the large domain gap. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains. Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation performance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |

These challenges primarily stem from two key limitations of conventional U-Net architectures: (1) their simple skip connections ignore the encoder-decoder semantic gap between various features, and (2) they lack the capability for multi-scale feature extraction in deep layers. To address these challenges, we propose the U-Net with Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (U-MAN), a novel architecture that enhances the emerging Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) with two specialized modules: Progressive Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (PAGF) and the Multi-scale Adaptive KAN (MAN). Our PAGF module replaces the simple skip connection, using attention to fuse features from the encoder and decoder. The MAN module enables the network to adaptively process features at multiple scales, improving its ability to segment objects of various sizes. Experiments on three public datasets (BUSI, GLAS, and CVC) show that U-MAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, particularly in defining accurate boundaries and preserving fine details.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma Guided Network for Efficient 3D Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22307v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lightweight 3D medical image segmentation remains constrained by a fundamental "efficiency / robustness conflict", particularly when processing complex anatomical structures and heterogeneous modalities. In this paper, we study how to redesign the framework based on the characteristics of high-dimensional 3D images, and explore data synergy to overcome the fragile representation of lightweight methods. Our approach, VeloxSeg, begins with a deployable and extensible dual-stream CNN-Transformer architecture composed of Paired Window Attention (PWA) and Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma-guided convolution (JLC). For each 3D image, we invoke a "glance-and-focus" principle, where PWA rapidly retrieves multi-scale information, and JLC ensures robust local feature extraction with minimal parameters, significantly enhancing the model's ability to operate with low computational budget. Followed by an extension of the dual-stream architecture that incorporates modal interaction into the multi-scale image-retrieval process, VeloxSeg efficiently models heterogeneous modalities. Finally, Spatially Decoupled Knowledge Transfer (SDKT) via Gram matrices injects the texture prior extracted by a self-supervised network into the segmentation network, yielding stronger representations than baselines at no extra inference cost. Experimental results on multimodal benchmarks show that VeloxSeg achieves a 26% Dice improvement, alongside increasing GPU throughput by 11x and CPU by 48x.

| **[COMPASS: Robust Feature Conformal Prediction for Medical Segmentation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22240v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical applications, the utility of segmentation models is often based on the accuracy of derived downstream metrics such as organ size, rather than by the pixel-level accuracy of the segmentation masks themselves. Thus, uncertainty quantification for such metrics is crucial for decision-making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a popular framework to derive such principled uncertainty guarantees, but applying CP naively to the final scalar metric is inefficient because it treats the complex, non-linear segmentation-to-metric pipeline as a black box. We introduce COMPASS, a practical framework that generates efficient, metric-based CP intervals for image segmentation models by leveraging the inductive biases of their underlying deep neural networks. COMPASS performs calibration directly in the model's representation space by perturbing intermediate features along low-dimensional subspaces maximally sensitive to the target metric. We prove that COMPASS achieves valid marginal coverage under exchangeability and nestedness assumptions. Empirically, we demonstrate that COMPASS produces significantly tighter intervals than traditional CP baselines on four medical image segmentation tasks for area estimation of skin lesions and anatomical structures. Furthermore, we show that leveraging learned internal features to estimate importance weights allows COMPASS to also recover target coverage under covariate shifts. COMPASS paves the way for practical, metric-based uncertainty quantification for medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiPerformer: A High-Performance Global-Local Segmentation Model with Modular Hierarchical Fusion Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20280v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information. The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods. Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/xzphappy/HiPerformer.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching 78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Stratify or Die: Rethinking Data Splits in Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21056v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random splitting of datasets in image segmentation often leads to unrepresentative test sets, resulting in biased evaluations and poor model generalization. While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward, label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging, and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation.

While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs. We evaluate CONSIGN against two CP baselines across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, they remain underexploited since the superpixel decomposition may produce irregular and non stable segmentation results due to the dependency to the image content. In this paper, we first introduce a novel structure, a superpixel-based patch, called SuperPatch. The proposed structure, based on superpixel neighborhood, leads to a robust descriptor since spatial information is naturally included. The generalization of the PatchMatch method to SuperPatches, named SuperPatchMatch, is introduced. Finally, we propose a framework to perform fast segmentation and labeling from an image database, and demonstrate the potential of our approach since we outperform, in terms of computational cost and accuracy, the results of state-of-the-art methods on both face labeling and medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 2017 Selected for presentation at IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2017</p></details> |
| **[SwinMamba: A hybrid local-global mamba framework for enhancing semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20918v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of remote sensing imagery is a fundamental task in computer vision, supporting a wide range of applications such as land use classification, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, this task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts. To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details, while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding 3D Positions of Distant Objects from Noisy Camera Movement and Semantic Segmentation Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20906v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing, addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However, conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG. Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |
| **[RIS-LAD: A Benchmark and Model for Referring Low-Altitude Drone Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20920v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS), which aims to segment specific objects based on natural language descriptions, plays an essential role in vision-language understanding. Despite its progress in remote sensing applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored. Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small, cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at: https://github.com/AHideoKuzeA/RIS-LAD/.</p></details> |  |

A computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |
| **[Boosting LiDAR-Based Localization with Semantic Insight: Camera Projection versus Direct LiDAR Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20486v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges, particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations. However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline. For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK). Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas, multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Shortest Path-based Superpixels for 3D Spherical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19895v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide 360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space, addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure. Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based applications on 360o images.</p></details> |  |
| **[nnFilterMatch: A Unified Semi-Supervised Learning Framework with Uncertainty-Aware Pseudo-Label Filtering for Efficient Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19746v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a promising paradigm in medical image segmentation, offering competitive performance while substantially reducing the need for extensive manual annotation. When combined with active learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data. This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction (LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information. Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust In-Context Learning for Medical Image Segmentation via Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19711v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity. While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets, generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the generated dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Neuroverse3D.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present a framework that leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline. Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 20th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization</p></details> |

Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels, while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively. Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with 4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such as point-of-care devices.

In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> |

Reverse Classification Accuracy (RCA) is an approach that estimates the quality of new predictions on unseen samples by training a segmenter on those predictions, and then evaluating it against existing annotated images. In this work, we introduce Conformal In-Context RCA, a novel method for automatically estimating segmentation quality with statistical guarantees in the absence of ground-truth annotations, which consists of two main innovations. First, In-Context RCA, which leverages recent in-context learning models for image segmentation and incorporates retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images. This approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data while avoiding the need of training additional models. Second, we introduce Conformal RCA, which extends both the original RCA framework and In-Context RCA to go beyond point estimation. Using tools from split conformal prediction, Conformal RCA produces prediction intervals for segmentation quality providing statistical guarantees that the true score lies within the estimated interval with a user-specified probability. Validated across 10 different medical imaging tasks in various organs and modalities, our methods demonstrate robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential.

| **[A Semantic Segmentation Algorithm for Pleural Effusion Based on DBIF-AUNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06191v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness. Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

| **[Group Evidence Matters: Tiling-based Semantic Gating for Dense Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10779v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense small objects in UAV imagery are often missed due to long-range viewpoints, occlusion, and clutter[cite: 5]. This paper presents a detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids) and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to 0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects, spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[OS-W2S: An Automatic Labeling Engine for Language-Guided Open-Set Aerial Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03334v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, language-guided open-set aerial object detection has gained significant attention due to its better alignment with real-world application needs. However, due to limited datasets, most existing language-guided methods primarily focus on vocabulary-level descriptions, which fail to meet the demands of fine-grained open-world detection. To address this limitation, we propose constructing a large-scale language-guided open-set aerial detection dataset, encompassing three levels of language guidance: from words to phrases, and ultimately to sentences. Centered around an open-source large vision-language model and integrating image-operation-based preprocessing with BERT-based postprocessing, we present the OS-W2S Label Engine, an automatic annotation pipeline capable of handling diverse scene annotations for aerial images. Using this label engine, we expand existing aerial detection datasets with rich textual annotations and construct a novel benchmark dataset, called MI-OAD, addressing the limitations of current remote sensing grounding data and enabling effective language-guided open-set aerial detection. Specifically, MI-OAD contains 163,023 images and 2 million image-caption pairs, approximately 40 times larger than comparable datasets. To demonstrate the effectiveness and quality of MI-OAD, we evaluate three representative tasks. On language-guided open-set aerial detection, training on MI-OAD lifts Grounding DINO by +31.1 AP$_{50}$ and +34.7 Recall@10 with sentence-level inputs under zero-shot transfer. Moreover, using MI-OAD for pre-training yields state-of-the-art performance on multiple existing open-vocabulary aerial detection and remote sensing visual grounding benchmarks, validating both the effectiveness of the dataset and the high quality of its OS-W2S annotations.

| **[SSVIF: Self-Supervised Segmentation-Oriented Visible and Infrared Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22450v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide application in tasks such as scene segmentation and object detection. VIF methods can be broadly classified into traditional VIF methods and application-oriented VIF methods. Traditional methods focus solely on improving the quality of fused images, while application-oriented VIF methods additionally consider the performance of downstream tasks on fused images by introducing task-specific loss terms during training. However, compared to traditional methods, application-oriented VIF methods require datasets labeled for downstream tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation or object detection), making data acquisition labor-intensive and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised training framework for segmentation-oriented VIF methods (SSVIF). Leveraging the consistency between feature-level fusion-based segmentation and pixel-level fusion-based segmentation, we introduce a novel self-supervised task-cross-segmentation consistency-that enables the fusion model to learn high-level semantic features without the supervision of segmentation labels. Additionally, we design a two-stage training strategy and a dynamic weight adjustment method for effective joint learning within our self-supervised framework. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SSVIF. Remarkably, although trained only on unlabeled visible-infrared image pairs, our SSVIF outperforms traditional VIF methods and rivals supervised segmentation-oriented ones. Our code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

In computer vision, for instance, RGB images processed through image signal processing (ISP) pipelines designed to cater to human perception are the most frequent input to image analysis networks. However, many modern vision tasks operate without a human in the loop, raising the question of whether such pre-processing is optimal for automated analysis. Similarly, human activity recognition (HAR) on body-worn sensor data commonly takes normalized floating-point data arising from a high-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) as an input, despite such an approach being highly inefficient in terms of data transmission, significantly affecting the battery life of wearable devices. In this work, we target low-bandwidth and energy-constrained settings where sensors are limited to low-bit-depth capture. We propose $\gamma$-Quant, i.e.~the task-specific learning of a non-linear quantization for pattern recognition. We exemplify our approach on raw-image object detection as well as HAR of wearable data, and demonstrate that raw data with a learnable quantization using as few as 4-bits can perform on par with the use of raw 12-bit data. All code to reproduce our experiments is publicly available via https://github.com/Mishalfatima/Gamma-Quant</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DAGM GCPR 2025</p></details> |

While YOLO-series detectors have achieved remarkable success in real-time large object detection, they suffer from significantly higher false negative rates for drone-based detection where small objects dominate, compared to large object scenarios. This paper proposes HierLight-YOLO, a hierarchical feature fusion and lightweight model that enhances the real-time detection of small objects, based on the YOLOv8 architecture. We propose the Hierarchical Extended Path Aggregation Network (HEPAN), a multi-scale feature fusion method through hierarchical cross-level connections, enhancing the small object detection accuracy. HierLight-YOLO includes two innovative lightweight modules: Inverted Residual Depthwise Convolution Block (IRDCB) and Lightweight Downsample (LDown) module, which significantly reduce the model's parameters and computational complexity without sacrificing detection capabilities. Small object detection head is designed to further enhance spatial resolution and feature fusion to tackle the tiny object (4 pixels) detection. Comparison experiments and ablation studies on the VisDrone2019 benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance of HierLight-YOLO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rate-Distortion Optimized Communication for Collaborative Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21994v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collaborative perception emphasizes enhancing environmental understanding by enabling multiple agents to share visual information with limited bandwidth resources. While prior work has explored the empirical trade-off between task performance and communication volume, a significant gap remains in the theoretical foundation. To fill this gap, we draw on information theory and introduce a pragmatic rate-distortion theory for multi-agent collaboration, specifically formulated to analyze performance-communication trade-off in goal-oriented multi-agent systems. This theory concretizes two key conditions for designing optimal communication strategies: supplying pragmatically relevant information and transmitting redundancy-less messages. Guided by these two conditions, we propose RDcomm, a communication-efficient collaborative perception framework that introduces two key innovations: i) task entropy discrete coding, which assigns features with task-relevant codeword-lengths to maximize the efficiency in supplying pragmatic information; ii) mutual-information-driven message selection, which utilizes mutual information neural estimation to approach the optimal redundancy-less condition. Experiments on 3D object detection and BEV segmentation demonstrate that RDcomm achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on DAIR-V2X and OPV2V, while reducing communication volume by up to 108 times. The code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable Conformal Prediction with Context-Aware Nonconformity Functions for Robotic Planning and Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21955v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models in robotics often output point estimates with poorly calibrated confidences, offering no native mechanism to quantify predictive reliability under novel, noisy, or out-of-distribution inputs. Conformal prediction (CP) addresses this gap by providing distribution-free coverage guarantees, yet its reliance on fixed nonconformity scores ignores context and can yield intervals that are overly conservative or unsafe. We address this with Learnable Conformal Prediction (LCP), which replaces fixed scores with a lightweight neural function that leverages geometric, semantic, and task-specific features to produce context-aware uncertainty sets. LCP maintains CP's theoretical guarantees while reducing prediction set sizes by 18% in classification, tightening detection intervals by 52%, and improving path planning safety from 72% to 91% success with minimal overhead. Across three robotic tasks on seven benchmarks, LCP consistently outperforms Standard CP and ensemble baselines. In classification on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, it achieves smaller set sizes (4.7-9.9% reduction) at target coverage. For object detection on COCO, BDD100K, and Cityscapes, it produces 46-54% tighter bounding boxes. In path planning through cluttered environments, it improves success to 91.5% with only 4.5% path inflation, compared to 12.2% for Standard CP. The method is lightweight (approximately 4.8% runtime overhead, 42 KB memory) and supports online adaptation, making it well suited to resource-constrained autonomous systems. Hardware evaluation shows LCP adds less than 1% memory and 15.9% inference overhead, yet sustains 39 FPS on detection tasks while being 7.4 times more energy-efficient than ensembles.</p></details> |  |
| **[PANICL: Mitigating Over-Reliance on Single Prompt in Visual In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21926v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) uses input-output image pairs, referred to as in-context pairs (or examples), as prompts alongside query images to guide models in performing diverse vision tasks. However, VICL often suffers from over-reliance on a single in-context pair, which can lead to biased and unstable predictions. We introduce PAtch-based $k$-Nearest neighbor visual In-Context Learning (PANICL), a general training-free framework that mitigates this issue by leveraging multiple in-context pairs. PANICL smooths assignment scores across pairs, reducing bias without requiring additional training. Extensive experiments on a variety of tasks, including foreground segmentation, single object detection, colorization, multi-object segmentation, and keypoint detection, demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Moreover, PANICL exhibits strong robustness to domain shifts, including dataset-level shift (e.g., from COCO to Pascal) and label-space shift (e.g., FSS-1000), and generalizes well to other VICL models such as SegGPT, Painter, and LVM, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

To address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings. The code is available at https://github.com/gy65896/Neptune-X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Object Detection Meets DINOv3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20787v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features, resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets. Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model (9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer parameters.

However, challenges such as class imbalance, thermal noise, and computational constraints can significantly hinder model performance in practical settings. To address these issues, we evaluate multiple YOLO variants on the FLIR ADAS V2 dataset, ultimately selecting YOLOv8 as our baseline due to its balanced accuracy and efficiency. Building on this foundation, we present \texttt{MS-YOLO} (\textbf{M}obileNetv4 and \textbf{S}lideLoss based on YOLO), which replaces YOLOv8's CSPDarknet backbone with the more efficient MobileNetV4, reducing computational overhead by \textbf{1.5%} while sustaining high accuracy. In addition, we introduce \emph{SlideLoss}, a novel loss function that dynamically emphasizes under-represented and occluded samples, boosting precision without sacrificing recall. Experiments on the FLIR ADAS V2 benchmark show that \texttt{MS-YOLO} attains competitive mAP and superior precision while operating at only \textbf{6.7 GFLOPs}. These results demonstrate that \texttt{MS-YOLO} effectively addresses the dual challenge of maintaining high detection quality while minimizing computational costs, making it well-suited for real-time edge deployment in urban environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2025.

| **[SOOD++: Leveraging Unlabeled Data to Boost Oriented Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01016v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), leveraging unlabeled data to boost object detectors, has become a hot topic recently. However, existing SSOD approaches mainly focus on horizontal objects, leaving oriented objects common in aerial images unexplored. At the same time, the annotation cost of oriented objects is significantly higher than that of their horizontal counterparts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Semi-supervised Oriented Object Detection method termed SOOD++. Specifically, we observe that objects from aerial images usually have arbitrary orientations, small scales, and dense distribution, which inspires the following core designs: a Simple Instance-aware Dense Sampling (SIDS) strategy is used to generate comprehensive dense pseudo-labels; the Geometry-aware Adaptive Weighting (GAW) loss dynamically modulates the importance of each pair between pseudo-label and corresponding prediction by leveraging the intricate geometric information of aerial objects; we treat aerial images as global layouts and explicitly build the many-to-many relationship between the sets of pseudo-labels and predictions via the proposed Noise-driven Global Consistency (NGC). Extensive experiments conducted on various oriented object datasets under various labeled settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on the DOTA-V2.0/DOTA-V1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin (+2.90/2.14, +2.16/2.18, and +2.66/2.32) mAP under 10%, 20%, and 30% labeled data settings, respectively, with single-scale training and testing. More importantly, it still improves upon a strong supervised baseline with 70.66 mAP, trained using the full DOTA-V1.5 train-val set, by +1.82 mAP, resulting in a 72.48 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art.

| **[Task-Oriented Computation Offloading for Edge Inference: An Integrated Bayesian Optimization and Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21090v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Edge intelligence (EI) allows resource-constrained edge devices (EDs) to offload computation-intensive AI tasks (e.g., visual object detection) to edge servers (ESs) for fast execution. However, transmitting high-volume raw task data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p), it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships. Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity. Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b) a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and 0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Modular Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10787v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) extends recognition beyond fixed taxonomies by aligning visual and textual features, as in MDETR, GLIP, or RegionCLIP. While effective, these models require updating all parameters of large vision--language backbones, leading to prohibitive training cost. Recent efficient OVD approaches, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or adapters, reduce trainable parameters but often face challenges in selecting which layers to adapt and in balancing efficiency with accuracy. We propose UniProj-Det, a lightweight modular framework for parameter-efficient OVD. UniProj-Det freezes pretrained backbones and introduces a Universal Projection module with a learnable modality token, enabling unified vision--language adaptation at minimal cost. Applied to MDETR, our framework trains only about ~2-5% of parameters while achieving competitive or superior performance on phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and segmentation. Comprehensive analysis of FLOPs, memory, latency, and ablations demonstrates UniProj-Det as a principled step toward scalable and efficient open-vocabulary detection.</p></details> |  |

Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes, outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods, SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP, achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.</p></details> |  |

In that scenario, adversarial patch attacks on an onboard object detector can severely impair the performance of upstream tasks. This paper proposes a novel model-agnostic defense mechanism against the threat of adversarial patch attacks in the context of UAV-based object detection. We formulate adversarial patch defense as an occlusion removal task. The proposed defense method can neutralize adversarial patches located on objects of interest, without exposure to adversarial patches during training. Our lightweight single-stage defense approach allows us to maintain a model-agnostic nature, that once deployed does not require to be updated in response to changes in the object detection pipeline. The evaluations in digital and physical domains show the feasibility of our method for deployment in UAV object detection pipelines, by significantly decreasing the Attack Success Ratio without incurring significant processing costs. As a result, the proposed defense solution can improve the reliability of object detection for UAVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IROS 2024</p></details> |

| **[Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02876v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding focuses on detecting objects from images based on language expressions. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced visual grounding performance by training large models with large-scale datasets. However, the problem remains challenging, especially when similar objects appear in the input image. For example, an LVLM may not be able to differentiate Diet Coke and regular Coke in an image. In this case, if additional reference images of Diet Coke and regular Coke are available, it can help the visual grounding of similar objects. In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding (MRVG). In this task, a model has access to a set of reference images of objects in a database. Based on these reference images and a language expression, the model is required to detect a target object from a query image. We first introduce a new dataset to study the MRVG problem. Then we introduce a novel method, named MRVG-Net, to solve this visual grounding problem. We show that by efficiently using reference images with few-shot object detection and using Large Language Models (LLMs) for object matching, our method achieves superior visual grounding performance compared to the state-of-the-art LVLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B.

This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving.

The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors.

Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.724 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.</p></details> | Camera-ready copy |

Active learning (AL) has emerged as a promising solution to minimize annotation costs by selecting the most informative samples. While traditional AL approaches primarily rely on uncertainty-based selection, recent advances suggest that incorporating diversity-based strategies can enhance sampling efficiency in object detection tasks. Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models.

However, detecting Shatian pomelo in complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection. SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations, thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment, we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of 0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation for the further development of automatic harvest robots.</p></details> |  |

Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU. The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability. The code will be released at https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack.</p></details> | IJCAI version |

Recent DETR-based frameworks offer end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6 mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastTracker: Real-Time and Accurate Visual Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14370v5)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional multi-object tracking (MOT) systems are predominantly designed for pedestrian tracking and often exhibit limited generalization to other object categories. This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

| **[An Analysis of Kalman Filter based Object Tracking Methods for Fast-Moving Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18451v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18272v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSEv2: A More Challenging Dataset for Video Object Segmentation in Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05630v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the foundations and insights of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces much greater scene complexity, including {more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and scenarios requiring external knowledge.} We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops on MOSEv2. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and observe similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 poses challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite strong performance on existing datasets, current VOS methods still fall short under real-world complexities. Based on our analysis of the observed challenges, we further propose several practical tricks that enhance model performance.

Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines.

LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF.

This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |

Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on Github: https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM</p></details> |

The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page Journal paper, accepted by IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy</p></details> |
| **[T-SiamTPN: Temporal Siamese Transformer Pyramid Networks for Robust and Efficient UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12913v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations, dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Seg2Track-SAM2: SAM2-based Multi-object Tracking and Segmentation for Zero-shot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11772v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

| **[Motion Estimation for Multi-Object Tracking using KalmanNet with Semantic-Independent Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11323v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT). It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters. The code is available at (https://github.com/SongJgit/filternet and https://github.com/SongJgit/TBDTracker).</p></details> |  |
| **[ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

| **[An HMM-based framework for identity-aware long-term multi-object tracking from sparse and uncertain identification: use case on long-term tracking in livestock](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09962v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes. Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted at CVPR animal workshop 2024, submitted to IJCV</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.</p></details> |  |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments.

While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.</p></details> |  |

Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.</p></details> |  |

| **[Language Models Can Learn from Verbal Feedback Without Scalar Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22638v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are often trained with RL from human or AI feedback, yet such methods typically compress nuanced feedback into scalar rewards, discarding much of their richness and inducing scale imbalance. We propose treating verbal feedback as a conditioning signal. Inspired by language priors in text-to-image generation, which enable novel outputs from unseen prompts, we introduce the feedback-conditional policy (FCP). FCP learns directly from response-feedback pairs, approximating the feedback-conditional posterior through maximum likelihood training on offline data. We further develop an online bootstrapping stage where the policy generates under positive conditions and receives fresh feedback to refine itself. This reframes feedback-driven learning as conditional generation rather than reward optimization, offering a more expressive way for LLMs to directly learn from verbal feedback. Our code is available at https://github.com/sail-sg/feedback-conditional-policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transport Based Mean Flows for Generative Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22592v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation, and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniMIC: Token-Based Multimodal Interactive Coding for Human-AI Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22570v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) and cloud-based AI agents is transforming human-AI collaboration into bidirectional, multimodal interaction. However, existing codecs remain optimized for unimodal, one-way communication, resulting in repeated degradation under conventional compress-transmit-reconstruct pipelines. To address this limitation, we propose UniMIC, a Unified token-based Multimodal Interactive Coding framework that bridges edge devices and cloud AI agents. Instead of transmitting raw pixels or plain text, UniMIC employs compact tokenized representations as the communication medium, enabling efficient low-bitrate transmission while maintaining compatibility with LMMs. To further enhance compression, lightweight Transformer-based entropy models with scenario-specific designs-generic, masked, and text-conditioned-effectively minimize inter-token redundancy. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation, text-guided inpainting, outpainting, and visual question answering show that UniMIC achieves substantial bitrate savings and remains robust even at ultra-low bitrates (<0.05bpp), without compromising downstream task performance. These results establish UniMIC as a practical and forward-looking paradigm for next-generation multimodal interactive communication.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent advancements, existing methods often fail to meet key requirements for 3D reconstruction and view synthesis, including geometric consistency, fine details, robustness to real-world challenges like reflective surfaces, and efficiency for edge devices. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel MDE system, called EfficientDepth, which combines a transformer architecture with a lightweight convolutional decoder, as well as a bimodal density head that allows the network to estimate detailed depth maps. We train our model on a combination of labeled synthetic and real images, as well as pseudo-labeled real images, generated using a high-performing MDE method. Furthermore, we employ a multi-stage optimization strategy to improve training efficiency and produce models that emphasize geometric consistency and fine detail. Finally, in addition to commonly used objectives, we introduce a loss function based on LPIPS to encourage the network to produce detailed depth maps. Experimental results demonstrate that EfficientDepth achieves performance comparable to or better than existing state-of-the-art models, with significantly reduced computational resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, existing methods typically apply uniform optimization across all image tokens, while the varying contributions of different image tokens for RLVR's training remain unexplored. In fact, the key obstacle lies in how to identify more critical image tokens during AR generation and implement effective token-wise optimization for them. To tackle this challenge, we propose $\textbf{G}$roup $\textbf{C}$ritical-token $\textbf{P}$olicy $\textbf{O}$ptimization ($\textbf{GCPO}$), which facilitates effective policy optimization on critical tokens. We identify the critical tokens in RLVR-based AR generation from three perspectives, specifically: $\textbf{(1)}$ Causal dependency: early tokens fundamentally determine the later tokens and final image effect due to unidirectional dependency; $\textbf{(2)}$ Entropy-induced spatial structure: tokens with high entropy gradients correspond to image structure and bridges distinct visual regions; $\textbf{(3)}$ RLVR-focused token diversity: tokens with low visual similarity across a group of sampled images contribute to richer token-level diversity. For these identified critical tokens, we further introduce a dynamic token-wise advantage weight to encourage exploration, based on confidence divergence between the policy model and reference model. By leveraging 30\% of the image tokens, GCPO achieves better performance than GRPO with full tokens. Extensive experiments on multiple text-to-image benchmarks for both AR models and unified multimodal models demonstrate the effectiveness of GCPO for AR visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/zghhui/GCPO</p></details> |

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) mitigates this problem by using annotated images from the source domain and unlabeled images from the target domain to train the deep models. Existing approaches often rely on GAN-based style transfer, but these methods struggle to capture cross-domain mappings in regions with high variability. In this paper, we propose a unified framework, B\'ezier Meets Diffusion, for cross-domain image generation. First, we introduce a B\'ezier-curve-based style transfer strategy that effectively reduces the domain gap between source and target domains. The transferred source images enable the training of a more robust segmentation model across domains. Thereafter, using pseudo-labels generated by this segmentation model on the target domain, we train a conditional diffusion model (CDM) to synthesize high-quality, labeled target-domain images. To mitigate the impact of noisy pseudo-labels, we further develop an uncertainty-guided score matching method that improves the robustness of CDM training. Extensive experiments on public datasets demonstrate that our approach generates realistic labeled images, significantly augmenting the target domain and improving segmentation performance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Closing the Safety Gap: Surgical Concept Erasure in Visual Autoregressive Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22400v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of visual autoregressive (VAR) models has brought new opportunities for text-to-image generation, but also heightened safety concerns. Existing concept erasure techniques, primarily designed for diffusion models, fail to generalize to VARs due to their next-scale token prediction paradigm. In this paper, we first propose a novel VAR Erasure framework VARE that enables stable concept erasure in VAR models by leveraging auxiliary visual tokens to reduce fine-tuning intensity. Building upon this, we introduce S-VARE, a novel and effective concept erasure method designed for VAR, which incorporates a filtered cross entropy loss to precisely identify and minimally adjust unsafe visual tokens, along with a preservation loss to maintain semantic fidelity, addressing the issues such as language drift and reduced diversity introduce by na\"ive fine-tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves surgical concept erasure while preserving generation quality, thereby closing the safety gap in autoregressive text-to-image generation by earlier methods.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods struggle to preserve sharp focus-defocus boundaries, often resulting in blurred transitions and focused details loss. To solve this problem, we propose a MFIF method based on significant boundary enhancement, which generates high-quality fused boundaries while effectively detecting focus in-formation. Particularly, we propose a gradient-domain-based model that can obtain initial fusion results with complete boundaries and effectively pre-serve the boundary details. Additionally, we introduce Tenengrad gradient detection to extract salient features from both the source images and the ini-tial fused image, generating the corresponding saliency maps. For boundary refinement, we develop a focus metric based on gradient and complementary information, integrating the salient features with the complementary infor-mation across images to emphasize focused regions and produce a high-quality initial decision result. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms 12 state-of-the-art methods in both subjective and objective evaluations.

To address this issue, we propose a novel momentum-based sampling technique, termed history-guided sampling (HiGS), which enhances quality and efficiency of diffusion sampling by integrating recent model predictions into each inference step. Specifically, HiGS leverages the difference between the current prediction and a weighted average of past predictions to steer the sampling process toward more realistic outputs with better details and structure. Our approach introduces practically no additional computation and integrates seamlessly into existing diffusion frameworks, requiring neither extra training nor fine-tuning. Extensive experiments show that HiGS consistently improves image quality across diverse models and architectures and under varying sampling budgets and guidance scales. Moreover, using a pretrained SiT model, HiGS achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.61 for unguided ImageNet generation at 256$\times$256 with only 30 sampling steps (instead of the standard 250). We thus present HiGS as a plug-and-play enhancement to standard diffusion sampling that enables faster generation with higher fidelity.</p></details> |  |

Style-GAN provides a structured latent space, DragGAN enables intuitive image manipulation, and PCA reduces dimensionality and facilitates cross-model alignment for more streamlined and interpretable exploration of latent spaces. We apply our techniques to the Animal Faces High Quality (AFHQ) dataset, and find that our approach of integrating PCA-based dimensionality reduction with the Drag-GAN framework for image manipulation retains performance while improving optimization efficiency. Notably, introducing PCA into the latent W+ layers of DragGAN can consistently reduce the total optimization time while maintaining good visual quality and even boosting the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of the optimized image, particularly in shallower latent spaces (W+ layers = 3). We also demonstrate capability for aligning images generated by two StyleGAN models trained on similar but distinct data domains (AFHQ-Dog and AFHQ-Cat), and show that we can control the latent space of these aligned images to manipulate the images in an intuitive and interpretable manner. Our findings highlight the possibility for efficient and interpretable latent space control for a wide range of image synthesis and editing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages with 7 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |

However, the high resource demands of these models and the scarcity of well-annotated data have hindered their deployment on edge devices, leading to enormous costs and privacy concerns, especially when user data is sent to a third party. To overcome these challenges, we propose Refine-Control, a semi-supervised distillation framework. Specifically, we improve the performance of the student model by introducing a tri-level knowledge fusion loss to transfer different levels of knowledge. To enhance generalization and alleviate dataset scarcity, we introduce a semi-supervised distillation method utilizing both labeled and unlabeled data. Our experiments reveal that Refine-Control achieves significant reductions in computational cost and latency, while maintaining high-fidelity generation capabilities and controllability, as quantified by comparative metrics.</p></details> | 5 pages,17 figures |

In particular, adversarial evasion considers scenarios where adversaries adapt their data to influence particular outcomes from established prediction models, such scenarios arise in applications such as spam email filtering, malware detection and fake-image generation, where security methods must be actively updated to keep up with the ever-improving generation of malicious data. Game theoretic models have been shown to be effective at modelling these scenarios and hence training resilient predictors against such adversaries. Recent advancements in the use of pessimistic bilevel optimsiation which remove assumptions about the convexity and uniqueness of the adversary's optimal strategy have proved to be particularly effective at mitigating threats to classifiers due to its ability to capture the antagonistic nature of the adversary. However, this formulation has not yet been adapted to regression scenarios. This article serves to propose a pessimistic bilevel optimisation program for regression scenarios which makes no assumptions on the convexity or uniqueness of the adversary's solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[DynamicControl: Adaptive Condition Selection for Improved Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03255v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To enhance the controllability of text-to-image diffusion models, current ControlNet-like models have explored various control signals to dictate image attributes. However, existing methods either handle conditions inefficiently or use a fixed number of conditions, which does not fully address the complexity of multiple conditions and their potential conflicts. This underscores the need for innovative approaches to manage multiple conditions effectively for more reliable and detailed image synthesis. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework, DynamicControl, which supports dynamic combinations of diverse control signals, allowing adaptive selection of different numbers and types of conditions. Our approach begins with a double-cycle controller that generates an initial real score sorting for all input conditions by leveraging pre-trained conditional generation models and discriminative models. This controller evaluates the similarity between extracted conditions and input conditions, as well as the pixel-level similarity with the source image. Then, we integrate a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to build an efficient condition evaluator. This evaluator optimizes the ordering of conditions based on the double-cycle controller's score ranking. Our method jointly optimizes MLLMs and diffusion models, utilizing MLLMs' reasoning capabilities to facilitate multi-condition text-to-image (T2I) tasks. The final sorted conditions are fed into a parallel multi-control adapter, which learns feature maps from dynamic visual conditions and integrates them to modulate ControlNet, thereby enhancing control over generated images. Through both quantitative and qualitative comparisons, DynamicControl demonstrates its superiority over existing methods in terms of controllability, generation quality and composability under various conditional controls.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mind-the-Glitch: Visual Correspondence for Detecting Inconsistencies in Subject-Driven Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21989v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach for disentangling visual and semantic features from the backbones of pre-trained diffusion models, enabling visual correspondence in a manner analogous to the well-established semantic correspondence. While diffusion model backbones are known to encode semantically rich features, they must also contain visual features to support their image synthesis capabilities. However, isolating these visual features is challenging due to the absence of annotated datasets. To address this, we introduce an automated pipeline that constructs image pairs with annotated semantic and visual correspondences based on existing subject-driven image generation datasets, and design a contrastive architecture to separate the two feature types. Leveraging the disentangled representations, we propose a new metric, Visual Semantic Matching (VSM), that quantifies visual inconsistencies in subject-driven image generation. Empirical results show that our approach outperforms global feature-based metrics such as CLIP, DINO, and vision--language models in quantifying visual inconsistencies while also enabling spatial localization of inconsistent regions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that supports both quantification and localization of inconsistencies in subject-driven generation, offering a valuable tool for advancing this task.

However, existing methods, particularly those built on the In-Context-Learning paradigm, are limited by their reliance on simple reconstruction-based objectives, leading to both severe attribute leakage that compromises subject fidelity and failing to align with nuanced human preferences. To address this, we propose MultiCrafter, a framework that ensures high-fidelity, preference-aligned generation. First, we find that the root cause of attribute leakage is a significant entanglement of attention between different subjects during the generation process. Therefore, we introduce explicit positional supervision to explicitly separate attention regions for each subject, effectively mitigating attribute leakage. To enable the model to accurately plan the attention region of different subjects in diverse scenarios, we employ a Mixture-of-Experts architecture to enhance the model's capacity, allowing different experts to focus on different scenarios. Finally, we design a novel online reinforcement learning framework to align the model with human preferences, featuring a scoring mechanism to accurately assess multi-subject fidelity and a more stable training strategy tailored for the MoE architecture. Experiments validate that our framework significantly improves subject fidelity while aligning with human preferences better.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://wutao-cs.github.io/MultiCrafter/</p></details> |
| **[Discrete Guidance Matching: Exact Guidance for Discrete Flow Matching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21912v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However, such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model, leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding tasks.

| **[TempFlow-GRPO: When Timing Matters for GRPO in Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04324v3)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The machine learning community has been engaging this problem with an extensive series of publications proposing algorithmic solutions for the detection of "fake", e.g. entirely generated or partially manipulated images. While there is undoubtedly some progress towards technical solutions of the problem, we argue that current and prior work is focusing too much on generative algorithms and "fake" data-samples, neglecting a clear definition and data collection of "real" images. The fundamental question "what is a real image?" might appear to be quite philosophical, but our analysis shows that the development and evaluation of basically all current "fake"-detection methods is relying on only a few, quite old low-resolution datasets of "real" images like ImageNet. However, the technology for the acquisition of "real" images, aka taking photos, has drastically evolved over the last decade: Today, over 90% of all photographs are produced by smartphones which typically use algorithms to compute an image from multiple inputs (over time) from multiple sensors. Based on the fact that these image formation algorithms are typically neural network architectures which are closely related to "fake"-image generators, we state the position that today, we need to re-think the concept of "real" images. The purpose of this position paper is to raise the awareness of the current shortcomings in this active field of research and to trigger an open discussion whether the detection of "fake" images is a sound objective at all. At the very least, we need a clear technical definition of "real" images and new benchmark datasets.</p></details> |  |

Through detailed exploration, we offer a suite of ready-to-use solutions, ranging from linear attention design to optimization strategies. Our core contributions include 5 practical guidelines: 1) Applying depth-wise convolution within simple linear attention is sufficient for image generation. 2) Using fewer heads in linear attention provides a free-lunch performance boost without increasing latency. 3) Inheriting weights from a fully converged, pre-trained DiT. 4) Loading all parameters except those related to linear attention. 5) Hybrid knowledge distillation: using a pre-trained teacher DiT to help the training of the student linear DiT, supervising not only the predicted noise but also the variance of the reverse diffusion process. These guidelines lead to our proposed \underline{L}inear D\underline{i}ffusion \underline{T}ransformer (LiT), which serves as a safe and efficient alternative baseline for DiT with pure linear attention. In class-conditional 256$\times$256 and 512$\times$512 ImageNet generation, LiT can be quickly adapted from DiT using only $20\%$ and $33\%$ of DiT's training steps, respectively, while achieving comparable performance. LiT also rivals methods based on Mamba or Gated Linear Attention. Moreover, the same guidelines generalize to text-to-image generation: LiT can be swiftly converted from PixArt-$\Sigma$ to generate high-quality images, maintaining comparable GenEval scores.</p></details> | 20 pages, 14 figures |

Many people upload these personalized checkpoints online, fostering communities such as Civitai and HuggingFace. However, model owners may overlook the data leakage risks when releasing fine-tuned checkpoints. Moreover, concerns regarding copyright violations arise when unauthorized data is used during fine-tuning. In this paper, we ask: "Can training data be extracted from these fine-tuned DMs shared online?" A successful extraction would present not only data leakage threats but also offer tangible evidence of copyright infringement. To answer this, we propose FineXtract, a framework for extracting fine-tuning data. Our method approximates fine-tuning as a gradual shift in the model's learned distribution -- from the original pretrained DM toward the fine-tuning data. By extrapolating the models before and after fine-tuning, we guide the generation toward high-probability regions within the fine-tuned data distribution. We then apply a clustering algorithm to extract the most probable images from those generated using this extrapolated guidance. Experiments on DMs fine-tuned with datasets including WikiArt, DreamBooth, and real-world checkpoints posted online validate the effectiveness of our method, extracting about 20% of fine-tuning data in most cases.

| **[Unified Multimodal Chain-of-Thought Reward Model through Reinforcement Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03318v2)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal Reward Models (RMs) have shown significant promise in delivering reward signals to align vision models with human preferences. However, current RMs are generally restricted to providing direct responses or engaging in shallow reasoning processes with limited depth, often leading to inaccurate reward signals. We posit that incorporating explicit long chains of thought (CoT) into the reward reasoning process can significantly strengthen their reliability and robustness. Furthermore, we believe that once RMs internalize CoT reasoning, their direct response accuracy can also be improved through implicit reasoning capabilities. To this end, this paper proposes UnifiedReward-Think, the first unified multimodal CoT-based reward model, capable of multi-dimensional, step-by-step long-chain reasoning for both visual understanding and generation reward tasks. Specifically, we adopt an exploration-driven reinforcement fine-tuning approach to elicit and incentivize the model's latent complex reasoning ability: (1) We first use a small amount of image generation preference data to distill the reasoning process of GPT-4o, which is then used for the model's cold start to learn the format and structure of CoT reasoning. (2) Subsequently, by leveraging the model's prior knowledge and generalization capabilities, we prepare large-scale unified multimodal preference data to elicit the model's reasoning process across various vision tasks. During this phase, correct reasoning outputs are retained for rejection sampling to refine the model (3) while incorrect predicted samples are finally used for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based reinforcement fine-tuning, enabling the model to explore diverse reasoning paths and optimize for correct and robust solutions. Extensive experiments across various vision reward tasks demonstrate the superiority of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>[Acce...</summary><p>[Accepted by NeurIPS2025] Project Page: https://codegoat24.github.io/UnifiedReward/think</p></details> |

While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.</p></details> |  |

Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

| **[IDEATOR: Jailbreaking and Benchmarking Large Vision-Language Models Using Themselves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00827v6)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) gain prominence, ensuring their safe deployment has become critical. Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses. VLJailbreakBench is publicly available at https://roywang021.github.io/VLJailbreakBench.</p></details> |  |

Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

| **[Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10568v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.</p></details> |  |

However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |
