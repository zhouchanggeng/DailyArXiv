| **[WP-CLIP: Leveraging CLIP to Predict WÃ¶lfflin's Principles in Visual Art](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12668v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP, on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 AI4VA workshop (oral), Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/wpclip</p></details> |
| **[Style Ambiguity Loss Using CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02055v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore using the style ambiguity training objective, originally used to approximate creativity, on a diffusion model. However, this objective requires the use of a pretrained classifier and a labeled dataset. We introduce new forms of style ambiguity loss that do not require training a new classifier or a labeled dataset. Instead of using a classifier, we generate centroids in the CLIP embedding space, and images are classified based on their relative distance to said centroids. We find the centroids via K-means clustering of an unlabeled dataset, as well as using text labels to generate CLIP embeddings, to be used as centroids.

| **[Continual Learning on CLIP via Incremental Prompt Tuning with Intrinsic Textual Anchors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20680v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[CLAIR: CLIP-Aided Weakly Supervised Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12290v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin, Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | BMVC 2025 |
| **[TokLIP: Marry Visual Tokens to CLIP for Multimodal Comprehension and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05422v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[A CLIP-based Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) Framework for Pedestrian Re-Identification in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11218v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00098v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains. Code of all experiments and benchmarks is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-pfl4asr.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Clipping Improves Adam-Norm and AdaGrad-Norm when the Noise Is Heavy-Tailed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04443v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods with adaptive stepsizes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, are essential for training modern Deep Learning models, especially Large Language Models. Typically, the noise in the stochastic gradients is heavy-tailed for the later ones. Gradient clipping provably helps to achieve good high-probability convergence for such noises. However, despite the similarity between AdaGrad/Adam and Clip-SGD, the current understanding of the high-probability convergence of AdaGrad/Adam-type methods is limited in this case. In this work, we prove that AdaGrad/Adam (and their delayed version) can have provably bad high-probability convergence if the noise is heavy-tailed. We also show that gradient clipping fixes this issue, i.e., we derive new high-probability convergence bounds with polylogarithmic dependence on the confidence level for AdaGrad-Norm and Adam-Norm with clipping and with/without delay for smooth convex/non-convex stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise. We extend our results to the case of AdaGrad/Adam with delayed stepsizes. Our empirical evaluations highlight the superiority of clipped versions of AdaGrad/Adam in handling the heavy-tailed noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025. 65 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Common Data Properties Limit Object-Attribute Binding in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of ``a yellow submarine and a blue bus'' or ``a blue submarine and a yellow bus''. Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in arguably the most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is ``most salient'' to them, have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties does CLIP learn almost perfect binding.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at GCPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Viewpoint Consistency in 3D Generation via Structure Feature and CLIP Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02287v4)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Emotion Recognition with Visual Prototypes: VEGA -- Revisiting CLIP in MERC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06564v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars. These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD.

| **[Explaining Caption-Image Interactions in CLIP Models with Second-Order Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14153v4)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual encoder architectures like Clip models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and predict similarities between them. Despite their wide application, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods explain importances of individual features and can, thus, only provide limited insights into dual encoders, whose predictions depend on interactions between features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to Clip models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. This intrinsic visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes, exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects and we can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories.

| **[Evolution of Low-Level and Texture Human-CLIP Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09814v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations, improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07629v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing AI-Powered Medical Image Synthesis: Insights from MedVQA-GI Challenge Using CLIP, Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion, and Dream-Booth + LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20667v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The MEDVQA-GI challenge addresses the integration of AI-driven text-to-image generative models in medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance diagnostic capabilities through synthetic image generation. Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIPin: A Non-contrastive Plug-in to CLIP for Multimodal Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06434v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks.

| **[Bifrost-1: Bridging Multimodal LLMs and Diffusion Models with Patch-level CLIP Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05954v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bifrost-1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-AGIQA: Boosting the Performance of AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15098v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of generative technologies, AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) have been widely applied in various aspects of daily life. However, due to the immaturity of the technology, the quality of the generated images varies, so it is important to develop quality assessment techniques for the generated images. Although some models have been proposed to assess the quality of generated images, they are inadequate when faced with the ever-increasing and diverse categories of generated images. Consequently, the development of more advanced and effective models for evaluating the quality of generated images is urgently needed. Recent research has explored the significant potential of the visual language model CLIP in image quality assessment, finding that it performs well in evaluating the quality of natural images. However, its application to generated images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we build on this idea and further explore the potential of CLIP in evaluating the quality of generated images. We design CLIP-AGIQA, a CLIP-based regression model for quality assessment of generated images, leveraging rich visual and textual knowledge encapsulated in CLIP. Particularly, we implement multi-category learnable prompts to fully utilize the textual knowledge in CLIP for quality assessment. Extensive experiments on several generated image quality assessment benchmarks, including AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, demonstrate that CLIP-AGIQA outperforms existing IQA models, achieving excellent results in evaluating the quality of generated images.</p></details> | accepted by ICPR2024 |
| **[LeakyCLIP: Extracting Training Data from CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00756v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive Language--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of multimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scendi Score: Prompt-Aware Diversity Evaluation via Schur Complement of CLIP Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18645v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the fidelity of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts, which we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur Complement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware diversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the application of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several numerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate text-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models. Our numerical results indicate the success of the Scendi score in capturing the intrinsic diversity of prompt-guided generative models. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/scendi-score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Textual Semantic Priors for Knowledge Transfer and Refinement in CLIP-Driven Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01579v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored. During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation (SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier. Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[CLIP Brings Better Features to Visual Aesthetics Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15640v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its subjective nature and expensive manual annotations. Recent large-scale vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have shown their promising representation capability for various downstream tasks. However, the application of CLIP to resource-constrained and low-data IAA tasks remains limited. While few attempts to leverage CLIP in IAA have mainly focused on carefully designed prompts, we extend beyond this by allowing models from different domains and with different model sizes to acquire knowledge from CLIP. To achieve this, we propose a unified and flexible two-phase CLIP-based Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) paradigm, aiming to learn a lightweight IAA model while leveraging CLIP's strong generalization capability. Specifically, CSKD employs a feature alignment strategy to facilitate the distillation of heterogeneous CLIP teacher and IAA student models, effectively transferring valuable features from pre-trained visual representations to two lightweight IAA models, respectively. To efficiently adapt to downstream IAA tasks in a low-data regime, the two strong visual aesthetics learners then conduct distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge collaboratively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used IAA benchmarks. Furthermore, analysis of attention distance and entropy before and after feature alignment shows the effective transfer of CLIP's feature representation to IAA models, which not only provides valuable guidance for the model initialization of IAA but also enhances the aesthetic feature representation of IAA models. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | ICME 2025 Oral |
| **[NS-Net: Decoupling CLIP Semantic Information through NULL-Space for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01248v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Patch Correlations in CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks.

Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present Meta CLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, Meta CLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Through extensive experiments, we show that zero-shot CLIP lacks robustness to common image corruptions during test-time, necessitating the adaptation of CLIP to unlabeled corrupted images using test-time adaptation (TTA). However, we found that existing TTA methods have severe limitations in adapting CLIP due to their unimodal nature. To address these limitations, we propose $\texttt{BATCLIP}$, a bimodal $\textbf{online}$ TTA method designed to improve CLIP's robustness to common image corruptions. The key insight of our approach is not only to adapt the visual encoders for improving image features but also to strengthen the alignment between image and text features by promoting a stronger association between the image class prototype, computed using pseudo-labels, and the corresponding text feature. We evaluate our approach on benchmark image corruption datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in online TTA for CLIP. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed TTA approach on various domain generalization datasets to demonstrate its generalization capabilities.

| **[Differentially Private Clipped-SGD: High-Probability Convergence with Arbitrary Clipping Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23512v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy guarantees.</p></details> | 60 pages |

Previous CLIP-based unified methods often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain original comprehension performance while achieving effective image reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional methods, which treat navigation and manipulation as separate tasks, often fail in such 'manipulate-to-navigate' scenarios, as obstacles must be removed before navigation. In these cases, active interaction with the environment is required to clear obstacles while ensuring sufficient space for movement. To address the manipulate-to-navigate problem, we propose a reinforcement learning-based approach for learning manipulation actions that facilitate subsequent navigation. Our method combines manipulability priors to focus the robot on high manipulability body positions with affordance maps for selecting high-quality manipulation actions. By focusing on feasible and meaningful actions, our approach reduces unnecessary exploration and allows the robot to learn manipulation strategies more effectively. We present two new manipulate-to-navigate simulation tasks called Reach and Door with the Boston Dynamics Spot robot. The first task tests whether the robot can select a good hand position in the target area such that the robot base can move effectively forward while keeping the end effector position fixed. The second task requires the robot to move a door aside in order to clear the navigation path. Both of these tasks need first manipulation and then navigating the base forward. Results show that our method allows a robot to effectively interact with and traverse dynamic environments. Finally, we transfer the learned policy to a real Boston Dynamics Spot robot, which successfully performs the Reach task.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13148v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

| **[Improving Detection of Watermarked Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13131v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking has recently emerged as an effective strategy for detecting the generations of large language models (LLMs). The strength of a watermark typically depends strongly on the entropy afforded by the language model and the set of input prompts. However, entropy can be quite limited in practice, especially for models that are post-trained, for example via instruction tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), which makes detection based on watermarking alone challenging. In this work, we investigate whether detection can be improved by combining watermark detectors with non-watermark ones. We explore a number of hybrid schemes that combine the two, observing performance gains over either class of detector under a wide range of experimental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaRL: Learning Scalable Planning Policies with Simple Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17838v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate reinforcement learning (RL) for privileged planning in autonomous driving. State-of-the-art approaches for this task are rule-based, but these methods do not scale to the long tail. RL, on the other hand, is scalable and does not suffer from compounding errors like imitation learning. Contemporary RL approaches for driving use complex shaped rewards that sum multiple individual rewards, \eg~progress, position, or orientation rewards. We show that PPO fails to optimize a popular version of these rewards when the mini-batch size is increased, which limits the scalability of these approaches. Instead, we propose a new reward design based primarily on optimizing a single intuitive reward term: route completion. Infractions are penalized by terminating the episode or multiplicatively reducing route completion. We find that PPO scales well with higher mini-batch sizes when trained with our simple reward, even improving performance. Training with large mini-batch sizes enables efficient scaling via distributed data parallelism. We scale PPO to 300M samples in CARLA and 500M samples in nuPlan with a single 8-GPU node. The resulting model achieves 64 DS on the CARLA longest6 v2 benchmark, outperforming other RL methods with more complex rewards by a large margin. Requiring only minimal adaptations from its use in CARLA, the same method is the best learning-based approach on nuPlan. It scores 91.3 in non-reactive and 90.6 in reactive traffic on the Val14 benchmark while being an order of magnitude faster than prior work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Conference on Robot Learning 2025</p></details> |

In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, built upon Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) pretrained on vast image-text datasets, have emerged as a transformative paradigm. This survey provides the first systematic, taxonomy-oriented review of large VLM-based VLA models for robotic manipulation. We begin by clearly defining large VLM-based VLA models and delineating two principal architectural paradigms: (1) monolithic models, encompassing single-system and dual-system designs with differing levels of integration; and (2) hierarchical models, which explicitly decouple planning from execution via interpretable intermediate representations. Building on this foundation, we present an in-depth examination of large VLM-based VLA models: (1) integration with advanced domains, including reinforcement learning, training-free optimization, learning from human videos, and world model integration; (2) synthesis of distinctive characteristics, consolidating architectural traits, operational strengths, and the datasets and benchmarks that support their development; (3) identification of promising directions, including memory mechanisms, 4D perception, efficient adaptation, multi-agent cooperation, and other emerging capabilities. This survey consolidates recent advances to resolve inconsistencies in existing taxonomies, mitigate research fragmentation, and fill a critical gap through the systematic integration of studies at the intersection of large VLMs and robotic manipulation.

| **[Reinforced Context Order Recovery for Adaptive Reasoning and Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13070v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern causal language models, followed by rapid developments in discrete diffusion models, can now produce a wide variety of interesting and useful content. However, these families of models are predominantly trained to output tokens with a fixed (left-to-right) or random order, which may deviate from the logical order in which tokens are generated originally. In this paper, we observe that current causal and diffusion models encounter difficulties in problems that require adaptive token generation orders to solve tractably, which we characterize with the $\mathcal{V}$-information framework. Motivated by this, we propose Reinforced Context Order Recovery (ReCOR), a reinforcement-learning-based framework to extract adaptive, data-dependent token generation orders from text data without annotations. Self-supervised by token prediction statistics, ReCOR estimates the hardness of predicting every unfilled token and adaptively selects the next token during both training and inference. Experiments on challenging reasoning and planning datasets demonstrate the superior performance of ReCOR compared with baselines, sometimes outperforming oracle models supervised with the ground-truth order.</p></details> |  |

We show that LLMs effectively demonstrate such learning, and provide a detailed study of the phenomena, experimenting with challenging classification tasks and models of sizes from 500M to 70B parameters. This includes identifying and addressing the instability of the process, demonstrating learning with both semantic and abstract labels, and showing scaling trends.

Its success, however, largely depends on strong base models with rich world knowledge, yielding only modest improvements for small-size language models (SLMs). To address this limitation, we investigate Guided GRPO, which injects ground-truth reasoning steps into roll-out trajectories to compensate for SLMs' inherent weaknesses. Through a comprehensive study of various guidance configurations, we find that naively adding guidance delivers limited gains. These insights motivate G$^2$RPO-A, an adaptive algorithm that automatically adjusts guidance strength in response to the model's evolving training dynamics. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code-generation benchmarks confirm that G$^2$RPO-A substantially outperforms vanilla GRPO.

This paper presents a contrasting viewpoint, perceiving data points as interconnected and employing a Markov reward process (MRP) for data modeling. We reformulate the typical supervised learning as an on-policy policy evaluation problem within reinforcement learning (RL), introducing a generalized temporal difference (TD) learning algorithm as a resolution. Theoretically, our analysis establishes connections between the solutions of linear TD learning and ordinary least squares (OLS). Under specific conditions -- particularly when the noise is correlated -- the TD solution serves as a more effective estimator than OLS. Furthermore, we show that when our algorithm is applied with many commonly used loss functions -- such as those found in generalized linear models -- it corresponds to the application of a novel and generalized Bellman operator. We prove that this operator admits a unique fixed point, and based on this, we establish convergence guarantees for our generalized TD algorithm under linear function approximation. Empirical studies verify our theoretical results, examine the vital design of our TD algorithm and show practical utility across various datasets, encompassing tasks such as regression and image classification with deep learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by JAIR.

| **[Breaking Reward Collapse: Adaptive Reinforcement for Open-ended Medical Reasoning with Enhanced Semantic Discrimination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12957v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) with rule-based rewards has demonstrated strong potential in enhancing the reasoning and generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) and large language models (LLMs), while reducing computational overhead. However, its application in medical imaging remains underexplored. Existing reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) approaches in this domain primarily target closed-ended visual question answering (VQA), limiting their applicability to real-world clinical reasoning. In contrast, open-ended medical VQA better reflects clinical practice but has received limited attention. While some efforts have sought to unify both formats via semantically guided RL, we observe that model-based semantic rewards often suffer from reward collapse, where responses with significant semantic differences receive similar scores. To address this, we propose ARMed (Adaptive Reinforcement for Medical Reasoning), a novel RL framework for open-ended medical VQA. ARMed first incorporates domain knowledge through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on chain-of-thought data, then applies reinforcement learning with textual correctness and adaptive semantic rewards to enhance reasoning quality. We evaluate ARMed on six challenging medical VQA benchmarks. Results show that ARMed consistently boosts both accuracy and generalization, achieving a 32.64% improvement on in-domain tasks and an 11.65% gain on out-of-domain benchmarks. These results highlight the critical role of reward discriminability in medical RL and the promise of semantically guided rewards for enabling robust and clinically meaningful multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the known sensitivity of methods to dataset challenges, such as small training sets, noisy labels, and out-of-distribution test-set images, TopoMortar is created to enable in two ways investigating methods' effectiveness at improving topology accuracy. First, by eliminating dataset challenges that, as we show, impact the effectiveness of topology loss functions. Second, by allowing to represent different dataset challenges in the same dataset, isolating methods' performance from dataset challenges. TopoMortar includes three types of labels (accurate, pseudo-labels, and noisy labels), two fixed training sets (large and small), and in-distribution and out-of-distribution test-set images. We compared eight loss functions on TopoMortar, and we found that clDice achieved the most topologically accurate segmentations, and that the relative advantageousness of the other loss functions depends on the experimental setting. Additionally, we show that data augmentation and self-distillation can elevate Cross entropy Dice loss to surpass most topology loss functions, and that those simple methods can enhance topology loss functions as well.

This study investigates the efficacy of the Real-Time Detection Transformer (RT-DETR), a state-of-the-art, end-to-end object detection model, for the automated detection and counting of beach litter. A rigorous comparative analysis is conducted between two model variants, RT-DETR-Large (RT-DETR-L) and RT-DETR-Extra-Large (RT-DETR-X), trained on a publicly available dataset of coastal debris. The evaluation reveals that the RT-DETR-X model achieves marginally superior accuracy, with a mean Average Precision at 50\% IoU (mAP@50) of 0.816 and a mAP@50-95 of 0.612, compared to the RT-DETR-L model's 0.810 and 0.606, respectively. However, this minor performance gain is realized at a significant computational cost; the RT-DETR-L model demonstrates a substantially faster inference time of 20.1 ms versus 34.5 ms for the RT-DETR-X. The findings suggest that the RT-DETR-L model offers a more practical and efficient solution for real-time, in-field deployment due to its superior balance of processing speed and detection accuracy. This research provides valuable insights into the application of advanced Transformer-based detectors for environmental conservation, highlighting the critical trade-offs between model complexity and operational viability.</p></details> |  |

However, many prevalent works focus on single or partial stage fusion, leading to insufficient feature extraction and suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce a multi-stage cross-modal fusion 3D detection framework, termed CMF-IOU, to effectively address the challenge of aligning 3D spatial and 2D semantic information. Specifically, we first project the pixel information into 3D space via a depth completion network to get the pseudo points, which unifies the representation of the LiDAR and camera information. Then, a bilateral cross-view enhancement 3D backbone is designed to encode LiDAR points and pseudo points. The first sparse-to-distant (S2D) branch utilizes an encoder-decoder structure to reinforce the representation of sparse LiDAR points. The second residual view consistency (ResVC) branch is proposed to mitigate the influence of inaccurate pseudo points via both the 3D and 2D convolution processes. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative voxel-point aware fine grained pooling module, which captures the spatial information from LiDAR points and textural information from pseudo points in the proposal refinement stage. To achieve more precise refinement during iteration, an intersection over union (IoU) joint prediction branch integrated with a novel proposals generation technique is designed to preserve the bounding boxes with both high IoU and classification scores. Extensive experiments show the superior performance of our method on the KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The P...</summary><p>The Paper is Accepted by TCSVT</p></details> |

To alleviate the negative impact of hard samples on training the Flying Bird Object Detection (FBOD) model for surveillance videos, we propose the Co-Paced Learning strategy Based on Confidence (CPL-BC) and apply it to the training process of the FBOD model. This strategy involves maintaining two models with identical structures but different initial parameter configurations that collaborate with each other to select easy samples for training, where the prediction confidence exceeds a set threshold. As training progresses, the strategy gradually lowers the threshold, thereby gradually enhancing the model's ability to recognize objects, from easier to more hard ones. Prior to applying CPL-BC, we pre-trained the two FBOD models to equip them with the capability to assess the difficulty of flying bird object samples. Experimental results on two different datasets of flying bird objects in surveillance videos demonstrate that, compared to other model learning strategies, CPL-BC significantly improves detection accuracy, thereby verifying the method's effectiveness and advancement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Rendering for Sensor Adaptation in 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12695v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles often have varying camera sensor setups, which is inevitable due to restricted placement options for different vehicle types. Training a perception model on one particular setup and evaluating it on a new, different sensor setup reveals the so-called cross-sensor domain gap, typically leading to a degradation in accuracy. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the cross-sensor domain gap on state-of-the-art 3D object detectors. To this end, we introduce CamShift, a dataset inspired by nuScenes and created in CARLA to specifically simulate the domain gap between subcompact vehicles and sport utility vehicles (SUVs). Using CamShift, we demonstrate significant cross-sensor performance degradation, identify robustness dependencies on model architecture, and propose a data-driven solution to mitigate the effect. On the one hand, we show that model architectures based on a dense Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation with backward projection, such as BEVFormer, are the most robust against varying sensor configurations. On the other hand, we propose a novel data-driven sensor adaptation pipeline based on neural rendering, which can transform entire datasets to match different camera sensor setups. Applying this approach improves performance across all investigated 3D object detectors, mitigating the cross-sensor domain gap by a large margin and reducing the need for new data collection by enabling efficient data reusability across vehicles with different sensor setups.

| **[Refine-and-Contrast: Adaptive Instance-Aware BEV Representations for Multi-UAV Collaborative Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12684v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-UAV collaborative 3D detection enables accurate and robust perception by fusing multi-view observations from aerial platforms, offering significant advantages in coverage and occlusion handling, while posing new challenges for computation on resource-constrained UAV platforms. In this paper, we present AdaBEV, a novel framework that learns adaptive instance-aware BEV representations through a refine-and-contrast paradigm. Unlike existing methods that treat all BEV grids equally, AdaBEV introduces a Box-Guided Refinement Module (BG-RM) and an Instance-Background Contrastive Learning (IBCL) to enhance semantic awareness and feature discriminability. BG-RM refines only BEV grids associated with foreground instances using 2D supervision and spatial subdivision, while IBCL promotes stronger separation between foreground and background features via contrastive learning in BEV space. Extensive experiments on the Air-Co-Pred dataset demonstrate that AdaBEV achieves superior accuracy-computation trade-offs across model scales, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods at low resolutions and approaching upper bound performance while maintaining low-resolution BEV inputs and negligible overhead.</p></details> | 9 pages |

To address these shortcomings, this paper proposes InsightX Agent, a novel LMM-based agentic framework designed to deliver reliable, interpretable, and interactive X-ray NDT analysis. Unlike typical sequential pipelines, InsightX Agent positions a Large Multimodal Model (LMM) as a central orchestrator, coordinating between the Sparse Deformable Multi-Scale Detector (SDMSD) and the Evidence-Grounded Reflection (EGR) tool. The SDMSD generates dense defect region proposals for multi-scale feature maps and sparsifies them through Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), optimizing detection of small, dense targets in X-ray images while maintaining computational efficiency. The EGR tool guides the LMM agent through a chain-of-thought-inspired review process, incorporating context assessment, individual defect analysis, false positive elimination, confidence recalibration and quality assurance to validate and refine the SDMSD's initial proposals. By strategically employing and intelligently using tools, InsightX Agent moves beyond passive data processing to active reasoning, enhancing diagnostic reliability and providing interpretations that integrate diverse information sources. Experimental evaluations on the GDXray+ dataset demonstrate that InsightX Agent not only achieves a high object detection F1-score of 96.35% but also offers significantly improved interpretability and trustworthiness in its analyses, highlighting the transformative potential of agentic LLM frameworks for industrial inspection tasks.</p></details> |  |

In response, this work presents Visual Perception Engine (VPEngine), a modular framework designed to enable efficient GPU usage for visual multitasking while maintaining extensibility and developer accessibility. Our framework architecture leverages a shared foundation model backbone that extracts image representations, which are efficiently shared, without any unnecessary GPU-CPU memory transfers, across multiple specialized task-specific model heads running in parallel. This design eliminates the computational redundancy inherent in feature extraction component when deploying traditional sequential models while enabling dynamic task prioritization based on application demands. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities through an example implementation using DINOv2 as the foundation model with multiple task (depth, object detection and semantic segmentation) heads, achieving up to 3x speedup compared to sequential execution. Building on CUDA Multi-Process Service (MPS), VPEngine offers efficient GPU utilization and maintains a constant memory footprint while allowing per-task inference frequencies to be adjusted dynamically during runtime. The framework is written in Python and is open source with ROS2 C++ (Humble) bindings for ease of use by the robotics community across diverse robotic platforms. Our example implementation demonstrates end-to-end real-time performance at $\geq$50 Hz on NVIDIA Jetson Orin AGX for TensorRT optimized models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In the context of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), repetitive motor behaviors such as spinning, head banging, and arm flapping are key indicators for diagnosis. This study focuses on distinguishing between children with ASD and typically developed (TD) peers by analyzing videos captured in natural, uncontrolled environments. Using the publicly available Self-Stimulatory Behavior Dataset (SSBD), we address the classification task as a binary problem, ASD vs. TD, based on stereotypical repetitive gestures. We adopt a pipeline integrating YOLOv7-based detection, extensive video augmentations, and the VideoMAE framework, which efficiently captures both spatial and temporal features through a high-ratio masking and reconstruction strategy. Our proposed approach achieves 95% accuracy, 0.93 precision, 0.94 recall, and 0.94 F1 score, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by a significant margin. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining advanced object detection, robust data augmentation, and masked autoencoder-based video modeling for reliable ASD vs. TD classification in naturalistic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Change Note for Version 3 - Extended Study (ASD vs TD Classification) This version extends v2 from 3-class gesture recognition to binary ASD vs TD detection, using expanded SSBD variants, a new TD class, improved preprocessing, and updated metrics (95% acc, 0.93 prec, 0.94 rec, 0.94 F1).

However, existing S4 studies often rely on small-scale datasets and models, limiting their practical applicability. To address this, we propose S5, the first scalable framework for semi-supervised semantic segmentation in RS, which unlocks the potential of vast unlabeled Earth observation data typically underutilized due to costly pixel-level annotations. Built upon existing large-scale RS datasets, S5 introduces a data selection strategy that integrates entropy-based filtering and diversity expansion, resulting in the RS4P-1M dataset. Using this dataset, we systematically scales S4 methods by pre-training RS foundation models (RSFMs) of varying sizes on this extensive corpus, significantly boosting their performance on land cover segmentation and object detection tasks. Furthermore, during fine-tuning, we incorporate a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based multi-dataset fine-tuning approach, which enables efficient adaptation to multiple RS benchmarks with fewer parameters. This approach improves the generalization and versatility of RSFMs across diverse RS benchmarks. The resulting RSFMs achieve state-of-the-art performance across all benchmarks, underscoring the viability of scaling semi-supervised learning for RS applications. All datasets, code, and models will be released at https://github.com/MiliLab/S5</p></details> |  |

To address this, we propose AquaFeat, a novel, plug-and-play module that performs task-driven feature enhancement. Our approach integrates a multi-scale feature enhancement network trained end-to-end with the detector's loss function, ensuring the enhancement process is explicitly guided to refine features most relevant to the detection task. When integrated with YOLOv8m on challenging underwater datasets, AquaFeat achieves state-of-the-art Precision (0.877) and Recall (0.624), along with competitive mAP scores (mAP@0.5 of 0.677 and mAP@[0.5:0.95] of 0.421). By delivering these accuracy gains while maintaining a practical processing speed of 46.5 FPS, our model provides an effective and computationally efficient solution for real-world applications, such as marine ecosystem monitoring and infrastructure inspection.</p></details> |  |

This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first comprehensive survey for multi-modal visual object tracking; 6 multi-modal tasks; 338 references</p></details> |

It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity.

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-State Tracker: Enhancing Efficient Object Tracking via Multi-State Specialization and Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11531v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG) and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD) design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency for Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11323v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serial Over Parallel: Learning Continual Unification for Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10655v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks, causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data, reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by 27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format, progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity. Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 |

However, vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive. We show the effectiveness of radar-based fusion in safety-critical scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance.

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |

Through controlled Online Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements (AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual SLAMMOT Considering Multiple Motion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19134v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress, the intrinsic relationship between the two subtasks of tracking and referring in RMOT has not been fully studied. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of their interdependence, revealing that current two-stage Referring-by-Tracking (RBT) frameworks remain fundamentally limited by insufficient modeling of subtask interactions and inflexible reliance on semantic alignment modules like CLIP. To this end, we propose JustHook, a novel two-stage RBT framework where a Hook module is firstly designed to redefine the linkage between subtasks. The Hook is built centered on grid sampling at the feature-level and is used for context-aware target feature extraction. Moreover, we propose a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD) that learns in a unified joint feature space rather than relying on pre-defined cross-modal embeddings. Our design not only enhances the interpretability and modularity but also significantly improves the generalization. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTI-V2, and Refer-Dance demonstrate that JustHook achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the HOTA by +6.9\% on Refer-KITTI-V2 with superior efficiency. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity.

Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of 67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic objects and class types</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08219v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views.

| **[GRASPTrack: Geometry-Reasoned Association via Segmentation and Projection for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08117v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear swimming patterns of fish and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios.

| **[SUIT: Spatial-Spectral Union-Intersection Interaction Network for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07250v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code, trained models and results will be publicly available via https://github.com/bearshng/suit to support reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Street Gaussians without 3D Object Tracker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05548v3)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic scene reconstruction in driving scenarios poses significant challenges due to fast-moving objects. Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS methods still struggle under real-world complexities.

| **[Head Anchor Enhanced Detection and Association for Crowded Pedestrian Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05514v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection features from both the regression and classification branches of an object detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions, integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes. By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded environments where occlusions are prevalent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-tracklet Tracking for Generic Targets with Adaptive Detection Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05172v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association. Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Existing systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates an engaging presentation experience.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker.

We present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves an average of 50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses, and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view synthesis over baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |

Today, most algorithms focus on generating attack samples and do not take into account the limited number of bona fide images. This work is one of the first to propose a method for mimicking bona fide images by generating synthetic versions of them using Stable Diffusion, which may help improve the generalisation capabilities of the detector. Furthermore, the new images generated are evaluated in a system trained from scratch and in a commercial solution. The PAD system yields an interesting result, as it identifies our images as bona fide, which has a positive impact on detection performance and data restrictions.</p></details> |  |

While Continuous Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CcGANs) were designed for this task, their instability during adversarial learning often leads to suboptimal results. Conditional Diffusion Models (CDMs) offer a promising alternative, generating more realistic images, but their diffusion processes, label conditioning, and model fitting procedures are either not optimized for or incompatible with CCGM, making it difficult to integrate CcGANs' vicinal approach. To address these issues, we introduce Continuous Conditional Diffusion Models (CCDMs), the first CDM specifically tailored for CCGM. CCDMs address existing limitations with specially designed conditional diffusion processes, a novel hard vicinal image denoising loss, a customized label embedding method, and efficient conditional sampling procedures. Through comprehensive experiments on four datasets with resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 192x192, we demonstrate that CCDMs outperform state-of-the-art CCGM models, establishing a new benchmark. Ablation studies further validate the model design and implementation, highlighting that some widely used CDM implementations are ineffective for the CCGM task.

| **[Hyperspectral Image Generation with Unmixing Guided Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02601v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, hyperspectral image generation has received increasing attention, but existing generative models rely on conditional generation schemes, which limits the diversity of generated images. Diffusion models are popular for their ability to generate high-quality samples, but adapting these models from RGB to hyperspectral data presents the challenge of high dimensionality and physical constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel diffusion model guided by hyperspectral unmixing. Our model comprises two key modules: an unmixing autoencoder module and an abundance diffusion module. The unmixing autoencoder module leverages unmixing guidance to shift the generative task from the image space to the low-dimensional abundance space, significantly reducing computational complexity while preserving high fidelity. The abundance diffusion module generates samples that satisfy the constraints of non-negativity and unity, ensuring the physical consistency of the reconstructed HSIs. Additionally, we introduce two evaluation metrics tailored to hyperspectral data. Empirical results, evaluated using both traditional metrics and our proposed metrics, indicate that our model is capable of generating high-quality and diverse hyperspectral images, offering an advancement in hyperspectral data generation.</p></details> |  |

As a result, their adoption has increased in many computer vision applications, ranging from content creation to synthetic data generation. A critical challenge is achieving precise alignment between the image, textual prompt, and layout, ensuring semantic fidelity and spatial accuracy. Although recent benchmarks assess text alignment, layout alignment remains overlooked, and no existing benchmark jointly evaluates both. This gap limits the ability to evaluate a model's spatial fidelity, which is crucial when using layout-guided generation for synthetic data, as errors can introduce noise and degrade data quality. In this work, we introduce 7Bench, the first benchmark to assess both semantic and spatial alignment in layout-guided text-to-image generation. It features text-and-layout pairs spanning seven challenging scenarios, investigating object generation, color fidelity, attribute recognition, inter-object relationships, and spatial control. We propose an evaluation protocol that builds on existing frameworks by incorporating the layout alignment score to assess spatial accuracy. Using 7Bench, we evaluate several state-of-the-art diffusion models, uncovering their respective strengths and limitations across diverse alignment tasks.

However, existing ControlNet-like methods struggle with compositional visual conditioning - simultaneously preserving semantic fidelity across multiple heterogeneous control signals while maintaining high visual quality, where they employ separate control branches that often introduce conflicting guidance during the denoising process, leading to structural distortions and artifacts in generated images. To address this issue, we present PixelPonder, a novel unified control framework, which allows for effective control of multiple visual conditions under a single control structure. Specifically, we design a patch-level adaptive condition selection mechanism that dynamically prioritizes spatially relevant control signals at the sub-region level, enabling precise local guidance without global interference. Additionally, a time-aware control injection scheme is deployed to modulate condition influence according to denoising timesteps, progressively transitioning from structural preservation to texture refinement and fully utilizing the control information from different categories to promote more harmonious image generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PixelPonder surpasses previous methods across different benchmark datasets, showing superior improvement in spatial alignment accuracy while maintaining high textual semantic consistency.</p></details> |  |

In CVTG, image generation models often rendering distorted and blurred visual text or missing some visual text. To tackle these challenges, we propose TextCrafter, a novel multi-visual text rendering method. TextCrafter employs a progressive strategy to decompose complex visual text into distinct components while ensuring robust alignment between textual content and its visual carrier. Additionally, it incorporates a token focus enhancement mechanism to amplify the prominence of visual text during the generation process. TextCrafter effectively addresses key challenges in CVTG tasks, such as text confusion, omissions, and blurriness. Moreover, we present a new benchmark dataset, CVTG-2K, tailored to rigorously evaluate the performance of generative models on CVTG tasks.

| **[Next Visual Granularity Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12811v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30 -> 3.03, 2.57 ->2.44, 2.09 -> 2.06). We also conduct extensive analysis to showcase the capability and potential of the NVG framework. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-Reference Text-to-Image Manipulation with Dual Contrastive Denoising Score](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12718v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale text-to-image generative models have shown remarkable ability to synthesize diverse and high-quality images. However, it is still challenging to directly apply these models for editing real images for two reasons. First, it is difficult for users to come up with a perfect text prompt that accurately describes every visual detail in the input image. Second, while existing models can introduce desirable changes in certain regions, they often dramatically alter the input content and introduce unexpected changes in unwanted regions. To address these challenges, we present Dual Contrastive Denoising Score, a simple yet powerful framework that leverages the rich generative prior of text-to-image diffusion models. Inspired by contrastive learning approaches for unpaired image-to-image translation, we introduce a straightforward dual contrastive loss within the proposed framework. Our approach utilizes the extensive spatial information from the intermediate representations of the self-attention layers in latent diffusion models without depending on auxiliary networks. Our method achieves both flexible content modification and structure preservation between input and output images, as well as zero-shot image-to-image translation. Through extensive experiments, we show that our approach outperforms existing methods in real image editing while maintaining the capability to directly utilize pretrained text-to-image diffusion models without further training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stable Diffusion-Based Approach for Human De-Occlusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12663v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans can infer the missing parts of an occluded object by leveraging prior knowledge and visible cues. However, enabling deep learning models to accurately predict such occluded regions remains a challenging task. De-occlusion addresses this problem by reconstructing both the mask and RGB appearance. In this work, we focus on human de-occlusion, specifically targeting the recovery of occluded body structures and appearances. Our approach decomposes the task into two stages: mask completion and RGB completion. The first stage leverages a diffusion-based human body prior to provide a comprehensive representation of body structure, combined with occluded joint heatmaps that offer explicit spatial cues about missing regions. The reconstructed amodal mask then serves as a conditioning input for the second stage, guiding the model on which areas require RGB reconstruction. To further enhance RGB generation, we incorporate human-specific textual features derived using a visual question answering (VQA) model and encoded via a CLIP encoder. RGB completion is performed using Stable Diffusion, with decoder fine-tuning applied to mitigate pixel-level degradation in visible regions -- a known limitation of prior diffusion-based de-occlusion methods caused by latent space transformations. Our method effectively reconstructs human appearances even under severe occlusions and consistently outperforms existing methods in both mask and RGB completion. Moreover, the de-occluded images generated by our approach can improve the performance of downstream human-centric tasks, such as 2D pose estimation and 3D human reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | MM 2025 |
