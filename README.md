| **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training CLIP against Data Poisoning with Optimal Transport-based Matching and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18717v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Main |
| **[GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoCLIP-Lite: Efficient Video Recognition by Fusing CLIP with Motion Vectors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17084v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCLIP-Lite.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[CardiacCLIP: Video-based CLIP Adaptation for LVEF Prediction in a Few-shot Manner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17065v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echocardiography is a vital non-invasive modality for cardiac assessment, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) serving as a key indicator of heart function. Existing LVEF estimation methods depend on large-scale annotated video datasets, which are costly and limit adaptability across various clinical settings. Recent vision-language models for echocardiography, such as EchoCLIP, apply image-to-text pretraining but fail to capture crucial temporal dynamics and localized cardiac structures essential for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose CardiacCLIP, a video-based framework that enhances LVEF prediction through attention-based frame aggregation and multi-resolution input scaling. Specifically, we introduce MFL (Multi Frame Learning), a novel attention-based mechanism for selectively fusing informative frames, and EchoZoom, a multi-scale feature extraction strategy that refines spatial representations of cardiac structures. As a novel adaptation of CLIP models for few-shot echocardiogram video analysis, our approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing MAE by 2.07 on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset under 1-shot setting. The code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/CardiacCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Antidote: Class-Wise Prompt Tuning for Purifying Backdoors in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19269v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit impressive representational capabilities for multimodal data, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. To alleviate the threat, existing defense strategies primarily focus on fine-tuning the entire suspicious model. However, the substantial model parameters increase the difficulty of reaching a stable and consistent optimization direction, limiting their resistance against state-of-the-art attacks and often resulting in a degradation of clean accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose Class-wise Backdoor Prompt Tuning (CBPT), an efficient and effective defense mechanism that operates on text prompts to indirectly purify poisoned CLIP. Specifically, we first employ the advanced contrastive learning via carefully crafted positive and negative samples, to effectively invert the backdoor triggers that are potentially adopted by the attacker. Once the dummy trigger is established, we leverage three well-designed loss functions to optimize these class-wise text prompts, modifying the model's decision boundary and further reclassifying the feature regions affected by backdoor triggers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBPT significantly mitigates backdoor threats while preserving model utility, e.g. an average Clean Accuracy (CA) of 58.83% and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.39% across seven mainstream backdoor attacks. These results underscore the superiority of our prompt purifying design to strengthen CLIP's robustness against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Brain Signal Generation for Visual Prosthesis with CLIP Guided Multimodal Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present, to our knowledge, the first image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed framework comprises two key components: a pretrained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that reconstructs brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules capture the complex interplay between visual features and brain signal representations, enabling fine-grained alignment during generation. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals. We also present visualizations of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning the Paradox: How CLIP's Most Informative Heads Enhance Performance While Amplifying Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11103v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is one of the most popular foundation models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks, yet little is known about its inner workings. As CLIP is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is becoming even more critical to understand its limitations and embedded social biases to mitigate potentially harmful downstream consequences. However, the question of what internal mechanisms drive both the impressive capabilities as well as problematic shortcomings of CLIP has largely remained unanswered. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations which amplify social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAGIC-Enhanced Keyword Prompting for Zero-Shot Audio Captioning with CLIP Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12591v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models, eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no keyword list is used.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 26th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE), scheduled for 15-17 December 2025 in Marrakech, Morocco</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

| **[When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.</p></details> | BIBM |
| **[DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLSM-Ensemble: Ensembling CLIP-based Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05154v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community.

| **[TriCLIP-3D: A Unified Parameter-Efficient Framework for Tri-Modal 3D Visual Grounding based on CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14904v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |

However, these tasks are often left out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with the commonly used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures. 8th annual conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |

However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> |

RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

| **[Language-Aware Information Maximization for Transductive Few-Shot CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00305v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly, we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot setting.

However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at CIKM 2025 (ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management)</p></details> |

Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been demonstrated to overly rely on spurious cues within the textual modality, revealing a limited ability to genuinely identify sarcasm through nuanced text-image interactions. To solve this problem, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, which introduces Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) with an efficient training strategy to extract enriched text-image representations by embedding cross-modal information directly into each encoder. Additionally, we design a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP) with a dynamic dual-channel memory that stores valuable test sample knowledge during inference, acting as a non-parametric classifier for robust sarcasm recognition. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant accuracy and F1 score improvements on MMSD and MMSD2.0.

| **[Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP. In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, code:https://github.com/chi-chi-zx/FSA</p></details> |
| **[ReCLIP++: Learn to Rectify the Bias of CLIP for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06747v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works utilize CLIP to perform the challenging unsupervised semantic segmentation task where only images without annotations are available. However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts. The implementation is available at: https://github.com/dogehhh/ReCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our CVPR 24 paper</p></details> |

| **[Residual Off-Policy RL for Finetuning Behavior Cloning Policies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19301v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in behavior cloning (BC) have enabled impressive visuomotor control policies. However, these approaches are limited by the quality of human demonstrations, the manual effort required for data collection, and the diminishing returns from increasing offline data. In comparison, reinforcement learning (RL) trains an agent through autonomous interaction with the environment and has shown remarkable success in various domains. Still, training RL policies directly on real-world robots remains challenging due to sample inefficiency, safety concerns, and the difficulty of learning from sparse rewards for long-horizon tasks, especially for high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems. We present a recipe that combines the benefits of BC and RL through a residual learning framework. Our approach leverages BC policies as black-box bases and learns lightweight per-step residual corrections via sample-efficient off-policy RL. We demonstrate that our method requires only sparse binary reward signals and can effectively improve manipulation policies on high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) systems in both simulation and the real world. In particular, we demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful real-world RL training on a humanoid robot with dexterous hands. Our results demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in various vision-based tasks, pointing towards a practical pathway for deploying RL in the real world.

Leveraging specific types of privileged information during training to mitigate the effects of partial observability has yielded notable empirical successes. In this paper, we propose Asymmetric Constrained Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (ACPOMDPs) to theoretically examine the advantages of incorporating privileged information in Safe RL. Building upon ACPOMDPs, we propose the Privileged Information Guided Dreamer (PIGDreamer), a model-based RL approach that leverages privileged information to enhance the agent's safety and performance through privileged representation alignment and an asymmetric actor-critic structure. Our empirical results demonstrate that PIGDreamer significantly outperforms existing Safe RL methods. Furthermore, compared to alternative privileged RL methods, our approach exhibits enhanced performance, robustness, and efficiency.

| **[Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19249v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing disparity between the exponential scaling of computational resources and the finite growth of high-quality text data now constrains conventional scaling approaches for large language models (LLMs). To address this challenge, we introduce Reinforcement Learning on Pre-Training data (RLPT), a new training-time scaling paradigm for optimizing LLMs. In contrast to prior approaches that scale training primarily through supervised learning, RLPT enables the policy to autonomously explore meaningful trajectories to learn from pre-training data and improve its capability through reinforcement learning (RL). While existing RL strategies such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) rely on human annotation for reward construction, RLPT eliminates this dependency by deriving reward signals directly from pre-training data. Specifically, it adopts a next-segment reasoning objective, rewarding the policy for accurately predicting subsequent text segments conditioned on the preceding context. This formulation allows RL to be scaled on pre-training data, encouraging the exploration of richer trajectories across broader contexts and thereby fostering more generalizable reasoning skills. Extensive experiments on both general-domain and mathematical reasoning benchmarks across multiple models validate the effectiveness of RLPT. For example, when applied to Qwen3-4B-Base, RLPT yields absolute improvements of $3.0$, $5.1$, $8.1$, $6.0$, $6.6$, and $5.3$ on MMLU, MMLU-Pro, GPQA-Diamond, KOR-Bench, AIME24, and AIME25, respectively. The results further demonstrate favorable scaling behavior, suggesting strong potential for continued gains with more compute. In addition, RLPT provides a solid foundation, extending the reasoning boundaries of LLMs and enhancing RLVR performance.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Online Process Reward Leanring for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19199v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) as autonomous agents that reason and act over long horizons in interactive environments. However, sparse and sometimes unverifiable rewards make temporal credit assignment extremely challenging. Recent work attempts to integrate process supervision into agent learning but suffers from biased annotation, reward hacking, high-variance from overly fine-grained signals or failtures when state overlap is rare. We therefore introduce Online Process Reward Learning (OPRL), a general credit-assignment strategy for agentic RL that integrates seamlessly with standard on-policy algorithms without relying on additional rollouts or explicit step labels. In OPRL, we optimize an implicit process reward model (PRM) alternately with the agent's policy to transform trajectory preferences into implicit step rewards through a trajectory-based DPO objective. These step rewards are then used to compute step-level advantages, which are combined with episode-level advantages from outcome rewards for policy update, creating a self-reinforcing loop. Theoretical findings guarantee that the learned step rewards are consistent with trajectory preferences and act as potential-based shaping rewards, providing bounded gradients to stabilize training. Empirically, we evaluate OPRL on three distinct agent benmarks, including WebShop and VisualSokoban, as well as open-ended social interactions with unverfiable rewards in SOTOPIA. Crucially, OPRL shows superior performance over frontier LLMs and strong RL baselines across domains, achieving state-of-the-art results with higher sample-efficiency and lower variance during training. Further analysis also demonstrates the efficient exploration by OPRL using fewer actions, underscoring its potential for agentic learning in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Soft Tokens, Hard Truths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19170v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of continuous instead of discrete tokens during the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) phase of reasoning LLMs has garnered attention recently, based on the intuition that a continuous mixture of discrete tokens could simulate a superposition of several reasoning paths simultaneously. Theoretical results have formally proven that continuous tokens have much greater expressivity and can solve specific problems more efficiently. However, practical use of continuous tokens has been limited by strong training difficulties: previous works either just use continuous tokens at inference time on a pre-trained discrete-token model, or must distill the continuous CoT from ground-truth discrete CoTs and face computational costs that limit the CoT to very few tokens. This is the first work introducing a scalable method to learn continuous CoTs via reinforcement learning (RL), without distilling from reference discrete CoTs. We use "soft" tokens: mixtures of tokens together with noise on the input embedding to provide RL exploration. Computational overhead is minimal, enabling us to learn continuous CoTs with hundreds of tokens. On math reasoning benchmarks with Llama and Qwen models up to 8B, training with continuous CoTs match discrete-token CoTs for pass@1 and surpass them for pass@32, showing greater CoT diversity. In systematic comparisons, the best-performing scenario is to train with continuous CoT tokens then use discrete tokens for inference, meaning the "soft" models can be deployed in a standard way. Finally, we show continuous CoT RL training better preserves the predictions of the base model on out-of-domain tasks, thus providing a softer touch to the base model.</p></details> |  |

We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Subgoal at a Time: Zero-Shot Generalization to Arbitrary Linear Temporal Logic Requirements in Multi-Task Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01561v5)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing to complex and temporally extended task objectives and safety constraints remains a critical challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Linear temporal logic (LTL) offers a unified formalism to specify such requirements, yet existing methods are limited in their abilities to handle nested long-horizon tasks and safety constraints, and cannot identify situations when a subgoal is not satisfiable and an alternative should be sought. In this paper, we introduce GenZ-LTL, a method that enables zero-shot generalization to arbitrary LTL specifications. GenZ-LTL leverages the structure of B\"uchi automata to decompose an LTL task specification into sequences of reach-avoid subgoals. Contrary to the current state-of-the-art method that conditions on subgoal sequences, we show that it is more effective to achieve zero-shot generalization by solving these reach-avoid problems \textit{one subgoal at a time} through proper safe RL formulations. In addition, we introduce a novel subgoal-induced observation reduction technique that can mitigate the exponential complexity of subgoal-state combinations under realistic assumptions. Empirical results show that GenZ-LTL substantially outperforms existing methods in zero-shot generalization to unseen LTL specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Reinforcement Learning by Reducing Forgetting with Elephant Activation Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19159v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Catastrophic forgetting has remained a significant challenge for efficient reinforcement learning for decades (Ring 1994, Rivest and Precup 2003). While recent works have proposed effective methods to mitigate this issue, they mainly focus on the algorithmic side. Meanwhile, we do not fully understand what architectural properties of neural networks lead to catastrophic forgetting. This study aims to fill this gap by studying the role of activation functions in the training dynamics of neural networks and their impact on catastrophic forgetting in reinforcement learning setup. Our study reveals that, besides sparse representations, the gradient sparsity of activation functions also plays an important role in reducing forgetting. Based on this insight, we propose a new class of activation functions, elephant activation functions, that can generate both sparse outputs and sparse gradients. We show that by simply replacing classical activation functions with elephant activation functions in the neural networks of value-based algorithms, we can significantly improve the resilience of neural networks to catastrophic forgetting, thus making reinforcement learning more sample-efficient and memory-efficient.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code release: https://github.com/qlan3/ENN</p></details> |
| **[PipelineRL: Faster On-policy Reinforcement Learning for Long Sequence Generatio](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19128v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key contribution.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, the training process tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final interception velocity of 15 m/s.</p></details> |  |

However, existing offline RLHF approaches suffer from overoptimization, where models overfit to reward misspecification and drift from preferred behaviors observed during training. We introduce DRO-REBEL, a unified family of robust REBEL updates with type-$p$ Wasserstein, KL, and $\chi^2$ ambiguity sets. Using Fenchel duality, each update reduces to a simple relative-reward regression, preserving scalability and avoiding PPO-style clipping or auxiliary value networks. Under standard linear-reward and log-linear policy classes with a data-coverage condition, we establish $O(n^{-1/4})$ estimation bounds with tighter constants than prior DRO-DPO approaches, and recover the minimax-optimal $O(n^{-1/2})$ rate via a localized Rademacher complexity analysis. The same analysis closes the gap for Wasserstein-DPO and KL-DPO, showing both also attain optimal parametric rates. We derive practical SGD algorithms for all three divergences: gradient regularization (Wasserstein), importance weighting (KL), and a fast 1-D dual solve ($\chi^2$). Experiments on Emotion Alignment, the large-scale ArmoRM multi-objective benchmark, and HH-Alignment demonstrate strong worst-case robustness across unseen preference mixtures, model sizes, and data scales, with $\chi^2$-REBEL showing consistently strong empirical performance. A controlled radius--coverage study validates a no-free-lunch trade-off: radii shrinking faster than empirical divergence concentration rates achieve minimax-optimal parametric rates but forfeit coverage, while coverage-guaranteeing radii incur $O(n^{-1/4})$ rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[World4RL: Diffusion World Models for Policy Refinement with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19080v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.

| **[AvatarShield: Visual Reinforcement Learning for Human-Centric Synthetic Video Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15173v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content have led to highly realistic synthetic videos, particularly in human-centric scenarios involving speech, gestures, and full-body motion, posing serious threats to information authenticity and public trust. Unlike DeepFake techniques that focus on localized facial manipulation, human-centric video generation methods can synthesize entire human bodies with controllable movements, enabling complex interactions with environments, objects, and even other people. However, existing detection methods largely overlook the growing risks posed by such full-body synthetic content. Meanwhile, a growing body of research has explored leveraging LLMs for interpretable fake detection, aiming to explain decisions in natural language. Yet these approaches heavily depend on supervised fine-tuning, which introduces limitations such as annotation bias, hallucinated supervision, and weakened generalization. To address these challenges, we propose AvatarShield, a novel multimodal human-centric synthetic video detection framework that eliminates the need for dense textual supervision by adopting Group Relative Policy Optimization, enabling LLMs to develop reasoning capabilities from simple binary labels. Our architecture combines a discrete vision tower for high-level semantic inconsistencies and a residual extractor for fine-grained artifact analysis. We further introduce FakeHumanVid, a large-scale benchmark containing 15K real and synthetic videos across nine state-of-the-art human generation methods driven by text, pose, or audio. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AvatarShield outperforms existing methods in both in-domain and cross-domain settings.</p></details> |  |

Offline Imitation learning (IL) avoids these risks by collecting expert demonstrations safely, training entirely offline, and deploying policies zero-shot. However, we find that naively applying Behaviour Cloning (BC) to social navigation is insufficient; achieving strong performance requires careful architectural and training choices. We present Ratatouille, a pipeline and model architecture that, without changing the data, reduces collisions per meter by 6 times and improves success rate by 3 times compared to naive BC. We validate our approach in both simulation and the real world, where we collected over 11 hours of data on a dense university campus. We further demonstrate qualitative results in a public food court. Our findings highlight that thoughtful IL design, rather than additional data, can substantially improve safety and reliability in real-world social navigation. Video: https://youtu.be/tOdLTXsaYLQ.

In the first stage, a compact 4-DOF (four-degree-of-freedom) reduced-order model (ROM) is trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. This generates energy-efficient gait templates. In the second stage, those dynamically consistent trajectories guide a full-body policy trained with Soft Actor--Critic augmented by an adversarial discriminator, ensuring the student's five-dimensional gait feature distribution matches the ROM's demonstrations. Experiments at 1 meter-per-second and 4 meter-per-second show that ROM-GRL produces stable, symmetric gaits with substantially lower tracking error than a pure-reward baseline. By distilling lightweight ROM guidance into high-dimensional policies, ROM-GRL bridges the gap between reward-only and imitation-based locomotion methods, enabling versatile, naturalistic humanoid behaviors without any human demonstrations.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, Computational Science Graduate Project</p></details> |
| **[Fully Learnable Neural Reward Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19017v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Non-Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) tasks present significant challenges, as agents must reason over entire trajectories of state-action pairs to make optimal decisions. A common strategy to address this is through symbolic formalisms, such as Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) or automata, which provide a structured way to express temporally extended objectives. However, these approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions -- such as the availability of a predefined Symbol Grounding (SG) function mapping raw observations to high-level symbolic representations, or prior knowledge of the temporal task. In this work, we propose a fully learnable version of Neural Reward Machines (NRM), which can learn both the SG function and the automaton end-to-end, removing any reliance on prior knowledge. Our approach is therefore as easily applicable as classic deep RL (DRL) approaches, while being far more explainable, because of the finite and compact nature of automata. Furthermore, we show that by integrating Fully Learnable Reward Machines (FLNRM) with DRL, our method outperforms previous approaches based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).</p></details> |  |

Existing attempts typically employ reasoning chains at a coarse-grained level, which struggles to perform fine-grained structured reasoning and, more importantly, are difficult to evaluate the reward and quality of intermediate reasoning. In this work, we delve into chain of step reasoning for vision-language models, enabling assessing reasoning step quality accurately and leading to effective reinforcement learning and inference-time scaling with fine-grained rewards. We present a simple, effective, and fully transparent framework, including the step-level reasoning data, process reward model (PRM), and reinforcement learning training. With the proposed approaches, our models set strong baselines with consistent improvements on challenging vision-language benchmarks. More importantly, we conduct a thorough empirical analysis and ablation study, unveiling the impact of each component and several intriguing properties of inference-time scaling. We believe this paper serves as a baseline for vision-language models and offers insights into more complex multimodal reasoning.

To address the issues of distributed decisions in cloud-edge environments, we present TD3-Sched, a distributed reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduler based on Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) for continuous control of CPU and memory allocation, which can achieve optimized decisions for resource provisioning under dynamic workloads. On a realistic cloud-edge testbed with SockShop application and Alibaba traces, TD3-Sched achieves reductions of 17.9% to 38.6% in latency under same loads compared with other reinforcement-learning and rule-based baselines, and 16% to 31.6% under high loads. TD3-Sched also shows superior Service Level Objective (SLO) compliance with only 0.47% violations. These results indicate faster convergence, lower latency, and more stable performance while preserving service quality in container-based cloud-edge environment compared with the baselines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Tackling GNARLy Problems: Graph Neural Algorithmic Reasoning Reimagined through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18930v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a paradigm that trains neural networks to execute classic algorithms by supervised learning. Despite its successes, important limitations remain: inability to construct valid solutions without post-processing and to reason about multiple correct ones, poor performance on combinatorial NP-hard problems, and inapplicability to problems for which strong algorithms are not yet known. To address these limitations, we reframe the problem of learning algorithm trajectories as a Markov Decision Process, which imposes structure on the solution construction procedure and unlocks the powerful tools of imitation and reinforcement learning (RL). We propose the GNARL framework, encompassing the methodology to translate problem formulations from NAR to RL and a learning architecture suitable for a wide range of graph-based problems. We achieve very high graph accuracy results on several CLRS-30 problems, performance matching or exceeding much narrower NAR approaches for NP-hard problems and, remarkably, applicability even when lacking an expert algorithm.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce an approach for enabling legged mobile manipulators to play badminton, a task that requires precise coordination of perception, locomotion, and arm swinging. We propose a unified reinforcement learning-based control policy for whole-body visuomotor skills involving all degrees of freedom to achieve effective shuttlecock tracking and striking. This policy is informed by a perception noise model that utilizes real-world camera data, allowing for consistent perception error levels between simulation and deployment and encouraging learned active perception behaviors. Our method includes a shuttlecock prediction model, constrained reinforcement learning for robust motion control, and integrated system identification techniques to enhance deployment readiness. Extensive experimental results in a variety of environments validate the robot's capability to predict shuttlecock trajectories, navigate the service area effectively, and execute precise strikes against human players, demonstrating the feasibility of using legged mobile manipulators in complex and dynamic sports scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Scien...</summary><p>Science Robotics DOI: 10.1126/scirobotics.adu3922</p></details> |
| **[Attack for Defense: Adversarial Agents for Point Prompt Optimization Empowering Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18891v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompt quality plays a critical role in the performance of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), yet existing approaches often rely on heuristic or manually crafted prompts, limiting scalability and generalization. In this paper, we propose Point Prompt Defender, an adversarial reinforcement learning framework that adopts an attack-for-defense paradigm to automatically optimize point prompts. We construct a task-agnostic point prompt environment by representing image patches as nodes in a dual-space graph, where edges encode both physical and semantic distances. Within this environment, an attacker agent learns to activate a subset of prompts that maximally degrade SAM's segmentation performance, while a defender agent learns to suppress these disruptive prompts and restore accuracy. Both agents are trained using Deep Q-Networks with a reward signal based on segmentation quality variation. During inference, only the defender is deployed to refine arbitrary coarse prompt sets, enabling enhanced SAM segmentation performance across diverse tasks without retraining. Extensive experiments show that Point Prompt Defender effectively improves SAM's robustness and generalization, establishing a flexible, interpretable, and plug-and-play framework for prompt-based segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongCat-Flash-Thinking Technical Report](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18883v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.</p></details> |  |
| **[WavReward: Spoken Dialogue Models With Generalist Reward Evaluators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09558v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 53.4$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavReward after the paper is accepted.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAPO: Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18849v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning for foundation models, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), have significantly improved the performance of foundation models on reasoning tasks. Notably, the advantage function serves as a central mechanism in GRPO for ranking the trajectory importance. However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failure Makes the Agent Stronger: Enhancing Accuracy through Structured Reflection for Reliable Tool Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18847v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are usually trained with supervised imitation or coarse-grained reinforcement learning that optimizes single tool calls. Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.</p></details> | 9pages |

Replicating these tactile sensing capabilities for dexterous robotic manipulation systems remains a longstanding challenge. In this work, we take a step towards this goal by introducing DexSkin. DexSkin is a soft, conformable capacitive electronic skin that enables sensitive, localized, and calibratable tactile sensing, and can be tailored to varying geometries. We demonstrate its efficacy for learning downstream robotic manipulation by sensorizing a pair of parallel jaw gripper fingers, providing tactile coverage across almost the entire finger surfaces. We empirically evaluate DexSkin's capabilities in learning challenging manipulation tasks that require sensing coverage across the entire surface of the fingers, such as reorienting objects in hand and wrapping elastic bands around boxes, in a learning-from-demonstration framework. We then show that, critically for data-driven approaches, DexSkin can be calibrated to enable model transfer across sensor instances, and demonstrate its applicability to online reinforcement learning on real robots. Our results highlight DexSkin's suitability and practicality for learning real-world, contact-rich manipulation.

| **[On the Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18822v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy mirror descent (PMD) is a general policy optimization framework in reinforcement learning, which can cover a wide range of typical policy optimization methods by specifying different mirror maps. Existing analysis of PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation (TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD (i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate $\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present a framework that leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline. Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Food Image Segmentation using Vision Transformers and Segment Anything Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19028v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised semantic segmentation approach for food images which takes advantage of the zero-shot capabilities and promptability of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) along with the attention mechanisms of Vision Transformers (ViTs). Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 20th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization</p></details> |

Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels, while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively. Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with 4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such as point-of-care devices. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/SLDGroup/MK-UNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 3 figures, Accepted at ICCV 2025 Workshop CVAMD</p></details> |

| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> |
| **[Conformal In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy: Efficient Estimation of Segmentation Quality with Statistical Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04522v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the quality of automatic image segmentation is crucial in clinical practice, but often very challenging due to the limited availability of ground truth annotations. Reverse Classification Accuracy (RCA) is an approach that estimates the quality of new predictions on unseen samples by training a segmenter on those predictions, and then evaluating it against existing annotated images. In this work, we introduce Conformal In-Context RCA, a novel method for automatically estimating segmentation quality with statistical guarantees in the absence of ground-truth annotations, which consists of two main innovations. First, In-Context RCA, which leverages recent in-context learning models for image segmentation and incorporates retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images. This approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data while avoiding the need of training additional models. Second, we introduce Conformal RCA, which extends both the original RCA framework and In-Context RCA to go beyond point estimation. Using tools from split conformal prediction, Conformal RCA produces prediction intervals for segmentation quality providing statistical guarantees that the true score lies within the estimated interval with a user-specified probability. Validated across 10 different medical imaging tasks in various organs and modalities, our methods demonstrate robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential. The code is available at https://github.com/mcosarinsky/Conformal-In-Context-RCA.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic Segmentation Algorithm for Pleural Effusion Based on DBIF-AUNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06191v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness. Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing deep networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by 1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages , 11 figures</p></details> |

We developed a multimodal educational approach for students and trainees during the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Lighthouse Challenge 2025, a landmark initiative to develop accurate brain tumor segmentation algorithms. Fifty-six medical students & radiology trainees volunteered to annotate brain tumor MR images for the BraTS challenges of 2023 & 2024, guided by faculty-led didactics on neuropathology MRI. Among the 56 annotators, 14 select volunteers were then paired with neuroradiology faculty for guided one-on-one annotation sessions for BraTS 2025. Lectures on neuroanatomy, pathology & AI, journal clubs & data scientist-led workshops were organized online. Annotators & audience members completed surveys on their perceived knowledge before & after annotations & lectures respectively. Fourteen coordinators, each paired with a neuroradiologist, completed the data annotation process, averaging 1322.9+/-760.7 hours per dataset per pair and 1200 segmentations in total. On a scale of 1-10, annotation coordinators reported significant increase in familiarity with image segmentation software pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6+/-2.9 to final average of 8.9+/-1.1, and significant increase in familiarity with brain tumor features pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6.2+/-2.4 to final average of 8.1+/-1.2.

| **[DescriptorMedSAM: Language-Image Fusion with Multi-Aspect Text Guidance for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13806v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate organ segmentation is essential for clinical tasks such as radiotherapy planning and disease monitoring. Recent foundation models like MedSAM achieve strong results using point or bounding-box prompts but still require manual interaction. We propose DescriptorMedSAM, a lightweight extension of MedSAM that incorporates structured text prompts, ranging from simple organ names to combined shape and location descriptors to enable click-free segmentation. DescriptorMedSAM employs a CLIP text encoder to convert radiology-style descriptors into dense embeddings, which are fused with visual tokens via a cross-attention block and a multi-scale feature extractor. We designed four descriptor types: Name (N), Name + Shape (NS), Name + Location (NL), and Name + Shape + Location (NSL), and evaluated them on the FLARE 2022 dataset under zero-shot and few-shot settings, where organs unseen during training must be segmented with minimal additional data. NSL prompts achieved the highest performance, with a Dice score of 0.9405 under full supervision, a 76.31% zero-shot retention ratio, and a 97.02% retention ratio after fine-tuning with only 50 labeled slices per unseen organ. Adding shape and location cues consistently improved segmentation accuracy, especially for small or morphologically complex structures. We demonstrate that structured language prompts can effectively replace spatial interactions, delivering strong zero-shot performance and rapid few-shot adaptation. By quantifying the role of descriptor, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, prompt-aware segmentation models that generalize across diverse anatomical targets with minimal annotation effort.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

| **[BiPrompt-SAM: Enhancing Image Segmentation via Explicit Selection between Point and Text Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19769v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at point-prompted segmentation, while text-based models, often leveraging powerful multimodal encoders like BEIT-3, provide rich semantic understanding. However, effectively combining these complementary modalities remains a challenge. This paper introduces BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework employing an explicit selection mechanism. We leverage SAM's ability to generate multiple mask candidates from a single point prompt and use a text-guided mask (generated via EVF-SAM with BEIT-3) to select the point-generated mask that best aligns spatially, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU). This approach, interpretable as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE), effectively fuses spatial precision and semantic context without complex model modifications. Notably, our method achieves strong zero-shot performance on the Endovis17 medical dataset (89.55% mDice, 81.46% mIoU) using only a single point prompt per instance. This significantly reduces annotation burden compared to bounding boxes and aligns better with practical clinical workflows, demonstrating the method's effectiveness without domain-specific training. On the RefCOCO series, BiPrompt-SAM attained 87.1%, 86.5%, and 85.8% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Experiments show BiPrompt-SAM excels in scenarios requiring both spatial accuracy and semantic disambiguation, offering a simple, effective, and interpretable perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p></details> | metrics went wrong |
| **[SAM2-ELNet: Label Enhancement and Automatic Annotation for Remote Sensing Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12404v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing image segmentation is crucial for environmental monitoring, disaster assessment, and resource management, but its performance largely depends on the quality of the dataset. Although several high-quality datasets are broadly accessible, data scarcity remains for specialized tasks like marine oil spill segmentation. Such tasks still rely on manual annotation, which is both time-consuming and influenced by subjective human factors. The segment anything model 2 (SAM2) has strong potential as an automatic annotation framework but struggles to perform effectively on heterogeneous, low-contrast remote sensing imagery. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel label enhancement and automatic annotation framework, termed SAM2-ELNet (Enhancement and Labeling Network). Specifically, we employ the frozen Hiera backbone from the pretrained SAM2 as the encoder, while fine-tuning the adapter and decoder for different remote sensing tasks. In addition, the proposed framework includes a label quality evaluator for filtering, ensuring the reliability of the generated labels. We design a series of experiments targeting resource-limited remote sensing tasks and evaluate our method on two datasets: the Deep-SAR Oil Spill (SOS) dataset with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery, and the CHN6-CUG Road dataset with Very High Resolution (VHR) optical imagery. The proposed framework can enhance coarse annotations and generate reliable training data under resource-limited conditions. Fine-tuned on only 30% of the training data, it generates automatically labeled data. A model trained solely on these achieves slightly lower performance than using the full original annotations, while greatly reducing labeling costs and offering a practical solution for large-scale remote sensing interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing</p></details> |

When these satellites reflect sunlight, they produce streak-like artifacts in photometry images. Such satellite trails can introduce false sources and cause significant photometric errors. As a result, accurately identifying the positions of satellite trails in observational data has become essential. In this work, we propose a satellite trail detection model that combines the U-Net deep neural network for image segmentation with the Line Segment Detector (LSD) algorithm. The model is trained on 375 simulated images of satellite trails, generated using data from the Mini-SiTian Array. Experimental results show that for trails with a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3, the detection rate exceeds 99. Additionally, when applied to real observational data from the Mini-SiTian Array, the model achieves a recall of 79.57 and a precision of 74.56.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, PASP accepted</p></details> |

This work presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function. Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L) evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on 48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5 gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the original Otsu method.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 tables |

While existing methods address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input, feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation.

ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training. ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of 2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol), surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.</p></details> |  |

The technique utilizes image segmentation methods to identify fixed regions for calculating feature importance scores as explanations. Therefore, poor segmentation can weaken the explanation and reduce the importance of segments, ultimately affecting the overall clarity of interpretation. To address these challenges, we introduce the DSEG-LIME (Data-Driven Segmentation LIME) framework, featuring: i) a data-driven segmentation for human-recognized feature generation by foundation model integration, and ii) a user-steered granularity in the hierarchical segmentation procedure through composition. Our findings demonstrate that DSEG outperforms on several XAI metrics on pre-trained ImageNet models and improves the alignment of explanations with human-recognized concepts.

Federated learning addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities; however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts) component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization. Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.</p></details> | 5 pages |

While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

We focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its adaptability as more advanced models emerge.

| **[Enhancing Feature Fusion of U-like Networks with Dynamic Skip Connections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14610v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>U-like networks have become fundamental frameworks in medical image segmentation through skip connections that bridge high-level semantics and low-level spatial details. Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.</p></details> |  |

However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs. Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer. Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. The key novelties of MEGANet-W include a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi-orientation edge extraction; and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (W-EGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters.

Furthermore, to eliminate manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss.

However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity, often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops. Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens, our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual projectors on RIS.</p></details> |  |

When left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12 and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted colorectal screening.</p></details> |  |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci- dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses.

Their success relies on 3D vision systems that effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation, and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data, producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail.</p></details> |  |
| **[REACT: Real-time Efficiency and Accuracy Compromise for Tradeoffs in Scene Graph Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16116v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scene Graph Generation (SGG) is a task that encodes visual relationships between objects in images as graph structures. SGG shows significant promise as a foundational component for downstream tasks, such as reasoning for embodied agents. To enable real-time applications, SGG must address the trade-off between performance and inference speed. However, current methods tend to focus on one of the following: (1) improving relation prediction accuracy, (2) enhancing object detection accuracy, or (3) reducing latency, without aiming to balance all three objectives simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose the Real-time Efficiency and Accuracy Compromise for Tradeoffs in Scene Graph Generation (REACT) architecture, which achieves the highest inference speed among existing SGG models, improving object detection accuracy without sacrificing relation prediction performance.

| **[HyPSAM: Hybrid Prompt-driven Segment Anything Model for RGB-Thermal Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18738v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-thermal salient object detection (RGB-T SOD) aims to identify prominent objects by integrating complementary information from RGB and thermal modalities. However, learning the precise boundaries and complete objects remains challenging due to the intrinsic insufficient feature fusion and the extrinsic limitations of data scarcity. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid prompt-driven segment anything model (HyPSAM), which leverages the zero-shot generalization capabilities of the segment anything model (SAM) for RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we first propose a dynamic fusion network (DFNet) that generates high-quality initial saliency maps as visual prompts. DFNet employs dynamic convolution and multi-branch decoding to facilitate adaptive cross-modality interaction, overcoming the limitations of fixed-parameter kernels and enhancing multi-modal feature representation. Moreover, we propose a plug-and-play refinement network (P2RNet), which serves as a general optimization strategy to guide SAM in refining saliency maps by using hybrid prompts. The text prompt ensures reliable modality input, while the mask and box prompts enable precise salient object localization. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. Notably, HyPSAM has remarkable versatility, seamlessly integrating with different RGB-T SOD methods to achieve significant performance gains, thereby highlighting the potential of prompt engineering in this field. The code and results of our method are available at: https://github.com/milotic233/HyPSAM.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly rely on CNNs, limited by the local receptive fields, or Vision Transformers that suffer from the cost of quadratic complexity, posing a challenge in balancing performance and computational efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSM), Mamba, have shown great potential for modeling long-range dependency with linear complexity. However, directly applying SSM to RGB-D SOD may lead to deficient local semantics as well as the inadequate cross-modality fusion. To address these issues, we propose a Local Emphatic and Adaptive Fusion state space model (LEAF-Mamba) that contains two novel components: 1) a local emphatic state space module (LE-SSM) to capture multi-scale local dependencies for both modalities. 2) an SSM-based adaptive fusion module (AFM) for complementary cross-modality interaction and reliable cross-modality integration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LEAF-Mamba consistently outperforms 16 state-of-the-art RGB-D SOD methods in both efficacy and efficiency. Moreover, our method can achieve excellent performance on the RGB-T SOD task, proving a powerful generalization ability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM MM 2025</p></details> |

Existing assistive technologies present a trade-off: systems that offer precise guidance typically require pre-scanning or support only fixed object categories, while those with open-world object recognition lack spatial feedback for reaching the object. To address this gap, we introduce 'NaviSense', a mobile assistive system that combines conversational AI, vision-language models, augmented reality (AR), and LiDAR to support open-world object detection with real-time audio-haptic guidance. Users specify objects via natural language and receive continuous spatial feedback to navigate toward the target without needing prior setup. Designed with insights from a formative study and evaluated with 12 blind and low-vision participants, NaviSense significantly reduced object retrieval time and was preferred over existing tools, demonstrating the value of integrating open-world perception with precise, accessible guidance.</p></details> |  |

Built upon a multi-modal large language model foundation like Gemini, EMMA directly maps raw camera sensor data into various driving-specific outputs, including planner trajectories, perception objects, and road graph elements. EMMA maximizes the utility of world knowledge from the pre-trained large language models, by representing all non-sensor inputs (e.g. navigation instructions and ego vehicle status) and outputs (e.g. trajectories and 3D locations) as natural language text. This approach allows EMMA to jointly process various driving tasks in a unified language space, and generate the outputs for each task using task-specific prompts. Empirically, we demonstrate EMMA's effectiveness by achieving state-of-the-art performance in motion planning on nuScenes as well as competitive results on the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD). EMMA also yields competitive results for camera-primary 3D object detection on the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD). We show that co-training EMMA with planner trajectories, object detection, and road graph tasks yields improvements across all three domains, highlighting EMMA's potential as a generalist model for autonomous driving applications. We hope that our results will inspire research to further evolve the state of the art in autonomous driving model architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMLR.

Nevertheless, its point clouds exhibit significant sparsity and noise, restricting its standalone application in 3D object detection. Recent 4D radar-camera fusion methods have provided effective perception. Most existing approaches, however, adopt explicit Bird's-Eye-View fusion paradigms originally designed for LiDAR-camera fusion, neglecting radar's inherent drawbacks. Specifically, they overlook the sparse and incomplete geometry of radar point clouds and restrict fusion to coarse scene-level integration. To address these problems, we propose MLF-4DRCNet, a novel two-stage framework for 3D object detection via multi-level fusion of 4D radar and camera images. Our model incorporates the point-, scene-, and proposal-level multi-modal information, enabling comprehensive feature representation. It comprises three crucial components: the Enhanced Radar Point Encoder (ERPE) module, the Hierarchical Scene Fusion Pooling (HSFP) module, and the Proposal-Level Fusion Enhancement (PLFE) module. Operating at the point-level, ERPE densities radar point clouds with 2D image instances and encodes them into voxels via the proposed Triple-Attention Voxel Feature Encoder. HSFP dynamically integrates multi-scale voxel features with 2D image features using deformable attention to capture scene context and adopts pooling to the fused features. PLFE refines region proposals by fusing image features, and further integrates with the pooled features from HSFP. Experimental results on the View-of-Delft (VoD) and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that MLF-4DRCNet achieves the state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it attains performance comparable to LiDAR-based models on the VoD dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Check Field Detection Agent (CFD-Agent) using Multimodal Large Language and Vision Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18405v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Checks remain a foundational instrument in the financial ecosystem, facilitating substantial transaction volumes across institutions. However, their continued use also renders them a persistent target for fraud, underscoring the importance of robust check fraud detection mechanisms. At the core of such systems lies the accurate identification and localization of critical fields, such as the signature, magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) line, courtesy amount, legal amount, payee, and payer, which are essential for subsequent verification against reference checks belonging to the same customer. This field-level detection is traditionally dependent on object detection models trained on large, diverse, and meticulously labeled datasets, a resource that is scarce due to proprietary and privacy concerns. In this paper, we introduce a novel, training-free framework for automated check field detection, leveraging the power of a vision language model (VLM) in conjunction with a multimodal large language model (MLLM). Our approach enables zero-shot detection of check components, significantly lowering the barrier to deployment in real-world financial settings. Quantitative evaluation of our model on a hand-curated dataset of 110 checks spanning multiple formats and layouts demonstrates strong performance and generalization capability. Furthermore, this framework can serve as a bootstrap mechanism for generating high-quality labeled datasets, enabling the development of specialized real-time object detection models tailored to institutional needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

We introduce a training-free pipeline that invokes OWLv2 only on fixed-interval keyframes and propagates detections to intermediate frames using compressed-domain motion vectors (MV). A simple 3x3 grid aggregation of motion vectors provides translation and uniform-scale updates, augmented with an area-growth check and an optional single-class switch. The method requires no labels, no fine-tuning, and uses the same prompt list for all open-vocabulary methods. On ILSVRC2015-VID (validation dataset), our approach (MVP) attains mAP@0.5=0.609 and mAP@[0.5:0.95]=0.316. At loose intersection-over-union (IoU) thresholds it remains close to framewise OWLv2-Large (0.747/0.721 at 0.2/0.3 versus 0.784/0.780), reflecting that coarse localization is largely preserved. Under the same keyframe schedule, MVP outperforms tracker-based propagation (MOSSE, KCF, CSRT) at mAP@0.5. A supervised reference (YOLOv12x) reaches 0.631 at mAP@0.5 but requires labeled training, whereas our method remains label-free and open-vocabulary. These results indicate that compressed-domain propagation is a practical way to reduce detector invocations while keeping strong zero-shot coverage in videos.

Recent works have focused on employing temporal fusion and Knowledge Distillation (KD) strategies to overcome these limitations. However, existing approaches have not sufficiently accounted for uncertainties arising from object motion or sensor-specific errors inherent in radar and camera modalities. In this work, we propose RCTDistill, a novel cross-modal KD method based on temporal fusion, comprising three key modules: Range-Azimuth Knowledge Distillation (RAKD), Temporal Knowledge Distillation (TKD), and Region-Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (RDKD). RAKD is designed to consider the inherent errors in the range and azimuth directions, enabling effective knowledge transfer from LiDAR features to refine inaccurate BEV representations. TKD mitigates temporal misalignment caused by dynamic objects by aligning historical radar-camera BEV features with current LiDAR representations. RDKD enhances feature discrimination by distilling relational knowledge from the teacher model, allowing the student to differentiate foreground and background features. RCTDistill achieves state-of-the-art radar-camera fusion performance on both the nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD) datasets, with the fastest inference speed of 26.2 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Current deep learning models for Object Detection in space applications are often trained on synthetic data from simulators, however, the model performance drops significantly on real-world data due to the domain gap. However, domain adaptive object detection is an overlooked problem in the community. In this work, we first show the importance of domain adaptation and then explore Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) to reduce this gap using minimal labeled real data. We build on a recent semi-supervised adaptation method and tailor it for object detection. Our approach combines domain-invariant feature learning with a CNN-based domain discriminator and invariant risk minimization using a domain-independent regression head. To meet real-time deployment needs, we test our method on a lightweight Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet backbone and on the more advanced Fully Convolutional One-Stage object detector (FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone. We evaluated on two space datasets, SPEED+ and SPARK. The results show up to 20-point improvements in average precision (AP) with just 250 labeled real images.</p></details> | <details><summary>Advan...</summary><p>Advanced Space Technologies in Robotics and Automation (ASTRA) 2025</p></details> |

While YOLO models have become the backbone of real-time object detection, little work has systematically examined their robustness under these uniquely challenging conditions. This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust when operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater environments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive evaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated underwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images from DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also analyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges, and color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall performance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and texture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images. Class imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3) image counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance, while object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we evaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection, which improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and fine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced domains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong potential for domain adaptation, respectively. Together, these insights provide practical guidance for building resilient and cost-efficient UOD systems.</p></details> | 28 Pages, 12 Figures |

While this approach can improve learning efficiency, it may also cause performance degradation due to task conflicts that arise when optimizing the model for different objectives. To address this challenge, we introduce MAESTRO, a structured framework designed to generate task-specific features and mitigate feature interference in multi-task 3D perception, including 3D object detection, bird's-eye view (BEV) map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction. MAESTRO comprises three components: the Class-wise Prototype Generator (CPG), the Task-Specific Feature Generator (TSFG), and the Scene Prototype Aggregator (SPA). CPG groups class categories into foreground and background groups and generates group-wise prototypes. The foreground and background prototypes are assigned to the 3D object detection task and the map segmentation task, respectively, while both are assigned to the 3D occupancy prediction task. TSFG leverages these prototype groups to retain task-relevant features while suppressing irrelevant features, thereby enhancing the performance for each task. SPA enhances the prototype groups assigned for 3D occupancy prediction by utilizing the information produced by the 3D object detection head and the map segmentation head. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate that MAESTRO consistently outperforms existing methods across 3D object detection, BEV map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Traditional fish detection methods are time-consuming and demand expert knowledge, prompting the need for automated solutions. This study explores the implementation of YOLOv10-nano, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, for real-time marine fish detection in Indonesian waters, using test data from Bunaken National Marine Park. YOLOv10's architecture, featuring improvements like the CSPNet backbone, PAN for feature fusion, and Pyramid Spatial Attention Block, enables efficient and accurate object detection even in complex environments. The model was evaluated on the DeepFish and OpenImages V7-Fish datasets. Results show that YOLOv10-nano achieves a high detection accuracy with mAP50 of 0.966 and mAP50:95 of 0.606 while maintaining low computational demand (2.7M parameters, 8.4 GFLOPs). It also delivered an average inference speed of 29.29 FPS on the CPU, making it suitable for real-time deployment. Although OpenImages V7-Fish alone provided lower accuracy, it complemented DeepFish in enhancing model robustness. Overall, this study demonstrates YOLOv10-nano's potential for efficient, scalable marine fish monitoring and conservation applications in data-limited environments.</p></details> |  |

However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@50 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception.

Although existing Dense Pseudo-Label methods have demonstrated substantial potential in pseudo-labeling tasks, they remain constrained by selection ambiguities and inconsistencies in confidence estimation.In this paper, we introduce an LLM-assisted semantic guidance framework tailored for sparsely annotated remote sensing object detection, exploiting the advanced semantic reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to distill high-confidence pseudo-labels.By integrating LLM-generated semantic priors, we propose a Class-Aware Dense Pseudo-Label Assignment mechanism that adaptively assigns pseudo-labels for both unlabeled and sparsely labeled data, ensuring robust supervision across varying data distributions. Additionally, we develop an Adaptive Hard-Negative Reweighting Module to stabilize the supervised learning branch by mitigating the influence of confounding background information. Extensive experiments on DOTA and HRSC2016 demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing single-stage detector-based frameworks, significantly improving detection performance under sparse annotations.</p></details> |  |

Although existing methods have improved detection accuracy through complex network architectures, their high computational complexity and memory consumption severely restrict their performance. Motivated by the success of large kernel convolutions in remote sensing, we propose MO R-CNN, a lightweight framework for multi-spectral oriented detection featuring heterogeneous feature extraction network (HFEN), single modality supervision (SMS), and condition-based multimodal label fusion (CMLF). HFEN leverages inter-modal differences to adaptively align, merge, and enhance multi-modal features. SMS constrains multi-scale features and enables the model to learn from multiple modalities. CMLF fuses multimodal labels based on specific rules, providing the model with a more robust and consistent supervisory signal. Experiments on the DroneVehicle, VEDAI and OGSOD datasets prove the superiority of our method. The source code is available at:https://github.com/Iwill-github/MORCNN.</p></details> |  |

It provides control over various environmental parameters, enabling thorough evaluation. Development bounding boxes are commonly utilized tools in deep learning and play a crucial role in AD applications. The predominant method for data generation in the CARLA Simulator involves identifying and delineating objects of interest, such as vehicles, using bounding boxes. The operation in CARLA entails capturing the coordinates of all objects on the map, which are subsequently aligned with the sensor's coordinate system at the ego vehicle and then enclosed within bounding boxes relative to the ego vehicle's perspective. However, this primary approach encounters challenges associated with object detection and bounding box annotation, such as ghost boxes. Although these procedures are generally effective at detecting vehicles and other objects within their direct line of sight, they may also produce false positives by identifying objects that are obscured by obstructions. We have enhanced the primary approach with the objective of filtering out unwanted boxes. Performance analysis indicates that the improved approach has achieved high accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 12 figures,VEHITS Conference 2024</p></details> |

This task is crucial for applications like human-robot interaction where textual input is impractical. However, progress in this domain faces a fundamental bottleneck from the scarcity of large-scale, paired audio-image data, and is further constrained by previous methods that rely on indirect, text-mediated pipelines. In this paper, we introduce Speech-to-See (Speech2See), an end-to-end approach built on a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we design a Query-Guided Semantic Aggregation module that employs learnable queries to condense redundant speech embeddings into compact semantic representations. During fine-tuning, we incorporate a parameter-efficient Mixture-of-LoRA-Experts (MoLE) architecture to achieve deeper and more nuanced cross-modal adaptation. Extensive experiments show that Speech2See achieves robust and adaptable performance across multiple benchmarks, demonstrating its strong generalization ability and broad applicability.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present VisText-Mosquito, a multimodal dataset that integrates visual and textual data to support automated detection, segmentation, and reasoning for mosquito breeding site analysis. The dataset includes 1,828 annotated images for object detection, 142 images for water surface segmentation, and natural language reasoning texts linked to each image. The YOLOv9s model achieves the highest precision of 0.92926 and mAP@50 of 0.92891 for object detection, while YOLOv11n-Seg reaches a segmentation precision of 0.91587 and mAP@50 of 0.79795. For reasoning generation, we tested a range of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in both zero-shot and few-shot settings.

In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3 mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[Investigating Long-term Training for Remote Sensing Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15143v3)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, numerous methods have achieved impressive performance in remote sensing object detection, relying on convolution or transformer architectures. Such detectors typically have a feature backbone to extract useful features from raw input images. A common practice in current detectors is initializing the backbone with pre-trained weights available online. Fine-tuning the backbone is typically required to generate features suitable for remote-sensing images. While the prolonged training could lead to over-fitting, hindering the extraction of basic visual features, it can enable models to gradually extract deeper insights and richer representations from remote sensing data. Striking a balance between these competing factors is critical for achieving optimal performance. In this study, we aim to investigate the performance and characteristics of remote sensing object detection models under very long training schedules, and propose a novel method named Dynamic Backbone Freezing (DBF) for feature backbone fine-tuning on remote sensing object detection under long-term training. Our method addresses the dilemma of whether the backbone should extract low-level generic features or possess specific knowledge of the remote sensing domain, by introducing a module called 'Freezing Scheduler' to manage the update of backbone features during long-term training dynamically. Extensive experiments on DOTA and DIOR-R show that our approach enables more accurate model learning while substantially reducing computational costs in long-term training. Besides, it can be seamlessly adopted without additional effort due to its straightforward design. The code is available at https://github.com/unique-chan/dbf.</p></details> |  |

It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection: given an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of roughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the dataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the pages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up more than 25% of the dataset. In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors, FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative analysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature fields.

We identify and quantify this critical issue, demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes, RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%, narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for AD development.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Our approach enables a mobile robot to build, revisit, and update a hybrid semantic map that integrates a 2D occupancy grid for geometry with a topological graph for object semantics. Unlike prior methods that rely on manual teleoperation or precollected datasets, our two-phase approach achieves end-to-end autonomy: first, a modified frontier-based exploration algorithm with dynamic search windows constructs a geometric map; second, using a greedy trajectory planner, environments are revisited, and object semantics are updated using open-vocabulary object detection and segmentation. This modular system, compatible with any metric SLAM framework, supports continuous operation by efficiently updating the semantic graph to reflect short-term and long-term changes such as object relocation, removal, or addition. We validate the approach on a Fetch robot in real-world indoor environments of approximately $8,500$m$^2$ and $117$m$^2$, demonstrating robust and scalable semantic mapping and continuous adaptation, marking a fully autonomous integration of exploration, mapping, and semantic updating on a physical robot.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables.

| **[LED: LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection without Human Curated Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13794v6)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large foundation models trained on large-scale vision-language data can boost Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) via synthetic training data, yet the hand-crafted pipelines often introduce bias and overfit to specific prompts. We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.</p></details> |  |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of acci- dents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in acci- dent identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi- object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

| **[An Analysis of Kalman Filter based Object Tracking Methods for Fast-Moving Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18451v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.</p></details> |  |

While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSEv2: A More Challenging Dataset for Video Object Segmentation in Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05630v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the foundations and insights of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces much greater scene complexity, including {more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and scenarios requiring external knowledge.} We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops on MOSEv2. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and observe similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 poses challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite strong performance on existing datasets, current VOS methods still fall short under real-world complexities. Based on our analysis of the observed challenges, we further propose several practical tricks that enhance model performance.

Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy, stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author requires to do so</p></details> |

LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on Github: https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM</p></details> |

The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page Journal paper, accepted by IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy</p></details> |

While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters.

However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion.

Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted at CVPR animal workshop 2024, submitted to IJCV</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

| **[Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.</p></details> |  |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments.

| **[Hyperspectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08265v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images, which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.</p></details> |  |

In addition, we extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depthwise-Dilated Convolutional Adapters for Medical Object Tracking and Segmentation Using the Segment Anything Model 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14613v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods.

We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA. Given offline detections, our algorithm tracks at 250+ fps on a single laptop CPU. Code is available at https://github.com/hwcao17/pkf.</p></details> |  |

We identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2) overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging scenarios.

Unlike existing multimodal diffsion language models such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O exhibits many new capabilities such as object grounding, image-editing, and high-resolution (1024px) image synthesis. It is also the first unified MDM that uses its understanding capabilities to improve image generation and editing results through planning and iterative self-reflection. To allow effective and efficient training and sampling, Lavida-O ntroduces many novel techniques such as Elastic Mixture-of-Transformer architecture, universal text conditioning, and stratified sampling. \ours~achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks such as RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference.</p></details> | 32 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Hyper-Bagel: A Unified Acceleration Framework for Multimodal Understanding and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18824v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models have recently attracted considerable attention for their remarkable abilities in jointly understanding and generating diverse content. However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[Towards Application Aligned Synthetic Surgical Image Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18796v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of annotated surgical data poses a significant challenge for developing deep learning systems in computer-assisted interventions. While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision applications.</p></details> |  |

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding-in-Generation: Reinforcing Generative Capability of Unified Model via Infusing Understanding into Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18639v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

| **[SparseDiT: Token Sparsification for Efficient Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06028v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are renowned for their impressive generative performance; however, they are significantly constrained by considerable computational costs due to the quadratic complexity in self-attention and the extensive sampling steps required. While advancements have been made in expediting the sampling process, the underlying architectural inefficiencies within DiT remain underexplored. We introduce SparseDiT, a novel framework that implements token sparsification across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance computational efficiency while preserving generative quality. Spatially, SparseDiT employs a tri-segment architecture that allocates token density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the bottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token Modules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local detail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details. Temporally, SparseDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising stages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later timesteps. This synergy between SparseDiT spatially adaptive architecture and its temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances efficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate SparseDiT effectiveness, achieving a 55% reduction in FLOPs and a 175% improvement in inference speed on DiT-XL with similar FID score on 512x512 ImageNet, a 56% reduction in FLOPs across video generation datasets, and a 69% improvement in inference speed on PixArt-$\alpha$ on text-to-image generation task with a 0.24 FID score decrease. SparseDiT provides a scalable solution for high-quality diffusion-based generation compatible with sampling optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |

Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025).

| **[Exploring Image Generation via Mutually Exclusive Probability Spaces and Local Correlation Hypothesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21731v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A common assumption in probabilistic generative models for image generation is that learning the global data distribution suffices to generate novel images via sampling. We investigate the limitation of this core assumption, namely that learning global distributions leads to memorization rather than generative behavior. We propose two theoretical frameworks, the Mutually Exclusive Probability Space (MEPS) and the Local Dependence Hypothesis (LDH), for investigation. MEPS arises from the observation that deterministic mappings (e.g. neural networks) involving random variables tend to reduce overlap coefficients among involved random variables, thereby inducing exclusivity. We further propose a lower bound in terms of the overlap coefficient, and introduce a Binary Latent Autoencoder (BL-AE) that encodes images into signed binary latent representations. LDH formalizes dependence within a finite observation radius, which motivates our $\gamma$-Autoregressive Random Variable Model ($\gamma$-ARVM). $\gamma$-ARVM is an autoregressive model, with a variable observation range $\gamma$, that predicts a histogram for the next token. Using $\gamma$-ARVM, we observe that as the observation range increases, autoregressive models progressively shift toward memorization. In the limit of global dependence, the model behaves as a pure memorizer when operating on the binary latents produced by our BL-AE. Comprehensive experiments and discussions support our investigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seg4Diff: Unveiling Open-Vocabulary Segmentation in Text-to-Image Diffusion Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18096v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models excel at translating language prompts into photorealistic images by implicitly grounding textual concepts through their cross-modal attention mechanisms. Recent multi-modal diffusion transformers extend this by introducing joint self-attention over concatenated image and text tokens, enabling richer and more scalable cross-modal alignment. However, a detailed understanding of how and where these attention maps contribute to image generation remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Seg4Diff (Segmentation for Diffusion), a systematic framework for analyzing the attention structures of MM-DiT, with a focus on how specific layers propagate semantic information from text to image. Through comprehensive analysis, we identify a semantic grounding expert layer, a specific MM-DiT block that consistently aligns text tokens with spatially coherent image regions, naturally producing high-quality semantic segmentation masks. We further demonstrate that applying a lightweight fine-tuning scheme with mask-annotated image data enhances the semantic grouping capabilities of these layers and thereby improves both segmentation performance and generated image fidelity. Our findings demonstrate that semantic grouping is an emergent property of diffusion transformers and can be selectively amplified to advance both segmentation and generation performance, paving the way for unified models that bridge visual perception and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.
