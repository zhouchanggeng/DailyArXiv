| **[To Clip or not to Clip: the Dynamics of SGD with Gradient Clipping in High-Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.11733v2)** | 2024-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of modern machine learning is due in part to the adaptive optimization methods that have been developed to deal with the difficulties of training large models over complex datasets. One such method is gradient clipping: a practical procedure with limited theoretical underpinnings. In this work, we study clipping in a least squares problem under streaming SGD. We develop a theoretical analysis of the learning dynamics in the limit of large intrinsic dimension-a model and dataset dependent notion of dimensionality. In this limit we find a deterministic equation that describes the evolution of the loss and demonstrate that this equation predicts the path of clipped SGD on synthetic, CIFAR10, and Wikitext2 data. We show that with Gaussian noise clipping cannot improve SGD performance. Yet, in other noisy settings, clipping can provide benefits with tuning of the clipping threshold. We propose a simple heuristic for near optimal scheduling of the clipping threshold which requires the tuning of only one hyperparameter. We conclude with a discussion about the links between high-dimensional clipping and neural network training.</p></details> |  |
| **[U-Clip: On-Average Unbiased Stochastic Gradient Clipping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.02971v1)** | 2023-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>U-Clip is a simple amendment to gradient clipping that can be applied to any iterative gradient optimization algorithm. Like regular clipping, U-Clip involves using gradients that are clipped to a prescribed size (e.g. with component wise or norm based clipping) but instead of discarding the clipped portion of the gradient, U-Clip maintains a buffer of these values that is added to the gradients on the next iteration (before clipping). We show that the cumulative bias of the U-Clip updates is bounded by a constant. This implies that the clipped updates are unbiased on average. Convergence follows via a lemma that guarantees convergence with updates $u_i$ as long as $\sum_{i=1}^t (u_i - g_i) = o(t)$ where $g_i$ are the gradients. Extensive experimental exploration is performed on CIFAR10 with further validation given on ImageNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVA-CLIP: Improved Training Techniques for CLIP at Scale](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.15389v1)** | 2023-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language-image pre-training, CLIP for short, has gained increasing attention for its potential in various scenarios. In this paper, we propose EVA-CLIP, a series of models that significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of CLIP training. Our approach incorporates new techniques for representation learning, optimization, and augmentation, enabling EVA-CLIP to achieve superior performance compared to previous CLIP models with the same number of parameters but significantly smaller training costs. Notably, our largest 5.0B-parameter EVA-02-CLIP-E/14+ with only 9 billion seen samples achieves 82.0 zero-shot top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K val. A smaller EVA-02-CLIP-L/14+ with only 430 million parameters and 6 billion seen samples achieves 80.4 zero-shot top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K val. To facilitate open access and open research, we release the complete suite of EVA-CLIP to the community at https://github.com/baaivision/EVA/tree/master/EVA-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Re...</summary><p>To Rei and the moon.

| **[FAA-CLIP: Federated Adversarial Adaptation of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.05776v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable performance of vision language models (VLMs) such as Contrastive Language Image Pre-training (CLIP), the large size of these models is a considerable obstacle to their use in federated learning (FL) systems where the parameters of local client models need to be transferred to a global server for aggregation. Another challenge in FL is the heterogeneity of data from different clients, which affects the generalization performance of the solution. In addition, natural pre-trained VLMs exhibit poor generalization ability in the medical datasets, suggests there exists a domain gap. To solve these issues, we introduce a novel method for the Federated Adversarial Adaptation (FAA) of CLIP. Our method, named FAA-CLIP, handles the large communication costs of CLIP using a light-weight feature adaptation module (FAM) for aggregation, effectively adapting this VLM to each client's data while greatly reducing the number of parameters to transfer. By keeping CLIP frozen and only updating the FAM parameters, our method is also computationally efficient. Unlike existing approaches, our FAA-CLIP method directly addresses the problem of domain shifts across clients via a domain adaptation (DA) module. This module employs a domain classifier to predict if a given sample is from the local client or the global server, allowing the model to learn domain-invariant representations. Extensive experiments on six different datasets containing both natural and medical images demonstrate that FAA-CLIP can generalize well on both natural and medical datasets compared to recent FL approaches. Our codes are available at https://github.com/AIPMLab/FAA-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in IEEE Internet of Things Journal</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-KD: An Empirical Study of CLIP Model Distillation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12732v2)** | 2024-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a promising language-supervised visual pre-training framework. This paper aims to distill small CLIP models supervised by a large teacher CLIP model. We propose several distillation strategies, including relation, feature, gradient and contrastive paradigms, to examine the effectiveness of CLIP-Knowledge Distillation (KD). We show that a simple feature mimicry with Mean Squared Error loss works surprisingly well. Moreover, interactive contrastive learning across teacher and student encoders is also effective in performance improvement. We explain that the success of CLIP-KD can be attributed to maximizing the feature similarity between teacher and student. The unified method is applied to distill several student models trained on CC3M+12M. CLIP-KD improves student CLIP models consistently over zero-shot ImageNet classification and cross-modal retrieval benchmarks. When using ViT-L/14 pretrained on Laion-400M as the teacher, CLIP-KD achieves 57.5\% and 55.4\% zero-shot top-1 ImageNet accuracy over ViT-B/16 and ResNet-50, surpassing the original CLIP without KD by 20.5\% and 20.1\% margins, respectively. Our code is released on https://github.com/winycg/CLIP-KD.</p></details> | CVPR-2024 |
| **[EVA-CLIP-18B: Scaling CLIP to 18 Billion Parameters](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.04252v1)** | 2024-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling up contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) is critical for empowering both vision and multimodal models. We present EVA-CLIP-18B, the largest and most powerful open-source CLIP model to date, with 18-billion parameters. With only 6-billion training samples seen, EVA-CLIP-18B achieves an exceptional 80.7% zero-shot top-1 accuracy averaged across 27 widely recognized image classification benchmarks, outperforming its forerunner EVA-CLIP (5-billion parameters) and other open-source CLIP models by a large margin. Remarkably, we observe a consistent performance improvement with the model size scaling of EVA-CLIP, despite maintaining a constant training dataset of 2-billion image-text pairs from LAION-2B and COYO-700M. This dataset is openly available and much smaller than the in-house datasets (e.g., DFN-5B, WebLI-10B) employed in other state-of-the-art CLIP models. EVA-CLIP-18B demonstrates the potential of EVA-style weak-to-strong visual model scaling. With our model weights made publicly available, we hope to facilitate future research in vision and multimodal foundation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-TD: CLIP Targeted Distillation for Vision-Language Tasks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.05729v3)** | 2023-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) links vision and language modalities into a unified embedding space, yielding the tremendous potential for vision-language (VL) tasks. While early concurrent works have begun to study this potential on a subset of tasks, important questions remain: 1) What is the benefit of CLIP on unstudied VL tasks? 2) Does CLIP provide benefit in low-shot or domain-shifted scenarios? 3) Can CLIP improve existing approaches without impacting inference or pretraining complexity? In this work, we seek to answer these questions through two key contributions. First, we introduce an evaluation protocol that includes Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR), Visual Entailment (SNLI-VE), and Visual Question Answering (VQA), across a variety of data availability constraints and conditions of domain shift. Second, we propose an approach, named CLIP Targeted Distillation (CLIP-TD), to intelligently distill knowledge from CLIP into existing architectures using a dynamically weighted objective applied to adaptively selected tokens per instance. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed CLIP-TD leads to exceptional gains in the low-shot (up to 51.9%) and domain-shifted (up to 71.3%) conditions of VCR, while simultaneously improving performance under standard fully-supervised conditions (up to 2%), achieving state-of-art performance on VCR compared to other single models that are pretrained with image-text data only. On SNLI-VE, CLIP-TD produces significant gains in low-shot conditions (up to 6.6%) as well as fully supervised (up to 3%). On VQA, CLIP-TD provides improvement in low-shot (up to 9%), and in fully-supervised (up to 1.3%). Finally, CLIP-TD outperforms concurrent works utilizing CLIP for finetuning, as well as baseline naive distillation approaches. Code will be made available.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is greatly modified and updated to be re-submitted to another conference.

| **[Robotic-CLIP: Fine-tuning CLIP on Action Data for Robotic Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17727v1)** | 2024-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models have played a key role in extracting meaningful features for various robotic applications. Among these, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is widely used in robotic tasks that require both vision and natural language understanding. However, CLIP was trained solely on static images paired with text prompts and has not yet been fully adapted for robotic tasks involving dynamic actions. In this paper, we introduce Robotic-CLIP to enhance robotic perception capabilities. We first gather and label large-scale action data, and then build our Robotic-CLIP by fine-tuning CLIP on 309,433 videos (~7.4 million frames) of action data using contrastive learning. By leveraging action data, Robotic-CLIP inherits CLIP's strong image performance while gaining the ability to understand actions in robotic contexts. Intensive experiments show that our Robotic-CLIP outperforms other CLIP-based models across various language-driven robotic tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness of Robotic-CLIP in real-world grasping applications.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Long-CLIP: Unlocking the Long-Text Capability of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15378v3)** | 2024-07-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been the cornerstone for zero-shot classification, text-image retrieval, and text-image generation by aligning image and text modalities. Despite its widespread adoption, a significant limitation of CLIP lies in the inadequate length of text input. The length of the text token is restricted to 77, and an empirical study shows the actual effective length is even less than 20. This prevents CLIP from handling detailed descriptions, limiting its applications for image retrieval and text-to-image generation with extensive prerequisites. To this end, we propose Long-CLIP as a plug-and-play alternative to CLIP that supports long-text input, retains or even surpasses its zero-shot generalizability, and aligns the CLIP latent space, making it readily replace CLIP without any further adaptation in downstream frameworks. Nevertheless, achieving this goal is far from straightforward, as simplistic fine-tuning can result in a significant degradation of CLIP's performance. Moreover, substituting the text encoder with a language model supporting longer contexts necessitates pretraining with vast amounts of data, incurring significant expenses. Accordingly, Long-CLIP introduces an efficient fine-tuning solution on CLIP with two novel strategies designed to maintain the original capabilities, including (1) a knowledge-preserved stretching of positional embedding and (2) a primary component matching of CLIP features. With leveraging just one million extra long text-image pairs, Long-CLIP has shown the superiority to CLIP for about 20% in long caption text-image retrieval and 6% in traditional text-image retrieval tasks, e.g., COCO and Flickr30k. Furthermore, Long-CLIP offers enhanced capabilities for generating images from detailed text descriptions by replacing CLIP in a plug-and-play manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2024.

| **[PPO-Clip Attains Global Optimality: Towards Deeper Understandings of Clipping](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.12065v2)** | 2024-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm employing a clipped surrogate objective (PPO-Clip) is a prominent exemplar of the policy optimization methods. However, despite its remarkable empirical success, PPO-Clip lacks theoretical substantiation to date. In this paper, we contribute to the field by establishing the first global convergence results of a PPO-Clip variant in both tabular and neural function approximation settings. Our findings highlight the $O(1/\sqrt{T})$ min-iterate convergence rate specifically in the context of neural function approximation. We tackle the inherent challenges in analyzing PPO-Clip through three central concepts: (i) We introduce a generalized version of the PPO-Clip objective, illuminated by its connection with the hinge loss. (ii) Employing entropic mirror descent, we establish asymptotic convergence for tabular PPO-Clip with direct policy parameterization. (iii) Inspired by the tabular analysis, we streamline convergence analysis by introducing a two-step policy improvement approach. This decouples policy search from complex neural policy parameterization using a regression-based update scheme. Furthermore, we gain deeper insights into the efficacy of PPO-Clip by interpreting these generalized objectives. Our theoretical findings also mark the first characterization of the influence of the clipping mechanism on PPO-Clip convergence. Importantly, the clipping range affects only the pre-constant of the convergence rate.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clipped SGD Algorithms for Performative Prediction: Tight Bounds for Clipping Bias and Remedies](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10995v2)** | 2025-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the convergence of clipped stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms with decision-dependent data distribution. Our setting is motivated by privacy preserving optimization algorithms that interact with performative data where the prediction models can influence future outcomes. This challenging setting involves the non-smooth clipping operator and non-gradient dynamics due to distribution shifts. We make two contributions in pursuit for a performative stable solution using clipped SGD algorithms. First, we characterize the clipping bias with projected clipped SGD (PCSGD) algorithm which is caused by the clipping operator that prevents PCSGD from reaching a stable solution. When the loss function is strongly convex, we quantify the lower and upper bounds for this clipping bias and demonstrate a bias amplification phenomenon with the sensitivity of data distribution. When the loss function is non-convex, we bound the magnitude of stationarity bias. Second, we propose remedies to mitigate the bias either by utilizing an optimal step size design for PCSGD, or to apply the recent DiceSGD algorithm [Zhang et al., 2024]. Our analysis is also extended to show that the latter algorithm is free from clipping bias in the performative setting. Numerical experiments verify our findings.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[AA-CLIP: Enhancing Zero-shot Anomaly Detection via Anomaly-Aware CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06661v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection (AD) identifies outliers for applications like defect and lesion detection. While CLIP shows promise for zero-shot AD tasks due to its strong generalization capabilities, its inherent Anomaly-Unawareness leads to limited discrimination between normal and abnormal features. To address this problem, we propose Anomaly-Aware CLIP (AA-CLIP), which enhances CLIP's anomaly discrimination ability in both text and visual spaces while preserving its generalization capability. AA-CLIP is achieved through a straightforward yet effective two-stage approach: it first creates anomaly-aware text anchors to differentiate normal and abnormal semantics clearly, then aligns patch-level visual features with these anchors for precise anomaly localization. This two-stage strategy, with the help of residual adapters, gradually adapts CLIP in a controlled manner, achieving effective AD while maintaining CLIP's class knowledge. Extensive experiments validate AA-CLIP as a resource-efficient solution for zero-shot AD tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in industrial and medical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/Mwxinnn/AA-CLIP.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can CLIP Count Stars? An Empirical Study on Quantity Bias in CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15035v1)** | 2024-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP has demonstrated great versatility in adapting to various downstream tasks, such as image editing and generation, visual question answering, and video understanding. However, CLIP-based applications often suffer from misunderstandings regarding user intent, leading to discrepancies between the required number of objects and the actual outputs in image generation tasks. In this work, we empirically investigate the quantity bias in CLIP. By carefully designing different experimental settings and datasets, we comprehensively evaluate CLIP's understanding of quantity from text, image, and cross-modal perspectives. Our experimental results reveal a quantity bias in CLIP embeddings, impacting the reliability of downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Short...</summary><p>Short paper.

| **[CLIP-EBC: CLIP Can Count Accurately through Enhanced Blockwise Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09281v3)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose CLIP-EBC, the first fully CLIP-based model for accurate crowd density estimation. While the CLIP model has demonstrated remarkable success in addressing recognition tasks such as zero-shot image classification, its potential for counting has been largely unexplored due to the inherent challenges in transforming a regression problem, such as counting, into a recognition task. In this work, we investigate and enhance CLIP's ability to count, focusing specifically on the task of estimating crowd sizes from images. Existing classification-based crowd-counting frameworks have significant limitations, including the quantization of count values into bordering real-valued bins and the sole focus on classification errors. These practices result in label ambiguity near the shared borders and inaccurate prediction of count values. Hence, directly applying CLIP within these frameworks may yield suboptimal performance. To address these challenges, we first propose the Enhanced Blockwise Classification (EBC) framework. Unlike previous methods, EBC utilizes integer-valued bins, effectively reducing ambiguity near bin boundaries. Additionally, it incorporates a regression loss based on density maps to improve the prediction of count values. Within our backbone-agnostic EBC framework, we then introduce CLIP-EBC to fully leverage CLIP's recognition capabilities for this task. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of EBC and the competitive performance of CLIP-EBC. Specifically, our EBC framework can improve existing classification-based methods by up to 44.5% on the UCF-QNRF dataset, and CLIP-EBC achieves state-of-the-art performance on the NWPU-Crowd test set, with an MAE of 58.2 and an RMSE of 268.5, representing improvements of 8.6% and 13.3% over the previous best method, STEERER.

| **[Demystifying CLIP Data](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.16671v5)** | 2024-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is an approach that has advanced research and applications in computer vision, fueling modern recognition systems and generative models. We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its data and not the model architecture or pre-training objective. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3% on ViT-B models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains 72.4%. Our observations hold across various model sizes, exemplified by ViT-H achieving 80.5%, without any bells-and-whistles. Curation code and training data distribution on metadata is made available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/MetaCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2103.00020 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[un$^2$CLIP: Improving CLIP's Visual Detail Capturing Ability via Inverting unCLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24517v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a foundation model and has been applied to various vision and multimodal tasks. However, recent works indicate that CLIP falls short in distinguishing detailed differences in images and shows suboptimal performance on dense-prediction and vision-centric multimodal tasks. Therefore, this work focuses on improving existing CLIP models, aiming to capture as many visual details in images as possible. We find that a specific type of generative models, unCLIP, provides a suitable framework for achieving our goal. Specifically, unCLIP trains an image generator conditioned on the CLIP image embedding. In other words, it inverts the CLIP image encoder. Compared to discriminative models like CLIP, generative models are better at capturing image details because they are trained to learn the data distribution of images. Additionally, the conditional input space of unCLIP aligns with CLIP's original image-text embedding space. Therefore, we propose to invert unCLIP (dubbed un$^2$CLIP) to improve the CLIP model. In this way, the improved image encoder can gain unCLIP's visual detail capturing ability while preserving its alignment with the original text encoder simultaneously. We evaluate our improved CLIP across various tasks to which CLIP has been applied, including the challenging MMVP-VLM benchmark, the dense-prediction open-vocabulary segmentation task, and multimodal large language model tasks. Experiments show that un$^2$CLIP significantly improves the original CLIP and previous CLIP improvement methods. Code and models will be available at https://github.com/LiYinqi/un2CLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Alpha-CLIP: A CLIP Model Focusing on Wherever You Want](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.03818v2)** | 2023-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) plays an essential role in extracting valuable content information from images across diverse tasks. It aligns textual and visual modalities to comprehend the entire image, including all the details, even those irrelevant to specific tasks. However, for a finer understanding and controlled editing of images, it becomes crucial to focus on specific regions of interest, which can be indicated as points, masks, or boxes by humans or perception models. To fulfill the requirements, we introduce Alpha-CLIP, an enhanced version of CLIP with an auxiliary alpha channel to suggest attentive regions and fine-tuned with constructed millions of RGBA region-text pairs. Alpha-CLIP not only preserves the visual recognition ability of CLIP but also enables precise control over the emphasis of image contents. It demonstrates effectiveness in various tasks, including but not limited to open-world recognition, multimodal large language models, and conditional 2D / 3D generation. It has a strong potential to serve as a versatile tool for image-related tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://aleafy.github.io/alpha-clip code: https://github.com/SunzeY/AlphaCLIP</p></details> |

While integrating MoE into multimodal models like CLIP improves performance, training these models is notoriously challenging and expensive. We propose CLIP-Upcycling (CLIP-UP), an efficient alternative training strategy that converts a pre-trained dense CLIP model into a sparse MoE architecture. Through extensive experimentation with various settings and auxiliary losses, we demonstrate that CLIP-UP significantly reduces training complexity and cost. Remarkably, our sparse CLIP B/16 model, trained with CLIP-UP, outperforms its dense counterpart by 7.2% and 6.6% on COCO and Flickr30k text-to-image Recall@1 benchmarks respectively. It even surpasses the larger CLIP L/14 model on this task while using only 30% of the inference FLOPs. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our training recipe across different scales, establishing sparse upcycling as a practical and scalable approach for building efficient, high-performance CLIP models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into the Openness of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.01986v3)** | 2023-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) formulates image classification as an image-to-text matching task, i.e., matching images to the corresponding natural language descriptions instead of discrete category IDs. This allows for open-vocabulary visual recognition, where the model can recognize images from an open class set (also known as an open vocabulary) in a zero-shot manner. However, evaluating the openness of CLIP-like models is challenging, as the models are open to arbitrary vocabulary in theory, but their accuracy varies in practice. To address this, we resort to an incremental perspective to assess the openness through vocabulary expansions, and define extensibility to measure a model's ability to handle novel classes. Our evaluation shows that CLIP-like models are not truly open, and their performance deteriorates as the vocabulary expands. We further dissect the feature space of CLIP from the perspectives of representation alignment and uniformity. Our investigation reveals that the overestimation of openness is due to confusion among competing text features, rather than a failure to capture the similarity between image features and text features of novel classes. We hope that our investigation and analysis will facilitate future research on the CLIP openness issue.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Findings of ACL 2023 (Long Paper).

However, due to the immaturity of the technology, the quality of the generated images varies, so it is important to develop quality assessment techniques for the generated images. Although some models have been proposed to assess the quality of generated images, they are inadequate when faced with the ever-increasing and diverse categories of generated images. Consequently, the development of more advanced and effective models for evaluating the quality of generated images is urgently needed. Recent research has explored the significant potential of the visual language model CLIP in image quality assessment, finding that it performs well in evaluating the quality of natural images. However, its application to generated images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we build on this idea and further explore the potential of CLIP in evaluating the quality of generated images. We design CLIP-AGIQA, a CLIP-based regression model for quality assessment of generated images, leveraging rich visual and textual knowledge encapsulated in CLIP. Particularly, we implement multi-category learnable prompts to fully utilize the textual knowledge in CLIP for quality assessment. Extensive experiments on several generated image quality assessment benchmarks, including AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, demonstrate that CLIP-AGIQA outperforms existing IQA models, achieving excellent results in evaluating the quality of generated images.</p></details> | accepted by ICPR2024 |

Unsupervised domain adaptation (DA) has emerged as a popular solution to this problem. However, current DA techniques rely on visual backbones, which may lack semantic richness. Despite the potential of large-scale vision-language foundation models like CLIP, their effectiveness for DA has yet to be fully explored. To address this gap, we introduce \textsc{AD-CLIP}, a domain-agnostic prompt learning strategy for CLIP that aims to solve the DA problem in the prompt space. We leverage the frozen vision backbone of CLIP to extract both image style (domain) and content information, which we apply to learn prompt tokens. Our prompts are designed to be domain-invariant and class-generalizable, by conditioning prompt learning on image style and content features simultaneously. We use standard supervised contrastive learning in the source domain, while proposing an entropy minimization strategy to align domains in the embedding space given the target domain data. We also consider a scenario where only target domain samples are available during testing, without any source domain data, and propose a cross-domain style mapping network to hallucinate domain-agnostic tokens. Our extensive experiments on three benchmark DA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \textsc{AD-CLIP} compared to existing literature.

| **[CLIP-VIS: Adapting CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Video Instance Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12455v3)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary video instance segmentation strives to segment and track instances belonging to an open set of categories in a videos. The vision-language model Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown robust zero-shot classification ability in image-level open-vocabulary tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple encoder-decoder network, called CLIP-VIS, to adapt CLIP for open-vocabulary video instance segmentation. Our CLIP-VIS adopts frozen CLIP and introduces three modules, including class-agnostic mask generation, temporal topK-enhanced matching, and weighted open-vocabulary classification. Given a set of initial queries, class-agnostic mask generation introduces a pixel decoder and a transformer decoder on CLIP pre-trained image encoder to predict query masks and corresponding object scores and mask IoU scores. Then, temporal topK-enhanced matching performs query matching across frames using the K mostly matched frames. Finally, weighted open-vocabulary classification first employs mask pooling to generate query visual features from CLIP pre-trained image encoder, and second performs weighted classification using object scores and mask IoU scores. Our CLIP-VIS does not require the annotations of instance categories and identities. The experiments are performed on various video instance segmentation datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, especially for novel categories. When using ConvNeXt-B as backbone, our CLIP-VIS achieves the AP and APn scores of 32.2% and 40.2% on the validation set of LV-VIS dataset, which outperforms OV2Seg by 11.1% and 23.9% respectively. We will release the source code and models at https://github.com/zwq456/CLIP-VIS.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16181v4)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |

It has shown promising results across various tasks due to its generalizability and interpretability. The use of CLIP has recently gained increasing interest in the medical imaging domain, serving as a pre-training paradigm for image-text alignment, or a critical component in diverse clinical tasks. With the aim of facilitating a deeper understanding of this promising direction, this survey offers an in-depth exploration of the CLIP within the domain of medical imaging, regarding both refined CLIP pre-training and CLIP-driven applications. In this paper, we (1) first start with a brief introduction to the fundamentals of CLIP methodology; (2) then investigate the adaptation of CLIP pre-training in the medical imaging domain, focusing on how to optimize CLIP given characteristics of medical images and reports; (3) further explore practical utilization of CLIP pre-trained models in various tasks, including classification, dense prediction, and cross-modal tasks; and (4) finally discuss existing limitations of CLIP in the context of medical imaging, and propose forward-looking directions to address the demands of medical imaging domain. Studies featuring technical and practical value are both investigated. We expect this survey will provide researchers with a holistic understanding of the CLIP paradigm and its potential implications.

| **[Irregularly Clipped Sparse Regression Codes](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01573v1)** | 2021-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, it was found that clipping can significantly improve the section error rate (SER) performance of sparse regression (SR) codes if an optimal clipping threshold is chosen. In this paper, we propose irregularly clipped SR codes, where multiple clipping thresholds are applied to symbols according to a distribution, to further improve the SER performance of SR codes. Orthogonal approximate message passing (OAMP) algorithm is used for decoding. Using state evolution, the distribution of irregular clipping thresholds is optimized to minimize the SER of OAMP decoding. As a result, optimized irregularly clipped SR codes achieve a better tradeoff between clipping distortion and noise distortion than regularly clipped SR codes. Numerical results demonstrate that irregularly clipped SR codes achieve 0.4 dB gain in signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) over regularly clipped SR codes at code length$\,\approx2.5\!\times\! 10^4$ and SER$\,\approx10^{-5}$. We further show that irregularly clipped SR codes are robust over a wide range of code rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, submitted to IEEE ITW 2021</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-MoE: Towards Building Mixture of Experts for CLIP with Diversified Multiplet Upcycling](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19291v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in multimodal intelligence. However, recent studies discovered that CLIP can only encode one aspect of the feature space, leading to substantial information loss and indistinctive features. To mitigate this issue, this paper introduces a novel strategy that fine-tunes a series of complementary CLIP models and transforms them into a CLIP-MoE. Specifically, we propose a model-agnostic Diversified Multiplet Upcycling (DMU) framework for CLIP. Instead of training multiple CLIP models from scratch, DMU leverages a pre-trained CLIP and fine-tunes it into a diverse set with highly cost-effective multistage contrastive learning, thus capturing distinct feature subspaces efficiently. To fully exploit these fine-tuned models while minimizing computational overhead, we transform them into a CLIP-MoE, which dynamically activates a subset of CLIP experts, achieving an effective balance between model capacity and computational cost. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of CLIP-MoE across various zero-shot retrieval, zero-shot image classification tasks, and downstream Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) benchmarks when used as a vision encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Batch Clipping and Adaptive Layerwise Clipping for Differential Private Stochastic Gradient Descent](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11939v1)** | 2023-07-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Each round in Differential Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DPSGD) transmits a sum of clipped gradients obfuscated with Gaussian noise to a central server which uses this to update a global model which often represents a deep neural network. Since the clipped gradients are computed separately, which we call Individual Clipping (IC), deep neural networks like resnet-18 cannot use Batch Normalization Layers (BNL) which is a crucial component in deep neural networks for achieving a high accuracy. To utilize BNL, we introduce Batch Clipping (BC) where, instead of clipping single gradients as in the orginal DPSGD, we average and clip batches of gradients. Moreover, the model entries of different layers have different sensitivities to the added Gaussian noise. Therefore, Adaptive Layerwise Clipping methods (ALC), where each layer has its own adaptively finetuned clipping constant, have been introduced and studied, but so far without rigorous DP proofs. In this paper, we propose {\em a new ALC and provide rigorous DP proofs for both BC and ALC}. Experiments show that our modified DPSGD with BC and ALC for CIFAR-$10$ with resnet-$18$ converges while DPSGD with IC and ALC does not.</p></details> | 20 pages, 18 Figures |
| **[Per-Clip Video Object Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.01924v1)** | 2022-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, memory-based approaches show promising results on semi-supervised video object segmentation. These methods predict object masks frame-by-frame with the help of frequently updated memory of the previous mask. Different from this per-frame inference, we investigate an alternative perspective by treating video object segmentation as clip-wise mask propagation. In this per-clip inference scheme, we update the memory with an interval and simultaneously process a set of consecutive frames (i.e. clip) between the memory updates. The scheme provides two potential benefits: accuracy gain by clip-level optimization and efficiency gain by parallel computation of multiple frames. To this end, we propose a new method tailored for the per-clip inference. Specifically, we first introduce a clip-wise operation to refine the features based on intra-clip correlation. In addition, we employ a progressive matching mechanism for efficient information-passing within a clip. With the synergy of two modules and a newly proposed per-clip based training, our network achieves state-of-the-art performance on Youtube-VOS 2018/2019 val (84.6% and 84.6%) and DAVIS 2016/2017 val (91.9% and 86.1%). Furthermore, our model shows a great speed-accuracy trade-off with varying memory update intervals, which leads to huge flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2022; Code is available at https://github.com/pkyong95/PCVOS</p></details> |
| **[DisCo-CLIP: A Distributed Contrastive Loss for Memory Efficient CLIP Training](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.08480v1)** | 2023-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose DisCo-CLIP, a distributed memory-efficient CLIP training approach, to reduce the memory consumption of contrastive loss when training contrastive learning models. Our approach decomposes the contrastive loss and its gradient computation into two parts, one to calculate the intra-GPU gradients and the other to compute the inter-GPU gradients. According to our decomposition, only the intra-GPU gradients are computed on the current GPU, while the inter-GPU gradients are collected via all_reduce from other GPUs instead of being repeatedly computed on every GPU. In this way, we can reduce the GPU memory consumption of contrastive loss computation from $\bigO(B^2)$ to $\bigO(\frac{B^2}{N})$, where $B$ and $N$ are the batch size and the number of GPUs used for training. Such a distributed solution is mathematically equivalent to the original non-distributed contrastive loss computation, without sacrificing any computation accuracy. It is particularly efficient for large-batch CLIP training. For instance, DisCo-CLIP can enable contrastive training of a ViT-B/32 model with a batch size of 32K or 196K using 8 or 64 A100 40GB GPUs, compared with the original CLIP solution which requires 128 A100 40GB GPUs to train a ViT-B/32 model with a batch size of 32K.

| **[Control-CLIP: Decoupling Category and Style Guidance in CLIP for Specific-Domain Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11532v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have shown remarkable capabilities of generating high-quality images closely aligned with textual inputs. However, the effectiveness of text guidance heavily relies on the CLIP text encoder, which is trained to pay more attention to general content but struggles to capture semantics in specific domains like styles. As a result, generation models tend to fail on prompts like "a photo of a cat in Pokemon style" in terms of simply producing images depicting "a photo of a cat". To fill this gap, we propose Control-CLIP, a novel decoupled CLIP fine-tuning framework that enables the CLIP model to learn the meaning of category and style in a complement manner. With specially designed fine-tuning tasks on minimal data and a modified cross-attention mechanism, Control-CLIP can precisely guide the diffusion model to a specific domain. Moreover, the parameters of the diffusion model remain unchanged at all, preserving the original generation performance and diversity. Experiments across multiple domains confirm the effectiveness of our approach, particularly highlighting its robust plug-and-play capability in generating content with various specific styles.</p></details> |  |

| **[Unsupervised Meta-Learning for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.04640v3)** | 2020-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Meta-learning algorithms use past experience to learn to quickly solve new tasks. In the context of reinforcement learning, meta-learning algorithms acquire reinforcement learning procedures to solve new problems more efficiently by utilizing experience from prior tasks. The performance of meta-learning algorithms depends on the tasks available for meta-training: in the same way that supervised learning generalizes best to test points drawn from the same distribution as the training points, meta-learning methods generalize best to tasks from the same distribution as the meta-training tasks. In effect, meta-reinforcement learning offloads the design burden from algorithm design to task design. If we can automate the process of task design as well, we can devise a meta-learning algorithm that is truly automated. In this work, we take a step in this direction, proposing a family of unsupervised meta-learning algorithms for reinforcement learning. We motivate and describe a general recipe for unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning, and present an instantiation of this approach. Our conceptual and theoretical contributions consist of formulating the unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning problem and describing how task proposals based on mutual information can be used to train optimal meta-learners. Our experimental results indicate that unsupervised meta-reinforcement learning effectively acquires accelerated reinforcement learning procedures without the need for manual task design and these procedures exceed the performance of learning from scratch.</p></details> | <details><summary>First...</summary><p>First two authors contributed equally</p></details> |
| **[Lineage Evolution Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14616v1)** | 2020-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general agent population learning system, and on this basis, we propose lineage evolution reinforcement learning algorithm. Lineage evolution reinforcement learning is a kind of derivative algorithm which accords with the general agent population learning system. We take the agents in DQN and its related variants as the basic agents in the population, and add the selection, mutation and crossover modules in the genetic algorithm to the reinforcement learning algorithm. In the process of agent evolution, we refer to the characteristics of natural genetic behavior, add lineage factor to ensure the retention of potential performance of agent, and comprehensively consider the current performance and lineage value when evaluating the performance of agent. Without changing the parameters of the original reinforcement learning algorithm, lineage evolution reinforcement learning can optimize different reinforcement learning algorithms. Our experiments show that the idea of evolution with lineage improves the performance of original reinforcement learning algorithm in some games in Atari 2600.</p></details> |  |

| **[Transfer Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.07888v7)** | 2023-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is a learning paradigm for solving sequential decision-making problems. Recent years have witnessed remarkable progress in reinforcement learning upon the fast development of deep neural networks. Along with the promising prospects of reinforcement learning in numerous domains such as robotics and game-playing, transfer learning has arisen to tackle various challenges faced by reinforcement learning, by transferring knowledge from external expertise to facilitate the efficiency and effectiveness of the learning process. In this survey, we systematically investigate the recent progress of transfer learning approaches in the context of deep reinforcement learning. Specifically, we provide a framework for categorizing the state-of-the-art transfer learning approaches, under which we analyze their goals, methodologies, compatible reinforcement learning backbones, and practical applications. We also draw connections between transfer learning and other relevant topics from the reinforcement learning perspective and explore their potential challenges that await future research progress.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Reinforcement Learning: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01452v2)** | 2023-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning is an essential paradigm for solving sequential decision problems under uncertainty. Despite many remarkable achievements in recent decades, applying reinforcement learning methods in the real world remains challenging. One of the main obstacles is that reinforcement learning agents lack a fundamental understanding of the world and must therefore learn from scratch through numerous trial-and-error interactions. They may also face challenges in providing explanations for their decisions and generalizing the acquired knowledge. Causality, however, offers a notable advantage as it can formalize knowledge in a systematic manner and leverage invariance for effective knowledge transfer. This has led to the emergence of causal reinforcement learning, a subfield of reinforcement learning that seeks to enhance existing algorithms by incorporating causal relationships into the learning process. In this survey, we comprehensively review the literature on causal reinforcement learning. We first introduce the basic concepts of causality and reinforcement learning, and then explain how causality can address core challenges in non-causal reinforcement learning. We categorize and systematically review existing causal reinforcement learning approaches based on their target problems and methodologies. Finally, we outline open issues and future directions in this emerging field.</p></details> | 52 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Two-Memory Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.10098v2)** | 2023-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While deep reinforcement learning has shown important empirical success, it tends to learn relatively slow due to slow propagation of rewards information and slow update of parametric neural networks. Non-parametric episodic memory, on the other hand, provides a faster learning alternative that does not require representation learning and uses maximum episodic return as state-action values for action selection. Episodic memory and reinforcement learning both have their own strengths and weaknesses. Notably, humans can leverage multiple memory systems concurrently during learning and benefit from all of them. In this work, we propose a method called Two-Memory reinforcement learning agent (2M) that combines episodic memory and reinforcement learning to distill both of their strengths. The 2M agent exploits the speed of the episodic memory part and the optimality and the generalization capacity of the reinforcement learning part to complement each other. Our experiments demonstrate that the 2M agent is more data efficient and outperforms both pure episodic memory and pure reinforcement learning, as well as a state-of-the-art memory-augmented RL agent. Moreover, the proposed approach provides a general framework that can be used to combine any episodic memory agent with other off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Different from the existing preference-based and ranking-based reinforcement learning paradigms, based on human relative preferences over sample pairs, the proposed rating-based reinforcement learning approach is based on human evaluation of individual trajectories without relative comparisons between sample pairs. The rating-based reinforcement learning approach builds on a new prediction model for human ratings and a novel multi-class loss function. We conduct several experimental studies based on synthetic ratings and real human ratings to evaluate the effectiveness and benefits of the new rating-based reinforcement learning approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of the paper "Rating-based Reinforcement Learning" accepted to the 38th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in R](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.00240v1)** | 2018-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning refers to a group of methods from artificial intelligence where an agent performs learning through trial and error. It differs from supervised learning, since reinforcement learning requires no explicit labels; instead, the agent interacts continuously with its environment. That is, the agent starts in a specific state and then performs an action, based on which it transitions to a new state and, depending on the outcome, receives a reward. Different strategies (e.g. Q-learning) have been proposed to maximize the overall reward, resulting in a so-called policy, which defines the best possible action in each state. Mathematically, this process can be formalized by a Markov decision process and it has been implemented by packages in R; however, there is currently no package available for reinforcement learning. As a remedy, this paper demonstrates how to perform reinforcement learning in R and, for this purpose, introduces the ReinforcementLearning package. The package provides a remarkably flexible framework and is easily applied to a wide range of different problems. We demonstrate its use by drawing upon common examples from the literature (e.g. finding optimal game strategies).</p></details> |  |

There are state of the art methodologies to detect the impact of concept drift, however general strategy considered to overcome the issue in performance is to rebuild or re-calibrate the model periodically as the variable patterns for the model changes significantly due to market change or consumer behavior change etc. Quantitative research is the most widely spread application of data science in Marketing or financial domain where applicability of state of the art reinforcement learning for auto-learning is less explored paradigm. Reinforcement learning is heavily dependent on having a simulated environment which is majorly available for gaming or online systems, to learn from the live feedback. However, there are some research happened on the area of online advertisement, pricing etc where due to the nature of the online learning environment scope of reinforcement learning is explored. Our proposed solution is a reinforcement learning based, true self-learning algorithm which can adapt to the data change or concept drift and auto learn and self-calibrate for the new patterns of the data solving the problem of concept drift.

Boosting combines several regression trees to improve their accuracy without significantly reducing their inherent interpretability.

Despite the success of previous transfer learning approaches in deep reinforcement learning, directly transferring data or models from an agent to another agent is often not allowed due to the privacy of data and/or models in many privacy-aware applications. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning framework to federatively build models of high-quality for agents with consideration of their privacies, namely Federated deep Reinforcement Learning (FedRL). To protect the privacy of data and models, we exploit Gausian differentials on the information shared with each other when updating their local models. In the experiment, we evaluate our FedRL framework in two diverse domains, Grid-world and Text2Action domains, by comparing to various baselines.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

| **[A Definition of Continual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.11046v2)** | 2023-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a standard view of the reinforcement learning problem, an agent's goal is to efficiently identify a policy that maximizes long-term reward. However, this perspective is based on a restricted view of learning as finding a solution, rather than treating learning as endless adaptation. In contrast, continual reinforcement learning refers to the setting in which the best agents never stop learning. Despite the importance of continual reinforcement learning, the community lacks a simple definition of the problem that highlights its commitments and makes its primary concepts precise and clear. To this end, this paper is dedicated to carefully defining the continual reinforcement learning problem. We formalize the notion of agents that "never stop learning" through a new mathematical language for analyzing and cataloging agents. Using this new language, we define a continual learning agent as one that can be understood as carrying out an implicit search process indefinitely, and continual reinforcement learning as the setting in which the best agents are all continual learning agents. We provide two motivating examples, illustrating that traditional views of multi-task reinforcement learning and continual supervised learning are special cases of our definition. Collectively, these definitions and perspectives formalize many intuitive concepts at the heart of learning, and open new research pathways surrounding continual learning agents.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2023 |
| **[Rethinking the Foundations for Continual Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.08161v3)** | 2025-07-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the traditional view of reinforcement learning, the agent's goal is to find an optimal policy that maximizes its expected sum of rewards. Once the agent finds this policy, the learning ends. This view contrasts with \emph{continual reinforcement learning}, where learning does not end, and agents are expected to continually learn and adapt indefinitely. Despite the clear distinction between these two paradigms of learning, much of the progress in continual reinforcement learning has been shaped by foundations rooted in the traditional view of reinforcement learning. In this paper, we first examine whether the foundations of traditional reinforcement learning are suitable for the continual reinforcement learning paradigm. We identify four key pillars of the traditional reinforcement learning foundations that are antithetical to the goals of continual learning: the Markov decision process formalism, the focus on atemporal artifacts, the expected sum of rewards as an evaluation metric, and episodic benchmark environments that embrace the other three foundations. We then propose a new formalism that sheds the first and the third foundations and replaces them with the history process as a mathematical formalism and a new definition of deviation regret, adapted for continual learning, as an evaluation metric. Finally, we discuss possible approaches to shed the other two foundations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Robust Rewards with Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.11248v2)** | 2018-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and general framework for decision making and control, but its application in practice is often hindered by the need for extensive feature and reward engineering. Deep reinforcement learning methods can remove the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still require a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning holds the promise of automatic reward acquisition, but has proven exceptionally difficult to apply to large, high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. In this work, we propose adverserial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training. Our experiments show that AIRL greatly outperforms prior methods in these transfer settings.</p></details> |  |

In Malthusian RL, increases in a subpopulation's average return drive subsequent increases in its size, just as Thomas Malthus argued in 1798 was the relationship between preindustrial income levels and population growth. Malthusian reinforcement learning harnesses the competitive pressures arising from growing and shrinking population size to drive agents to explore regions of state and policy spaces that they could not otherwise reach. Furthermore, in environments where there are potential gains from specialization and division of labor, we show that Malthusian reinforcement learning is better positioned to take advantage of such synergies than algorithms based on self-play.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Deep Ordinal Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02005v2)** | 2020-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning usually makes use of numerical rewards, which have nice properties but also come with drawbacks and difficulties. Using rewards on an ordinal scale (ordinal rewards) is an alternative to numerical rewards that has received more attention in recent years. In this paper, a general approach to adapting reinforcement learning problems to the use of ordinal rewards is presented and motivated. We show how to convert common reinforcement learning algorithms to an ordinal variation by the example of Q-learning and introduce Ordinal Deep Q-Networks, which adapt deep reinforcement learning to ordinal rewards. Additionally, we run evaluations on problems provided by the OpenAI Gym framework, showing that our ordinal variants exhibit a performance that is comparable to the numerical variations for a number of problems. We also give first evidence that our ordinal variant is able to produce better results for problems with less engineered and simpler-to-design reward signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>repla...</summary><p>replaced figures for better visibility, added github repository, more details about source of experimental results, updated target value calculation for standard and ordinal Deep Q-Network</p></details> |

Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep $Q$-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning.

| **[A View on Deep Reinforcement Learning in System Optimization](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.01275v3)** | 2019-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world systems problems require reasoning about the long term consequences of actions taken to configure and manage the system. These problems with delayed and often sequentially aggregated reward, are often inherently reinforcement learning problems and present the opportunity to leverage the recent substantial advances in deep reinforcement learning. However, in some cases, it is not clear why deep reinforcement learning is a good fit for the problem. Sometimes, it does not perform better than the state-of-the-art solutions. And in other cases, random search or greedy algorithms could outperform deep reinforcement learning. In this paper, we review, discuss, and evaluate the recent trends of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. We propose a set of essential metrics to guide future works in evaluating the efficacy of using deep reinforcement learning in system optimization. Our evaluation includes challenges, the types of problems, their formulation in the deep reinforcement learning setting, embedding, the model used, efficiency, and robustness. We conclude with a discussion on open challenges and potential directions for pushing further the integration of reinforcement learning in system optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Review of Uncertainty for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.09052v1)** | 2022-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty is ubiquitous in games, both in the agents playing games and often in the games themselves. Working with uncertainty is therefore an important component of successful deep reinforcement learning agents. While there has been substantial effort and progress in understanding and working with uncertainty for supervised learning, the body of literature for uncertainty aware deep reinforcement learning is less developed. While many of the same problems regarding uncertainty in neural networks for supervised learning remain for reinforcement learning, there are additional sources of uncertainty due to the nature of an interactable environment. In this work, we provide an overview motivating and presenting existing techniques in uncertainty aware deep reinforcement learning. These works show empirical benefits on a variety of reinforcement learning tasks. This work serves to help to centralize the disparate results and promote future research in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AIIDE 2022</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in Economics and Finance](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.10014v1)** | 2020-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning algorithms describe how an agent can learn an optimal action policy in a sequential decision process, through repeated experience. In a given environment, the agent policy provides him some running and terminal rewards. As in online learning, the agent learns sequentially. As in multi-armed bandit problems, when an agent picks an action, he can not infer ex-post the rewards induced by other action choices. In reinforcement learning, his actions have consequences: they influence not only rewards, but also future states of the world. The goal of reinforcement learning is to find an optimal policy -- a mapping from the states of the world to the set of actions, in order to maximize cumulative reward, which is a long term strategy. Exploring might be sub-optimal on a short-term horizon but could lead to optimal long-term ones. Many problems of optimal control, popular in economics for more than forty years, can be expressed in the reinforcement learning framework, and recent advances in computational science, provided in particular by deep learning algorithms, can be used by economists in order to solve complex behavioral problems. In this article, we propose a state-of-the-art of reinforcement learning techniques, and present applications in economics, game theory, operation research and finance.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Difficulty of Passive Learning in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14020v1)** | 2021-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning to act from observational data without active environmental interaction is a well-known challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL). Recent approaches involve constraints on the learned policy or conservative updates, preventing strong deviations from the state-action distribution of the dataset. Although these methods are evaluated using non-linear function approximation, theoretical justifications are mostly limited to the tabular or linear cases. Given the impressive results of deep reinforcement learning, we argue for a need to more clearly understand the challenges in this setting. In the vein of Held & Hein's classic 1963 experiment, we propose the "tandem learning" experimental paradigm which facilitates our empirical analysis of the difficulties in offline reinforcement learning. We identify function approximation in conjunction with fixed data distributions as the strongest factors, thereby extending but also challenging hypotheses stated in past work. Our results provide relevant insights for offline deep reinforcement learning, while also shedding new light on phenomena observed in the online case of learning control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at NeurIPS 2021</p></details> |
| **[A survey of benchmarking frameworks for reinforcement learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13577v1)** | 2020-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has recently experienced increased prominence in the machine learning community. There are many approaches to solving reinforcement learning problems with new techniques developed constantly. When solving problems using reinforcement learning, there are various difficult challenges to overcome. To ensure progress in the field, benchmarks are important for testing new algorithms and comparing with other approaches. The reproducibility of results for fair comparison is therefore vital in ensuring that improvements are accurately judged. This paper provides an overview of different contributions to reinforcement learning benchmarking and discusses how they can assist researchers to address the challenges facing reinforcement learning. The contributions discussed are the most used and recent in the literature. The paper discusses the contributions in terms of implementation, tasks and provided algorithm implementations with benchmarks. The survey aims to bring attention to the wide range of reinforcement learning benchmarking tasks available and to encourage research to take place in a standardised manner.

| **[Reinforcement Learning and Machine ethics:a systematic review](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02425v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine ethics is the field that studies how ethical behaviour can be accomplished by autonomous systems. While there exist some systematic reviews aiming to consolidate the state of the art in machine ethics prior to 2020, these tend to not include work that uses reinforcement learning agents as entities whose ethical behaviour is to be achieved. The reason for this is that only in the last years we have witnessed an increase in machine ethics studies within reinforcement learning. We present here a systematic review of reinforcement learning for machine ethics and machine ethics within reinforcement learning. Additionally, we highlight trends in terms of ethics specifications, components and frameworks of reinforcement learning, and environments used to result in ethical behaviour. Our systematic review aims to consolidate the work in machine ethics and reinforcement learning thus completing the gap in the state of the art machine ethics landscape</p></details> |  |

| **[Image Embedded Segmentation: Uniting Supervised and Unsupervised Objectives for Segmenting Histopathological Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2001.11202v3)** | 2020-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a new regularization method to train a fully convolutional network for semantic tissue segmentation in histopathological images. This method relies on the benefit of unsupervised learning, in the form of image reconstruction, for network training. To this end, it puts forward an idea of defining a new embedding that allows uniting the main supervised task of semantic segmentation and an auxiliary unsupervised task of image reconstruction into a single one and proposes to learn this united task by a single generative model. This embedding generates an output image by superimposing an input image on its segmentation map. Then, the method learns to translate the input image to this embedded output image using a conditional generative adversarial network, which is known as quite effective for image-to-image translations. This proposal is different than the existing approach that uses image reconstruction for the same regularization purpose. The existing approach considers segmentation and image reconstruction as two separate tasks in a multi-task network, defines their losses independently, and combines them in a joint loss function. However, the definition of such a function requires externally determining right contributions of the supervised and unsupervised losses that yield balanced learning between the segmentation and image reconstruction tasks. The proposed approach provides an easier solution to this problem by uniting these two tasks into a single one, which intrinsically combines their losses. We test our approach on three datasets of histopathological images. Our experiments demonstrate that it leads to better segmentation results in these datasets, compared to its counterparts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Image Segmentation Using Text and Image Prompts](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.10003v2)** | 2022-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation is usually addressed by training a model for a fixed set of object classes. Incorporating additional classes or more complex queries later is expensive as it requires re-training the model on a dataset that encompasses these expressions. Here we propose a system that can generate image segmentations based on arbitrary prompts at test time. A prompt can be either a text or an image. This approach enables us to create a unified model (trained once) for three common segmentation tasks, which come with distinct challenges: referring expression segmentation, zero-shot segmentation and one-shot segmentation. We build upon the CLIP model as a backbone which we extend with a transformer-based decoder that enables dense prediction. After training on an extended version of the PhraseCut dataset, our system generates a binary segmentation map for an image based on a free-text prompt or on an additional image expressing the query. We analyze different variants of the latter image-based prompts in detail. This novel hybrid input allows for dynamic adaptation not only to the three segmentation tasks mentioned above, but to any binary segmentation task where a text or image query can be formulated. Finally, we find our system to adapt well to generalized queries involving affordances or properties. Code is available at https://eckerlab.org/code/clipseg.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 |
| **[USE: Universal Segment Embeddings for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.05271v1)** | 2024-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The open-vocabulary image segmentation task involves partitioning images into semantically meaningful segments and classifying them with flexible text-defined categories. The recent vision-based foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown superior performance in generating class-agnostic image segments. The main challenge in open-vocabulary image segmentation now lies in accurately classifying these segments into text-defined categories. In this paper, we introduce the Universal Segment Embedding (USE) framework to address this challenge. This framework is comprised of two key components: 1) a data pipeline designed to efficiently curate a large amount of segment-text pairs at various granularities, and 2) a universal segment embedding model that enables precise segment classification into a vast range of text-defined categories. The USE model can not only help open-vocabulary image segmentation but also facilitate other downstream tasks (e.g., querying and ranking). Through comprehensive experimental studies on semantic segmentation and part segmentation benchmarks, we demonstrate that the USE framework outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary segmentation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual-hint Boundary to Segment Algorithm for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1010.0417v1)** | 2015-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation has been a very active research topic in image analysis area. Currently, most of the image segmentation algorithms are designed based on the idea that images are partitioned into a set of regions preserving homogeneous intra-regions and inhomogeneous inter-regions. However, human visual intuition does not always follow this pattern. A new image segmentation method named Visual-Hint Boundary to Segment (VHBS) is introduced, which is more consistent with human perceptions. VHBS abides by two visual hint rules based on human perceptions: (i) the global scale boundaries tend to be the real boundaries of the objects; (ii) two adjacent regions with quite different colors or textures tend to result in the real boundaries between them. It has been demonstrated by experiments that, compared with traditional image segmentation method, VHBS has better performance and also preserves higher computational efficiency.</p></details> | 45 pages |

| **[Segmentation Ability Map: Interpret deep features for medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.09206v1)** | 2022-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used for medical image segmentation. In most studies, only the output layer is exploited to compute the final segmentation results and the hidden representations of the deep learned features have not been well understood. In this paper, we propose a prototype segmentation (ProtoSeg) method to compute a binary segmentation map based on deep features. We measure the segmentation abilities of the features by computing the Dice between the feature segmentation map and ground-truth, named as the segmentation ability score (SA score for short). The corresponding SA score can quantify the segmentation abilities of deep features in different layers and units to understand the deep neural networks for segmentation. In addition, our method can provide a mean SA score which can give a performance estimation of the output on the test images without ground-truth. Finally, we use the proposed ProtoSeg method to compute the segmentation map directly on input images to further understand the segmentation ability of each input image. Results are presented on segmenting tumors in brain MRI, lesions in skin images, COVID-related abnormality in CT images, prostate segmentation in abdominal MRI, and pancreatic mass segmentation in CT images. Our method can provide new insights for interpreting and explainable AI systems for medical image segmentation.

| **[Instance Segmentation as Image Segmentation Annotation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.05498v1)** | 2019-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The instance segmentation problem intends to precisely detect and delineate objects in images. Most of the current solutions rely on deep convolutional neural networks but despite this fact proposed solutions are very diverse. Some solutions approach the problem as a network problem, where they use several networks or specialize a single network to solve several tasks. A different approach tries to solve the problem as an annotation problem, where the instance information is encoded in a mathematical representation. This work proposes a solution based in the DCME technique to solve the instance segmentation with a single segmentation network. Different from others, the segmentation network decoder is not specialized in a multi-task network. Instead, the network encoder is repurposed to classify image objects, reducing the computational cost of the solution.</p></details> |  |

| **[Nonparametric clustering for image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08345v1)** | 2021-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation aims at identifying regions of interest within an image, by grouping pixels according to their properties. This task resembles the statistical one of clustering, yet many standard clustering methods fail to meet the basic requirements of image segmentation: segment shapes are often biased toward predetermined shapes and their number is rarely determined automatically. Nonparametric clustering is, in principle, free from these limitations and turns out to be particularly suitable for the task of image segmentation. This is also witnessed by several operational analogies, as, for instance, the resort to topological data analysis and spatial tessellation in both the frameworks. We discuss the application of nonparametric clustering to image segmentation and provide an algorithm specific for this task. Pixel similarity is evaluated in terms of density of the color representation and the adjacency structure of the pixels is exploited to introduce a simple, yet effective method to identify image segments as disconnected high-density regions. The proposed method works both to segment an image and to detect its boundaries and can be seen as a generalization to color images of the class of thresholding methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysing Diffusion Segmentation for Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14440v1)** | 2024-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic models have become increasingly popular due to their ability to offer probabilistic modeling and generate diverse outputs. This versatility inspired their adaptation for image segmentation, where multiple predictions of the model can produce segmentation results that not only achieve high quality but also capture the uncertainty inherent in the model. Here, powerful architectures were proposed for improving diffusion segmentation performance. However, there is a notable lack of analysis and discussions on the differences between diffusion segmentation and image generation, and thorough evaluations are missing that distinguish the improvements these architectures provide for segmentation in general from their benefit for diffusion segmentation specifically. In this work, we critically analyse and discuss how diffusion segmentation for medical images differs from diffusion image generation, with a particular focus on the training behavior. Furthermore, we conduct an assessment how proposed diffusion segmentation architectures perform when trained directly for segmentation. Lastly, we explore how different medical segmentation tasks influence the diffusion segmentation behavior and the diffusion process could be adapted accordingly. With these analyses, we aim to provide in-depth insights into the behavior of diffusion segmentation that allow for a better design and evaluation of diffusion segmentation methods in the future.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Resolution Selection for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.06820v1)** | 2016-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well-known in image processing that computational cost increases rapidly with the number and dimensions of the images to be processed. Several fields, such as medical imaging, routinely use numerous very large images, which might also be 3D and/or captured at several frequency bands, all adding to the computational expense. Multiresolution analysis is a method of increasing the efficiency of the segmentation process. One multiresolution approach is the coarse-to-fine segmentation strategy, whereby the segmentation starts at a coarse resolution and is then fine-tuned during subsequent steps. The starting resolution for segmentation is generally selected arbitrarily with no clear selection criteria. The research reported in this paper showed that starting from different resolutions for image segmentation results in different accuracies and computational times, even for images of the same category (depicting similar scenes or objects). An automated method for resolution selection for an input image would thus be beneficial. This paper introduces a framework for the automated selection of the best resolution for image segmentation. We propose a measure for defining the best resolution based on user/system criteria, offering a trade-off between accuracy and computation time. A learning approach is then introduced for the selection of the resolution, whereby extracted image features are mapped to the previously determined best resolution. In the learning process, class (i.e., resolution) distribution is generally imbalanced, making effective learning from the data difficult. Experiments conducted with three datasets using two different segmentation algorithms show that the resolutions selected through learning enable much faster segmentation than the original ones, while retaining at least the original accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Segmentation with Multidimensional Refinement Indicators](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.2292v3)** | 2011-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We transpose an optimal control technique to the image segmentation problem. The idea is to consider image segmentation as a parameter estimation problem. The parameter to estimate is the color of the pixels of the image. We use the adaptive parameterization technique which builds iteratively an optimal representation of the parameter into uniform regions that form a partition of the domain, hence corresponding to a segmentation of the image. We minimize an error function during the iterations, and the partition of the image into regions is optimally driven by the gradient of this error. The resulting segmentation algorithm inherits desirable properties from its optimal control origin: soundness, robustness, and flexibility.</p></details> |  |

This approach, based on watershed, is composed of a spectral classification to obtain the markers and a vectorial gradient which gives the spatial information. Several alternative gradients are adapted to the different hyperspectral functions. Data reduction is performed either by Factor Analysis or by model fitting. Image segmentation is done on different spaces: factor space, parameters space, etc. On all these spaces the spatial/spectral segmentation approach is applied, leading to relevant results on the image.</p></details> |  |
| **[Segment Anything in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12306v3)** | 2024-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a critical component in clinical practice, facilitating accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, existing methods, often tailored to specific modalities or disease types, lack generalizability across the diverse spectrum of medical image segmentation tasks. Here we present MedSAM, a foundation model designed for bridging this gap by enabling universal medical image segmentation. The model is developed on a large-scale medical image dataset with 1,570,263 image-mask pairs, covering 10 imaging modalities and over 30 cancer types. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 86 internal validation tasks and 60 external validation tasks, demonstrating better accuracy and robustness than modality-wise specialist models. By delivering accurate and efficient segmentation across a wide spectrum of tasks, MedSAM holds significant potential to expedite the evolution of diagnostic tools and the personalization of treatment plans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Image Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.13978v3)** | 2021-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation models trained on public datasets have achieved great success in recent years. However, these models didn't consider the personalization issue of segmentation though it is important in practice. In this paper, we address the problem of personalized image segmentation. The objective is to generate more accurate segmentation results on unlabeled personalized images by investigating the data's personalized traits. To open up future research in this area, we collect a large dataset containing various users' personalized images called PIS (Personalized Image Semantic Segmentation). We also survey some recent researches related to this problem and report their performance on our dataset. Furthermore, by observing the correlation among a user's personalized images, we propose a baseline method that incorporates the inter-image context when segmenting certain images. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms the existing methods on the proposed dataset. The code and the PIS dataset will be made publicly available.</p></details> | appeared at ICCV2021 |
| **[Adaptive Noise-Tolerant Network for Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07163v2)** | 2025-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike image classification and annotation, for which deep network models have achieved dominating superior performances compared to traditional computer vision algorithms, deep learning for automatic image segmentation still faces critical challenges. One of such hurdles is to obtain ground-truth segmentations as the training labels for deep network training. Especially when we study biomedical images, such as histopathological images (histo-images), it is unrealistic to ask for manual segmentation labels as the ground truth for training due to the fine image resolution as well as the large image size and complexity. In this paper, instead of relying on clean segmentation labels, we study whether and how integrating imperfect or noisy segmentation results from off-the-shelf segmentation algorithms may help achieve better segmentation results through a new Adaptive Noise-Tolerant Network (ANTN) model. We extend the noisy label deep learning to image segmentation with two novel aspects: (1) multiple noisy labels can be integrated into one deep learning model; (2) noisy segmentation modeling, including probabilistic parameters, is adaptive, depending on the given testing image appearance. Implementation of the new ANTN model on both the synthetic data and real-world histo-images demonstrates its effectiveness and superiority over off-the-shelf and other existing deep-learning-based image segmentation algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exemplar Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01713v2)** | 2022-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image annotation typically requires expert knowledge and hence incurs time-consuming and expensive data annotation costs. To alleviate this burden, we propose a novel learning scenario, Exemplar Learning (EL), to explore automated learning processes for medical image segmentation with a single annotated image example. This innovative learning task is particularly suitable for medical image segmentation, where all categories of organs can be presented in one single image and annotated all at once. To address this challenging EL task, we propose an Exemplar Learning-based Synthesis Net (ELSNet) framework for medical image segmentation that enables innovative exemplar-based data synthesis, pixel-prototype based contrastive embedding learning, and pseudo-label based exploitation of the unlabeled data. Specifically, ELSNet introduces two new modules for image segmentation: an exemplar-guided synthesis module, which enriches and diversifies the training set by synthesizing annotated samples from the given exemplar, and a pixel-prototype based contrastive embedding module, which enhances the discriminative capacity of the base segmentation model via contrastive representation learning. Moreover, we deploy a two-stage process for segmentation model training, which exploits the unlabeled data with predicted pseudo segmentation labels. To evaluate this new learning framework, we conduct extensive experiments on several organ segmentation datasets and present an in-depth analysis. The empirical results show that the proposed exemplar learning framework produces effective segmentation results.</p></details> | BMVC 2022 |
| **[Image-free single-pixel segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10617v1)** | 2021-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existing segmentation techniques require high-fidelity images as input to perform semantic segmentation. Since the segmentation results contain most of edge information that is much less than the acquired images, the throughput gap leads to both hardware and software waste. In this letter, we report an image-free single-pixel segmentation technique. The technique combines structured illumination and single-pixel detection together, to efficiently samples and multiplexes scene's segmentation information into compressed one-dimensional measurements. The illumination patterns are optimized together with the subsequent reconstruction neural network, which directly infers segmentation maps from the single-pixel measurements. The end-to-end encoding-and-decoding learning framework enables optimized illumination with corresponding network, which provides both high acquisition and segmentation efficiency. Both simulation and experimental results validate that accurate segmentation can be achieved using two-order-of-magnitude less input data. When the sampling ratio is 1%, the Dice coefficient reaches above 80% and the pixel accuracy reaches above 96%. We envision that this image-free segmentation technique can be widely applied in various resource-limited platforms such as UAV and unmanned vehicle that require real-time sensing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locate then Segment: A Strong Pipeline for Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.16284v1)** | 2021-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring image segmentation aims to segment the objects referred by a natural language expression. Previous methods usually focus on designing an implicit and recurrent feature interaction mechanism to fuse the visual-linguistic features to directly generate the final segmentation mask without explicitly modeling the localization information of the referent instances. To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective by decoupling it into a "Locate-Then-Segment" (LTS) scheme. Given a language expression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding target image regions, then generate a fine segmentation mask about the object based on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual features to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model interaction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a light-weight segmentation network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly effective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+ and +3.4% on RefCOCOg). In addition, our model is more interpretable with explicitly locating the object, which is also proved by visualization experiments. We believe this framework is promising to serve as a strong baseline for referring image segmentation.</p></details> | CVPR 2021 |
| **[Maximin affinity learning of image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.5372v1)** | 2009-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Images can be segmented by first using a classifier to predict an affinity graph that reflects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the affinity classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassification rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the affinity graph. We present the first machine learning algorithm for training a classifier to produce affinity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classification of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of finding the connected components of the thresholded affinity graph, we are able to train an affinity classifier to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin affinities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Instance Segmentation from Semantic Image Segmentation Masks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.00949v4)** | 2024-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, instance segmentation has garnered significant attention across various applications. However, training a fully-supervised instance segmentation model requires costly both instance-level and pixel-level annotations. In contrast, weakly-supervised instance segmentation methods, such as those using image-level class labels or point labels, often struggle to satisfy the accuracy and recall requirements of practical scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel paradigm called Synthetic Instance Segmentation (SISeg). SISeg achieves instance segmentation results by leveraging image masks generated by existing semantic segmentation models, and it is highly efficient as we do not require additional training for semantic segmentation or the use of instance-level image annotations. In other words, the proposed model does not need extra manpower or higher computational expenses. Specifically, we first obtain a semantic segmentation mask of the input image via an existent semantic segmentation model. Then, we calculate a displacement field vector for each pixel based on the segmentation mask, which can indicate representations belonging to the same class but different instances, i.e., obtaining the instance-level object information. Finally, the instance segmentation results are refined by a learnable category-agnostic object boundary branch. Extensive experimental results on two challenging datasets highlight the effectiveness of SISeg in achieving competitive results when compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially fully-supervised methods. The code will be released at: SISeg</p></details> | 12 pages,4 figures |

The retinal vessel segmentation in OCTA images is still an open problem, and especially the thin and dense structure of the capillary plexus is an important challenge of this problem. In this work, we propose a novel image magnification network (IMN) for vessel segmentation in OCTA images. Contrary to the U-Net structure with a down-sampling encoder and up-sampling decoder, the proposed IMN adopts the design of up-sampling encoding and then down-sampling decoding. This design is to capture more low-level image details to reduce the omission of small structures. The experimental results on three open OCTA datasets show that the proposed IMN with an average dice score of 90.2% achieves the best performance in vessel segmentation of OCTA images. Besides, we also demonstrate the superior performance of IMN in cross-field image vessel segmentation and vessel skeleton extraction.</p></details> |  |

SAM was trained using 11 million images with over 1 billion masks and can produce segmentation results for a wide range of objects in natural scene images. SAM can be viewed as a general perception model for segmentation (partitioning images into semantically meaningful regions). Thus, how to utilize such a large foundation model for medical image segmentation is an emerging research target. This paper shows that although SAM does not immediately give high-quality segmentation for medical image data, its generated masks, features, and stability scores are useful for building and training better medical image segmentation models. In particular, we demonstrate how to use SAM to augment image input for commonly-used medical image segmentation models (e.g., U-Net). Experiments on three segmentation tasks show the effectiveness of our proposed SAMAug method.

| **[ARGenSeg: Image Segmentation with Autoregressive Image Generation Model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20803v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple segmentation datasets with a remarkable boost in inference speed, while maintaining strong understanding capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025, 18 pages</p></details> |

Different from the previous methods, SAMed is built upon the large-scale image segmentation model, Segment Anything Model (SAM), to explore the new research paradigm of customizing large-scale models for medical image segmentation. SAMed applies the low-rank-based (LoRA) finetuning strategy to the SAM image encoder and finetunes it together with the prompt encoder and the mask decoder on labeled medical image segmentation datasets. We also observe the warmup finetuning strategy and the AdamW optimizer lead SAMed to successful convergence and lower loss. Different from SAM, SAMed could perform semantic segmentation on medical images. Our trained SAMed model achieves 81.88 DSC and 20.64 HD on the Synapse multi-organ segmentation dataset, which is on par with the state-of-the-art methods. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our design. Since SAMed only updates a small fraction of the SAM parameters, its deployment cost and storage cost are quite marginal in practical usage.

| **[SSEGEP: Small SEGment Emphasized Performance evaluation metric for medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.03435v1)** | 2021-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic image segmentation is a critical component of medical image analysis, and hence quantifying segmentation performance is crucial. Challenges in medical image segmentation are mainly due to spatial variations of regions to be segmented and imbalance in distribution of classes. Commonly used metrics treat all detected pixels, indiscriminately. However, pixels in smaller segments must be treated differently from pixels in larger segments, as detection of smaller ones aid in early treatment of associated disease and are also easier to miss. To address this, we propose a novel evaluation metric for segmentation performance, emphasizing smaller segments, by assigning higher weightage to smaller segment pixels. Weighted false positives are also considered in deriving the new metric named, "SSEGEP"(Small SEGment Emphasized Performance evaluation metric), (range : 0(Bad) to 1(Good)). The experiments were performed on diverse anatomies(eye, liver, pancreas and breast) from publicly available datasets to show applicability of the proposed metric across different imaging techniques. Mean opinion score (MOS) and statistical significance testing is used to quantify the relevance of proposed approach. Across 33 fundus images, where the largest exudate is 1.41%, and the smallest is 0.0002% of the image, the proposed metric is 30% closer to MOS, as compared to Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Statistical significance testing resulted in promising p-value of order 10^{-18} with SSEGEP for hepatic tumor compared to DSC. The proposed metric is found to perform better for the images having multiple segments for a single label.</p></details> |  |

| **[Detecting the unknown in Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.11641v1)** | 2022-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection methods have witnessed impressive improvements in the last years thanks to the design of novel neural network architectures and the availability of large scale datasets. However, current methods have a significant limitation: they are able to detect only the classes observed during training time, that are only a subset of all the classes that a detector may encounter in the real world. Furthermore, the presence of unknown classes is often not considered at training time, resulting in methods not even able to detect that an unknown object is present in the image. In this work, we address the problem of detecting unknown objects, known as open-set object detection. We propose a novel training strategy, called UNKAD, able to predict unknown objects without requiring any annotation of them, exploiting non annotated objects that are already present in the background of training images. In particular, exploiting the four-steps training strategy of Faster R-CNN, UNKAD first identifies and pseudo-labels unknown objects and then uses the pseudo-annotations to train an additional unknown class. While UNKAD can directly detect unknown objects, we further combine it with previous unknown detection techniques, showing that it improves their performance at no costs.</p></details> |  |

With the advent of deep learning techniques, the accuracy of object detection has increased significantly. The project aims to integrate a modern technique for object detection with the aim of achieving high accuracy with real-time performance. The reliance on other computer vision algorithms in many object identification systems, which results in poor and ineffective performance, is a significant obstacle. In this research, we solve the end-to-end object detection problem entirely using deep learning techniques. The network is trained using the most difficult publicly available dataset, which is used for an annual item detection challenge. Applications that need object detection can benefit the system's quick and precise finding.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Object-fabrication Targeted Attack for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06431v3)** | 2024-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that object detection networks are usually vulnerable to adversarial examples. Generally, adversarial attacks for object detection can be categorized into targeted and untargeted attacks. Compared with untargeted attacks, targeted attacks present greater challenges and all existing targeted attack methods launch the attack by misleading detectors to mislabel the detected object as a specific wrong label. However, since these methods must depend on the presence of the detected objects within the victim image, they suffer from limitations in attack scenarios and attack success rates. In this paper, we propose a targeted feature space attack method that can mislead detectors to `fabricate' extra designated objects regardless of whether the victim image contains objects or not. Specifically, we introduce a guided image to extract coarse-grained features of the target objects and design an innovative dual attention mechanism to filter out the critical features of the target objects efficiently. The attack performance of the proposed method is evaluated on MS COCO and BDD100K datasets with FasterRCNN and YOLOv5. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed targeted feature space attack method shows significant improvements in terms of image-specific, universality, and generalization attack performance, compared with the previous targeted attack for object detection.</p></details> |  |

Probabilistic object detection is a new variation on traditional object detection tasks, requiring estimates of spatial and semantic uncertainty. We extend the traditional bounding box format of object detection to express spatial uncertainty using gaussian distributions for the box corners. The challenge introduces a new test dataset of video sequences, which are designed to more closely resemble the kind of data available to a robotic system. We evaluate probabilistic detections using a new probability-based detection quality (PDQ) measure. The goal in creating this challenge is to draw the computer and robotic vision communities together, toward applying object detection solutions for practical robotics applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, workshop paper</p></details> |
| **[Scalable Object Detection for Stylized Objects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.09822v2)** | 2017-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Following recent breakthroughs in convolutional neural networks and monolithic model architectures, state-of-the-art object detection models can reliably and accurately scale into the realm of up to thousands of classes. Things quickly break down, however, when scaling into the tens of thousands, or, eventually, to millions or billions of unique objects. Further, bounding box-trained end-to-end models require extensive training data. Even though - with some tricks using hierarchies - one can sometimes scale up to thousands of classes, the labor requirements for clean image annotations quickly get out of control. In this paper, we present a two-layer object detection method for brand logos and other stylized objects for which prototypical images exist. It can scale to large numbers of unique classes. Our first layer is a CNN from the Single Shot Multibox Detector family of models that learns to propose regions where some stylized object is likely to appear. The contents of a proposed bounding box is then run against an image index that is targeted for the retrieval task at hand. The proposed architecture scales to a large number of object classes, allows to continously add new classes without retraining, and exhibits state-of-the-art quality on a stylized object detection task such as logo recognition.</p></details> | 9 pages, 7 figures |
| **[PROB: Probabilistic Objectness for Open World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01424v1)** | 2022-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open World Object Detection (OWOD) is a new and challenging computer vision task that bridges the gap between classic object detection (OD) benchmarks and object detection in the real world. In addition to detecting and classifying seen/labeled objects, OWOD algorithms are expected to detect novel/unknown objects - which can be classified and incrementally learned. In standard OD, object proposals not overlapping with a labeled object are automatically classified as background. Therefore, simply applying OD methods to OWOD fails as unknown objects would be predicted as background. The challenge of detecting unknown objects stems from the lack of supervision in distinguishing unknown objects and background object proposals. Previous OWOD methods have attempted to overcome this issue by generating supervision using pseudo-labeling - however, unknown object detection has remained low. Probabilistic/generative models may provide a solution for this challenge. Herein, we introduce a novel probabilistic framework for objectness estimation, where we alternate between probability distribution estimation and objectness likelihood maximization of known objects in the embedded feature space - ultimately allowing us to estimate the objectness probability of different proposals. The resulting Probabilistic Objectness transformer-based open-world detector, PROB, integrates our framework into traditional object detection models, adapting them for the open-world setting. Comprehensive experiments on OWOD benchmarks show that PROB outperforms all existing OWOD methods in both unknown object detection ($\sim 2\times$ unknown recall) and known object detection ($\sim 10\%$ mAP). Our code will be made available upon publication at https://github.com/orrzohar/PROB.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detective: An Attentive Recurrent Model for Sparse Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.12197v1)** | 2020-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present Detective - an attentive object detector that identifies objects in images in a sequential manner. Our network is based on an encoder-decoder architecture, where the encoder is a convolutional neural network, and the decoder is a convolutional recurrent neural network coupled with an attention mechanism. At each iteration, our decoder focuses on the relevant parts of the image using an attention mechanism, and then estimates the object's class and the bounding box coordinates. Current object detection models generate dense predictions and rely on post-processing to remove duplicate predictions. Detective is a sparse object detector that generates a single bounding box per object instance. However, training a sparse object detector is challenging, as it requires the model to reason at the instance level and not just at the class and spatial levels. We propose a training mechanism based on the Hungarian algorithm and a loss that balances the localization and classification tasks. This allows Detective to achieve promising results on the PASCAL VOC object detection dataset. Our experiments demonstrate that sparse object detection is possible and has a great potential for future developments in applications where the order of the objects to be predicted is of interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Recognition of Unknown Objects for Open-World Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.16527v1)** | 2023-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) extends object detection problem to a realistic and dynamic scenario, where a detection model is required to be capable of detecting both known and unknown objects and incrementally learning newly introduced knowledge. Current OWOD models, such as ORE and OW-DETR, focus on pseudo-labeling regions with high objectness scores as unknowns, whose performance relies heavily on the supervision of known objects. While they can detect the unknowns that exhibit similar features to the known objects, they suffer from a severe label bias problem that they tend to detect all regions (including unknown object regions) that are dissimilar to the known objects as part of the background. To eliminate the label bias, this paper proposes a novel approach that learns an unsupervised discriminative model to recognize true unknown objects from raw pseudo labels generated by unsupervised region proposal methods. The resulting model can be further refined by a classification-free self-training method which iteratively extends pseudo unknown objects to the unlabeled regions. Experimental results show that our method 1) significantly outperforms the prior SOTA in detecting unknown objects while maintaining competitive performance of detecting known object classes on the MS COCO dataset, and 2) achieves better generalization ability on the LVIS and Objects365 datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Out-of-Distribution Detection for LiDAR-based 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.14435v1)** | 2022-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object detection is an essential part of automated driving, and deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance for this task. However, deep models are notorious for assigning high confidence scores to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs, that is, inputs that are not drawn from the training distribution. Detecting OOD inputs is challenging and essential for the safe deployment of models. OOD detection has been studied extensively for the classification task, but it has not received enough attention for the object detection task, specifically LiDAR-based 3D object detection. In this paper, we focus on the detection of OOD inputs for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. We formulate what OOD inputs mean for object detection and propose to adapt several OOD detection methods for object detection. We accomplish this by our proposed feature extraction method. To evaluate OOD detection methods, we develop a simple but effective technique of generating OOD objects for a given object detection model. Our evaluation based on the KITTI dataset shows that different OOD detection methods have biases toward detecting specific OOD objects. It emphasizes the importance of combined OOD detection methods and more research in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ITSC 2022</p></details> |
| **[Slender Object Detection: Diagnoses and Improvements](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08529v4)** | 2021-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we are concerned with the detection of a particular type of objects with extreme aspect ratios, namely \textbf{slender objects}. In real-world scenarios, slender objects are actually very common and crucial to the objective of a detection system. However, this type of objects has been largely overlooked by previous object detection algorithms. Upon our investigation, for a classical object detection method, a drastic drop of $18.9\%$ mAP on COCO is observed, if solely evaluated on slender objects. Therefore, we systematically study the problem of slender object detection in this work. Accordingly, an analytical framework with carefully designed benchmark and evaluation protocols is established, in which different algorithms and modules can be inspected and compared. \New Our study reveals that effective slender object detection can be achieved ~\textbf{with none of} (1) anchor-based localization; (2) specially designed box representations. Instead, \textbf{the critical aspect of improving slender object detection is feature adaptation}. It identifies and extends the insights of existing methods that are previously underexploited. Furthermore, we propose a feature adaption strategy that achieves clear and consistent improvements over current representative object detection methods.</p></details> |  |

Let us tell you such a recipe. It is surprisingly simple: train your detector for an extra 12 epochs using cyclical learning rates and then average these 12 checkpoints as your final detection model}. This potent recipe is inspired by Stochastic Weights Averaging (SWA), which is proposed in arXiv:1803.05407 for improving generalization in deep neural networks. We found it also very effective in object detection. In this technique report, we systematically investigate the effects of applying SWA to object detection as well as instance segmentation. Through extensive experiments, we discover the aforementioned workable policy of performing SWA in object detection, and we consistently achieve $\sim$1.0 AP improvement over various popular detectors on the challenging COCO benchmark, including Mask RCNN, Faster RCNN, RetinaNet, FCOS, YOLOv3 and VFNet. We hope this work will make more researchers in object detection know this technique and help them train better object detectors.

| **[Class-agnostic Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.14204v1)** | 2020-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models perform well at localizing and classifying objects that they are shown during training. However, due to the difficulty and cost associated with creating and annotating detection datasets, trained models detect a limited number of object types with unknown objects treated as background content. This hinders the adoption of conventional detectors in real-world applications like large-scale object matching, visual grounding, visual relation prediction, obstacle detection (where it is more important to determine the presence and location of objects than to find specific types), etc. We propose class-agnostic object detection as a new problem that focuses on detecting objects irrespective of their object-classes. Specifically, the goal is to predict bounding boxes for all objects in an image but not their object-classes. The predicted boxes can then be consumed by another system to perform application-specific classification, retrieval, etc. We propose training and evaluation protocols for benchmarking class-agnostic detectors to advance future research in this domain. Finally, we propose (1) baseline methods and (2) a new adversarial learning framework for class-agnostic detection that forces the model to exclude class-specific information from features used for predictions. Experimental results show that adversarial learning improves class-agnostic detection efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of WACV 2021</p></details> |
| **[Relation Networks for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.11575v2)** | 2018-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although it is well believed for years that modeling relations between objects would help object recognition, there has not been evidence that the idea is working in the deep learning era. All state-of-the-art object detection systems still rely on recognizing object instances individually, without exploiting their relations during learning. This work proposes an object relation module. It processes a set of objects simultaneously through interaction between their appearance feature and geometry, thus allowing modeling of their relations. It is lightweight and in-place. It does not require additional supervision and is easy to embed in existing networks. It is shown effective on improving object recognition and duplicate removal steps in the modern object detection pipeline. It verifies the efficacy of modeling object relations in CNN based detection. It gives rise to the first fully end-to-end object detector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Object Instance Mining for Weakly Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.01087v1)** | 2020-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised object detection (WSOD) using only image-level annotations has attracted growing attention over the past few years. Existing approaches using multiple instance learning easily fall into local optima, because such mechanism tends to learn from the most discriminative object in an image for each category. Therefore, these methods suffer from missing object instances which degrade the performance of WSOD. To address this problem, this paper introduces an end-to-end object instance mining (OIM) framework for weakly supervised object detection. OIM attempts to detect all possible object instances existing in each image by introducing information propagation on the spatial and appearance graphs, without any additional annotations. During the iterative learning process, the less discriminative object instances from the same class can be gradually detected and utilized for training. In addition, we design an object instance reweighted loss to learn larger portion of each object instance to further improve the performance. The experimental results on two publicly available databases, VOC 2007 and 2012, demonstrate the efficacy of proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detect-and-describe: Joint learning framework for detection and description of objects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.08828v1)** | 2022-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional object detection answers two questions; "what" (what the object is?) and "where" (where the object is?). "what" part of the object detection can be fine-grained further i.e. "what type", "what shape" and "what material" etc. This results in the shifting of the object detection tasks to the object description paradigm. Describing an object provides additional detail that enables us to understand the characteristics and attributes of the object ("plastic boat" not just boat, "glass bottle" not just bottle). This additional information can implicitly be used to gain insight into unseen objects (e.g. unknown object is "metallic", "has wheels"), which is not possible in traditional object detection. In this paper, we present a new approach to simultaneously detect objects and infer their attributes, we call it Detect and Describe (DaD) framework. DaD is a deep learning-based approach that extends object detection to object attribute prediction as well. We train our model on aPascal train set and evaluate our approach on aPascal test set. We achieve 97.0% in Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) for object attributes prediction on aPascal test set. We also show qualitative results for object attribute prediction on unseen objects, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for describing unknown objects.</p></details> |  |

The only preliminary research treats them as two contradictory tasks, training models on large-scale labeled data alternately for each task and assessing them independently. However, such task-specific mechanisms fail to meet real-world demands for addressing unknown tasks effectively. To address this issue, in this paper, we pioneer a task-agnostic framework to unify SOD and COD. To this end, inspired by the agreeable nature of binary segmentation for SOD and COD, we propose a Contrastive Distillation Paradigm (CDP) to distil the foreground from the background, facilitating the identification of salient and camouflaged objects amidst their surroundings. To probe into the contribution of our CDP, we design a simple yet effective contextual decoder involving the interval-layer and global context, which achieves an inference speed of 67 fps. Besides the supervised setting, our CDP can be seamlessly integrated into unsupervised settings, eliminating the reliance on extensive human annotations. Experiments on public SOD and COD datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework in both supervised and unsupervised settings, compared with existing state-of-the-art approaches.

| **[Probabilistic Object Detection: Definition and Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.10800v4)** | 2020-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Probabilistic Object Detection, the task of detecting objects in images and accurately quantifying the spatial and semantic uncertainties of the detections. Given the lack of methods capable of assessing such probabilistic object detections, we present the new Probability-based Detection Quality measure (PDQ).Unlike AP-based measures, PDQ has no arbitrary thresholds and rewards spatial and label quality, and foreground/background separation quality while explicitly penalising false positive and false negative detections. We contrast PDQ with existing mAP and moLRP measures by evaluating state-of-the-art detectors and a Bayesian object detector based on Monte Carlo Dropout. Our experiments indicate that conventional object detectors tend to be spatially overconfident and thus perform poorly on the task of probabilistic object detection. Our paper aims to encourage the development of new object detection approaches that provide detections with accurately estimated spatial and label uncertainties and are of critical importance for deployment on robots and embodied AI systems in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 25 figures, to appear in the proceedings of the winter conference on applications of computer vision WACV 2020</p></details> |
| **[Test-Time Backdoor Detection for Object Detection Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15293v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks, where attackers poison a small subset of training samples by embedding a predefined trigger to manipulate prediction. Detecting poisoned samples (i.e., those containing triggers) at test time can prevent backdoor activation. However, unlike image classification tasks, the unique characteristics of object detection -- particularly its output of numerous objects -- pose fresh challenges for backdoor detection. The complex attack effects (e.g., "ghost" object emergence or "vanishing" object) further render current defenses fundamentally inadequate. To this end, we design TRAnsformation Consistency Evaluation (TRACE), a brand-new method for detecting poisoned samples at test time in object detection. Our journey begins with two intriguing observations: (1) poisoned samples exhibit significantly more consistent detection results than clean ones across varied backgrounds. (2) clean samples show higher detection consistency when introduced to different focal information. Based on these phenomena, TRACE applies foreground and background transformations to each test sample, then assesses transformation consistency by calculating the variance in objects confidences. TRACE achieves black-box, universal backdoor detection, with extensive experiments showing a 30% improvement in AUROC over state-of-the-art defenses and resistance to adaptive attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

When recognizing and localizing key objects from sparse 3D inputs, autonomous vehicles suffer from a larger continuous searching space and higher fore-background imbalance compared to image-based object detection. In this paper, we aim to solve this fore-background imbalance in 3D object detection. Inspired by the recent use of focal loss in image-based object detection, we extend this hard-mining improvement of binary cross entropy to point-cloud-based object detection and conduct experiments to show its performance based on two different 3D detectors: 3D-FCN and VoxelNet. The evaluation results show up to 11.2AP gains through the focal loss in a wide range of hyperparameters for 3D object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE RA-L 2019 to appear.

While many models have been proposed and several applications have emerged, a deep understanding of achievements and issues remains lacking. We aim to provide a comprehensive review of recent progress in salient object detection and situate this field among other closely related areas such as generic scene segmentation, object proposal generation, and saliency for fixation prediction. Covering 228 publications, we survey i) roots, key concepts, and tasks, ii) core techniques and main modeling trends, and iii) datasets and evaluation metrics for salient object detection. We also discuss open problems such as evaluation metrics and dataset bias in model performance, and suggest future research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Focus-and-Detect: A Small Object Detection Framework for Aerial Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.12976v1)** | 2022-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, object detection in aerial images is still a challenging task. Specific problems in aerial images makes the detection problem harder, such as small objects, densely packed objects, objects in different sizes and with different orientations. To address small object detection problem, we propose a two-stage object detection framework called "Focus-and-Detect". The first stage which consists of an object detector network supervised by a Gaussian Mixture Model, generates clusters of objects constituting the focused regions. The second stage, which is also an object detector network, predicts objects within the focal regions. Incomplete Box Suppression (IBS) method is also proposed to overcome the truncation effect of region search approach. Results indicate that the proposed two-stage framework achieves an AP score of 42.06 on VisDrone validation dataset, surpassing all other state-of-the-art small object detection methods reported in the literature, to the best of authors' knowledge.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Described Object Detection: Liberating Object Detection with Flexible Expressions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.12813v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting objects based on language information is a popular task that includes Open-Vocabulary object Detection (OVD) and Referring Expression Comprehension (REC). In this paper, we advance them to a more practical setting called Described Object Detection (DOD) by expanding category names to flexible language expressions for OVD and overcoming the limitation of REC only grounding the pre-existing object. We establish the research foundation for DOD by constructing a Description Detection Dataset ($D^3$). This dataset features flexible language expressions, whether short category names or long descriptions, and annotating all described objects on all images without omission. By evaluating previous SOTA methods on $D^3$, we find some troublemakers that fail current REC, OVD, and bi-functional methods. REC methods struggle with confidence scores, rejecting negative instances, and multi-target scenarios, while OVD methods face constraints with long and complex descriptions. Recent bi-functional methods also do not work well on DOD due to their separated training procedures and inference strategies for REC and OVD tasks. Building upon the aforementioned findings, we propose a baseline that largely improves REC methods by reconstructing the training data and introducing a binary classification sub-task, outperforming existing methods. Data and code are available at https://github.com/shikras/d-cube and related works are tracked in https://github.com/Charles-Xie/awesome-described-object-detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2023</p></details> |
| **[Towards Object Detection from Motion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.12950v1)** | 2019-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to weakly supervised object detection. Instead of annotated images, our method only requires two short videos to learn to detect a new object: 1) a video of a moving object and 2) one or more "negative" videos of the scene without the object. The key idea of our algorithm is to train the object detector to produce physically plausible object motion when applied to the first video and to not detect anything in the second video. With this approach, our method learns to locate objects without any object location annotations. Once the model is trained, it performs object detection on single images. We evaluate our method in three robotics settings that afford learning objects from motion: observing moving objects, watching demonstrations of object manipulation, and physically interacting with objects (see a video summary at https://youtu.be/BH0Hv3zZG_4).</p></details> |  |
| **[Concealed Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10274v2)** | 2024-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first systematic study on concealed object detection (COD), which aims to identify objects that are "perfectly" embedded in their background. The high intrinsic similarities between the concealed objects and their background make COD far more challenging than traditional object detection/segmentation. To better understand this task, we collect a large-scale dataset, called COD10K, which consists of 10,000 images covering concealed objects in diverse real-world scenarios from 78 object categories. Further, we provide rich annotations including object categories, object boundaries, challenging attributes, object-level labels, and instance-level annotations. Our COD10K is the largest COD dataset to date, with the richest annotations, which enables comprehensive concealed object understanding and can even be used to help progress several other vision tasks, such as detection, segmentation, classification, etc. Motivated by how animals hunt in the wild, we also design a simple but strong baseline for COD, termed the Search Identification Network (SINet). Without any bells and whistles, SINet outperforms 12 cutting-edge baselines on all datasets tested, making them robust, general architectures that could serve as catalysts for future research in COD. Finally, we provide some interesting findings and highlight several potential applications and future directions.

| **[3D Object Class Detection in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.05038v1)** | 2015-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object class detection has been a synonym for 2D bounding box localization for the longest time, fueled by the success of powerful statistical learning techniques, combined with robust image representations. Only recently, there has been a growing interest in revisiting the promise of computer vision from the early days: to precisely delineate the contents of a visual scene, object by object, in 3D. In this paper, we draw from recent advances in object detection and 2D-3D object lifting in order to design an object class detector that is particularly tailored towards 3D object class detection. Our 3D object class detection method consists of several stages gradually enriching the object detection output with object viewpoint, keypoints and 3D shape estimates. Following careful design, in each stage it constantly improves the performance and achieves state-ofthe-art performance in simultaneous 2D bounding box and viewpoint estimation on the challenging Pascal3D+ dataset.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring the Impact of Scene Level Objects on Object Detection: Towards Quantitative Explanations of Detection Decisions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.10790v1)** | 2024-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although accuracy and other common metrics can provide a useful window into the performance of an object detection model, they lack a deeper view of the model's decision process. Regardless of the quality of the training data and process, the features that an object detection model learns cannot be guaranteed. A model may learn a relationship between certain background context, i.e., scene level objects, and the presence of the labeled classes. Furthermore, standard performance verification and metrics would not identify this phenomenon. This paper presents a new black box explainability method for additional verification of object detection models by finding the impact of scene level objects on the identification of the objects within the image. By comparing the accuracies of a model on test data with and without certain scene level objects, the contributions of these objects to the model's performance becomes clearer. The experiment presented here will assess the impact of buildings and people in image context on the detection of emergency road vehicles by a fine-tuned YOLOv8 model. A large increase in accuracy in the presence of a scene level object will indicate the model's reliance on that object to make its detections. The results of this research lead to providing a quantitative explanation of the object detection model's decision process, enabling a deeper understanding of the model's performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Supervised Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.15056v2)** | 2020-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After learning a new object category from image-level annotations (with no object bounding boxes), humans are remarkably good at precisely localizing those objects. However, building good object localizers (i.e., detectors) currently requires expensive instance-level annotations. While some work has been done on learning detectors from weakly labeled samples (with only class labels), these detectors do poorly at localization. In this work, we show how to build better object detectors from weakly labeled images of new categories by leveraging knowledge learned from fully labeled base categories. We call this novel learning paradigm cross-supervised object detection. We propose a unified framework that combines a detection head trained from instance-level annotations and a recognition head learned from image-level annotations, together with a spatial correlation module that bridges the gap between detection and recognition. These contributions enable us to better detect novel objects with image-level annotations in complex multi-object scenes such as the COCO dataset.</p></details> |  |

The input of the system will be scene and output as audio. Alert facility is provided based on severity levels of the objects (snake, broke glass etc) and also during difficulties. The study proposed techniques to provide speedy detection of objects based on shapes and its scale. Features are extraction to have minimum spaces using dynamic scaling. From a scene, clusters of objects are formed based on the scale and shape. Searching is performed among the clusters initially based on the shape, scale, mean cluster value and index of object(s). The minimum operation to detect the possible shape of the object is performed. In case the object does not have a likely matching shape, scale etc, then the several operations required for an object detection will not perform; instead, it will declared as a new object. In such way, this study finds a speedy way of detecting objects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1210.7038 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[BadDet: Backdoor Attacks on Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.14497v1)** | 2022-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have been deployed in numerous real-world applications such as autonomous driving and surveillance. However, these models are vulnerable in adversarial environments. Backdoor attack is emerging as a severe security threat which injects a backdoor trigger into a small portion of training data such that the trained model behaves normally on benign inputs but gives incorrect predictions when the specific trigger appears. While most research in backdoor attacks focuses on image classification, backdoor attacks on object detection have not been explored but are of equal importance. Object detection has been adopted as an important module in various security-sensitive applications such as autonomous driving. Therefore, backdoor attacks on object detection could pose severe threats to human lives and properties. We propose four kinds of backdoor attacks for object detection task: 1) Object Generation Attack: a trigger can falsely generate an object of the target class; 2) Regional Misclassification Attack: a trigger can change the prediction of a surrounding object to the target class; 3) Global Misclassification Attack: a single trigger can change the predictions of all objects in an image to the target class; and 4) Object Disappearance Attack: a trigger can make the detector fail to detect the object of the target class. We develop appropriate metrics to evaluate the four backdoor attacks on object detection. We perform experiments using two typical object detection models -- Faster-RCNN and YOLOv3 on different datasets. More crucially, we demonstrate that even fine-tuning on another benign dataset cannot remove the backdoor hidden in the object detection model. To defend against these backdoor attacks, we propose Detector Cleanse, an entropy-based run-time detection framework to identify poisoned testing samples for any deployed object detector.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gaseous Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12415v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection, a fundamental and challenging problem in computer vision, has experienced rapid development due to the effectiveness of deep learning. The current objects to be detected are mostly rigid solid substances with apparent and distinct visual characteristics. In this paper, we endeavor on a scarcely explored task named Gaseous Object Detection (GOD), which is undertaken to explore whether the object detection techniques can be extended from solid substances to gaseous substances. Nevertheless, the gas exhibits significantly different visual characteristics: 1) saliency deficiency, 2) arbitrary and ever-changing shapes, 3) lack of distinct boundaries. To facilitate the study on this challenging task, we construct a GOD-Video dataset comprising 600 videos (141,017 frames) that cover various attributes with multiple types of gases. A comprehensive benchmark is established based on this dataset, allowing for a rigorous evaluation of frame-level and video-level detectors. Deduced from the Gaussian dispersion model, the physics-inspired Voxel Shift Field (VSF) is designed to model geometric irregularities and ever-changing shapes in potential 3D space. By integrating VSF into Faster RCNN, the VSF RCNN serves as a simple but strong baseline for gaseous object detection. Our work aims to attract further research into this valuable albeit challenging area.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (2024)</p></details> |

| **[Adaptive Objectness for Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1501.00909v1)** | 2016-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object tracking is a long standing problem in vision. While great efforts have been spent to improve tracking performance, a simple yet reliable prior knowledge is left unexploited: the target object in tracking must be an object other than non-object. The recently proposed and popularized objectness measure provides a natural way to model such prior in visual tracking. Thus motivated, in this paper we propose to adapt objectness for visual object tracking. Instead of directly applying an existing objectness measure that is generic and handles various objects and environments, we adapt it to be compatible to the specific tracking sequence and object. More specifically, we use the newly proposed BING objectness as the base, and then train an object-adaptive objectness for each tracking task. The training is implemented by using an adaptive support vector machine that integrates information from the specific tracking target into the BING measure. We emphasize that the benefit of the proposed adaptive objectness, named ADOBING, is generic. To show this, we combine ADOBING with seven top performed trackers in recent evaluations. We run the ADOBING-enhanced trackers with their base trackers on two popular benchmarks, the CVPR2013 benchmark (50 sequences) and the Princeton Tracking Benchmark (100 sequences). On both benchmarks, our methods not only consistently improve the base trackers, but also achieve the best known performances. Noting that the way we integrate objectness in visual tracking is generic and straightforward, we expect even more improvement by using tracker-specific objectness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Object Tracking with Siamese Track-RCNN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07786v1)** | 2020-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking systems often consist of a combination of a detector, a short term linker, a re-identification feature extractor and a solver that takes the output from these separate components and makes a final prediction. Differently, this work aims to unify all these in a single tracking system. Towards this, we propose Siamese Track-RCNN, a two stage detect-and-track framework which consists of three functional branches: (1) the detection branch localizes object instances; (2) the Siamese-based track branch estimates the object motion and (3) the object re-identification branch re-activates the previously terminated tracks when they re-emerge. We test our tracking system on two popular datasets of the MOTChallenge. Siamese Track-RCNN achieves significantly higher results than the state-of-the-art, while also being much more efficient, thanks to its unified design.</p></details> |  |
| **[Camouflaged Object Tracking: A Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13877v4)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tracking has seen remarkable advancements, largely driven by the availability of large-scale training datasets that have enabled the development of highly accurate and robust algorithms. While significant progress has been made in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such as tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which blend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique challenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge is particularly critical in applications such as military, security, agriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged objects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object Tracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for evaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200 sequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed bounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals significant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS, which demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for camouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable at https://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Tracking with Object Permanence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01288v4)** | 2024-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To reduce the expensive labor cost for manual labeling autonomous driving datasets, an alternative is to automatically label the datasets using an offline perception system. However, objects might be temporally occluded. Such occlusion scenarios in the datasets are common yet underexplored in offline auto labeling. In this work, we propose an offline tracking model that focuses on occluded object tracks. It leverages the concept of object permanence which means objects continue to exist even if they are not observed anymore. The model contains three parts: a standard online tracker, a re-identification (Re-ID) module that associates tracklets before and after occlusion, and a track completion module that completes the fragmented tracks. The Re-ID module and the track completion module use the vectorized map as one of the inputs to refine the tracking results with occlusion. The model can effectively recover the occluded object trajectories. It achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D multi-object tracking by significantly improving the original online tracking result, showing its potential to be applied in offline auto labeling as a useful plugin to improve tracking by recovering occlusions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2024).

| **[Transparent Object Tracking Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.10875v2)** | 2021-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tracking has achieved considerable progress in recent years. However, current research in the field mainly focuses on tracking of opaque objects, while little attention is paid to transparent object tracking. In this paper, we make the first attempt in exploring this problem by proposing a Transparent Object Tracking Benchmark (TOTB). Specifically, TOTB consists of 225 videos (86K frames) from 15 diverse transparent object categories. Each sequence is manually labeled with axis-aligned bounding boxes. To the best of our knowledge, TOTB is the first benchmark dedicated to transparent object tracking. In order to understand how existing trackers perform and to provide comparison for future research on TOTB, we extensively evaluate 25 state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. The evaluation results exhibit that more efforts are needed to improve transparent object tracking. Besides, we observe some nontrivial findings from the evaluation that are discrepant with some common beliefs in opaque object tracking. For example, we find that deeper features are not always good for improvements. Moreover, to encourage future research, we introduce a novel tracker, named TransATOM, which leverages transparency features for tracking and surpasses all 25 evaluated approaches by a large margin. By releasing TOTB, we expect to facilitate future research and application of transparent object tracking in both the academia and industry. The TOTB and evaluation results as well as TransATOM are available at https://hengfan2010.github.io/projects/TOTB.</p></details> | Tech. Report |
| **[Tracking and Understanding Object Transformations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04678v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world objects frequently undergo state transformations. From an apple being cut into pieces to a butterfly emerging from its cocoon, tracking through these changes is important for understanding real-world objects and dynamics. However, existing methods often lose track of the target object after transformation, due to significant changes in object appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce the task of Track Any State: tracking objects through transformations while detecting and describing state changes, accompanied by a new benchmark dataset, VOST-TAS. To tackle this problem, we present TubeletGraph, a zero-shot system that recovers missing objects after transformation and maps out how object states are evolving over time. TubeletGraph first identifies potentially overlooked tracks, and determines whether they should be integrated based on semantic and proximity priors. Then, it reasons about the added tracks and generates a state graph describing each observed transformation. TubeletGraph achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance under transformations, while demonstrating deeper understanding of object transformations and promising capabilities in temporal grounding and semantic reasoning for complex object transformations. Code, additional results, and the benchmark dataset are available at https://tubelet-graph.github.io.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

| **[OmniTracker: Unifying Object Tracking by Tracking-with-Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12079v1)** | 2023-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object tracking (OT) aims to estimate the positions of target objects in a video sequence. Depending on whether the initial states of target objects are specified by provided annotations in the first frame or the categories, OT could be classified as instance tracking (e.g., SOT and VOS) and category tracking (e.g., MOT, MOTS, and VIS) tasks. Combing the advantages of the best practices developed in both communities, we propose a novel tracking-with-detection paradigm, where tracking supplements appearance priors for detection and detection provides tracking with candidate bounding boxes for association. Equipped with such a design, a unified tracking model, OmniTracker, is further presented to resolve all the tracking tasks with a fully shared network architecture, model weights, and inference pipeline. Extensive experiments on 7 tracking datasets, including LaSOT, TrackingNet, DAVIS16-17, MOT17, MOTS20, and YTVIS19, demonstrate that OmniTracker achieves on-par or even better results than both task-specific and unified tracking models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Track with Object Permanence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.14258v2)** | 2021-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking by detection, the dominant approach for online multi-object tracking, alternates between localization and association steps. As a result, it strongly depends on the quality of instantaneous observations, often failing when objects are not fully visible. In contrast, tracking in humans is underlined by the notion of object permanence: once an object is recognized, we are aware of its physical existence and can approximately localize it even under full occlusions. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end trainable approach for joint object detection and tracking that is capable of such reasoning. We build on top of the recent CenterTrack architecture, which takes pairs of frames as input, and extend it to videos of arbitrary length. To this end, we augment the model with a spatio-temporal, recurrent memory module, allowing it to reason about object locations and identities in the current frame using all the previous history. It is, however, not obvious how to train such an approach. We study this question on a new, large-scale, synthetic dataset for multi-object tracking, which provides ground truth annotations for invisible objects, and propose several approaches for supervising tracking behind occlusions. Our model, trained jointly on synthetic and real data, outperforms the state of the art on KITTI and MOT17 datasets thanks to its robustness to occlusions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracking Transforming Objects: A Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18143v2)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking transforming objects holds significant importance in various fields due to the dynamic nature of many real-world scenarios. By enabling systems accurately represent transforming objects over time, tracking transforming objects facilitates advancements in areas such as autonomous systems, human-computer interaction, and security applications. Moreover, understanding the behavior of transforming objects provides valuable insights into complex interactions or processes, contributing to the development of intelligent systems capable of robust and adaptive perception in dynamic environments. However, current research in the field mainly focuses on tracking generic objects. In this study, we bridge this gap by collecting a novel dedicated Dataset for Tracking Transforming Objects, called DTTO, which contains 100 sequences, amounting to approximately 9.3K frames. We provide carefully hand-annotated bounding boxes for each frame within these sequences, making DTTO the pioneering benchmark dedicated to tracking transforming objects. We thoroughly evaluate 20 state-of-the-art trackers on the benchmark, aiming to comprehend the performance of existing methods and provide a comparison for future research on DTTO. With the release of DTTO, our goal is to facilitate further research and applications related to tracking transforming objects.</p></details> |  |

Visual object tracking also has many challenges, e.g., object occlusion and deformation. To solve above problems and track the target accurately and efficiently, many tracking algorithms have emerged in recent years. This paper presents the rationale and representative works of two most popular tracking frameworks in past ten years, i.e., the corelation filter and Siamese network for object tracking. Then we present some deep learning based tracking methods categorized by different network structures. We also introduce some classical strategies for handling the challenges in tracking problem. Further, this paper detailedly present and compare the benchmarks and challenges for tracking, from which we summarize the development history and development trend of visual tracking. Focusing on the future development of object tracking, which we think would be applied in real-world scenes before some problems to be addressed, such as the problems in long-term tracking, low-power high-speed tracking and attack-robust tracking. In the future, the integration of multimodal data, e.g., the depth image, thermal image with traditional color image, will provide more solutions for visual tracking. Moreover, tracking task will go together with some other tasks, e.g., video object detection and segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, in Chinese survey paper, Chinese Journal of Computers 2022</p></details> |
| **[Pixel-wise object tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07377v2)** | 2018-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel pixel-wise visual object tracking framework that can track any anonymous object in a noisy background. The framework consists of two submodels, a global attention model and a local segmentation model. The global model generates a region of interests (ROI) that the object may lie in the new frame based on the past object segmentation maps, while the local model segments the new image in the ROI. Each model uses a LSTM structure to model the temporal dynamics of the motion and appearance, respectively. To circumvent the dependency of the training data between the two models, we use an iterative update strategy. Once the models are trained, there is no need to refine them to track specific objects, making our method efficient compared to online learning approaches. We demonstrate our real time pixel-wise object tracking framework on a challenging VOT dataset</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracking Objects as Points](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.01177v2)** | 2020-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking has traditionally been the art of following interest points through space and time. This changed with the rise of powerful deep networks. Nowadays, tracking is dominated by pipelines that perform object detection followed by temporal association, also known as tracking-by-detection. In this paper, we present a simultaneous detection and tracking algorithm that is simpler, faster, and more accurate than the state of the art. Our tracker, CenterTrack, applies a detection model to a pair of images and detections from the prior frame. Given this minimal input, CenterTrack localizes objects and predicts their associations with the previous frame. That's it. CenterTrack is simple, online (no peeking into the future), and real-time. It achieves 67.3% MOTA on the MOT17 challenge at 22 FPS and 89.4% MOTA on the KITTI tracking benchmark at 15 FPS, setting a new state of the art on both datasets. CenterTrack is easily extended to monocular 3D tracking by regressing additional 3D attributes. Using monocular video input, it achieves 28.3% AMOTA@0.2 on the newly released nuScenes 3D tracking benchmark, substantially outperforming the monocular baseline on this benchmark while running at 28 FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECCV ...</summary><p>ECCV 2020 Camera-ready version.

| **[Learning to Track Any Object](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.11844v1)** | 2019-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object tracking can be formulated as "finding the right object in a video". We observe that recent approaches for class-agnostic tracking tend to focus on the "finding" part, but largely overlook the "object" part of the task, essentially doing a template matching over a frame in a sliding-window. In contrast, class-specific trackers heavily rely on object priors in the form of category-specific object detectors. In this work, we re-purpose category-specific appearance models into a generic objectness prior. Our approach converts a category-specific object detector into a category-agnostic, object-specific detector (i.e. a tracker) efficiently, on the fly. Moreover, at test time the same network can be applied to detection and tracking, resulting in a unified approach for the two tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two recent large-scale tracking benchmarks (OxUvA and GOT, using external data). By simply adding a mask prediction branch, our approach is able to produce instance segmentation masks for the tracked object. Despite only using box-level information on the first frame, our method outputs high-quality masks, as evaluated on the DAVIS '17 video object segmentation benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at the Holistic Video Understanding workshop at ICCV</p></details> |
| **[Tracking Reflected Objects: A Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05235v1)** | 2024-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual tracking has advanced significantly in recent years, mainly due to the availability of large-scale training datasets. These datasets have enabled the development of numerous algorithms that can track objects with high accuracy and robustness.However, the majority of current research has been directed towards tracking generic objects, with less emphasis on more specialized and challenging scenarios. One such challenging scenario involves tracking reflected objects. Reflections can significantly distort the appearance of objects, creating ambiguous visual cues that complicate the tracking process. This issue is particularly pertinent in applications such as autonomous driving, security, smart homes, and industrial production, where accurately tracking objects reflected in surfaces like mirrors or glass is crucial. To address this gap, we introduce TRO, a benchmark specifically for Tracking Reflected Objects. TRO includes 200 sequences with around 70,000 frames, each carefully annotated with bounding boxes. This dataset aims to encourage the development of new, accurate methods for tracking reflected objects, which present unique challenges not sufficiently covered by existing benchmarks. We evaluated 20 state-of-the-art trackers and found that they struggle with the complexities of reflections. To provide a stronger baseline, we propose a new tracker, HiP-HaTrack, which uses hierarchical features to improve performance, significantly outperforming existing algorithms. We believe our benchmark, evaluation, and HiP-HaTrack will inspire further research and applications in tracking reflected objects. The TRO and code are available at https://github.com/OpenCodeGithub/HIP-HaTrack.</p></details> |  |
| **[3D Object Tracking with Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.14921v1)** | 2021-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Feature fusion and similarity computation are two core problems in 3D object tracking, especially for object tracking using sparse and disordered point clouds. Feature fusion could make similarity computing more efficient by including target object information. However, most existing LiDAR-based approaches directly use the extracted point cloud feature to compute similarity while ignoring the attention changes of object regions during tracking. In this paper, we propose a feature fusion network based on transformer architecture. Benefiting from the self-attention mechanism, the transformer encoder captures the inter- and intra- relations among different regions of the point cloud. By using cross-attention, the transformer decoder fuses features and includes more target cues into the current point cloud feature to compute the region attentions, which makes the similarity computing more efficient. Based on this feature fusion network, we propose an end-to-end point cloud object tracking framework, a simple yet effective method for 3D object tracking using point clouds. Comprehensive experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance. Code is available at: https://github.com/3bobo/lttr.</p></details> | BMVC2021 |

Such coin-like objects often rotate fast with respect to an arbitrary axis producing unique challenges, such as fast incident light and aspect ratio change and rotational motion blur. Despite being common, neither tracking sequences containing coin-like objects nor suitable algorithm have been published. As a second contribution, we present a novel coin-tracking benchmark containing 17 video sequences annotated with object segmentation masks. Experiments show that the sequences differ significantly from the ones encountered in standard tracking datasets. We propose a baseline coin-tracking method based on convolutional neural network segmentation and explicit pose modeling. Its performance confirms that coin-tracking is an open and challenging problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to GCPR 2019.

| **[Multi-Object Tracking in the Dark](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06600v1)** | 2024-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-light scenes are prevalent in real-world applications (e.g. autonomous driving and surveillance at night). Recently, multi-object tracking in various practical use cases have received much attention, but multi-object tracking in dark scenes is rarely considered. In this paper, we focus on multi-object tracking in dark scenes. To address the lack of datasets, we first build a Low-light Multi-Object Tracking (LMOT) dataset. LMOT provides well-aligned low-light video pairs captured by our dual-camera system, and high-quality multi-object tracking annotations for all videos. Then, we propose a low-light multi-object tracking method, termed as LTrack. We introduce the adaptive low-pass downsample module to enhance low-frequency components of images outside the sensor noises. The degradation suppression learning strategy enables the model to learn invariant information under noise disturbance and image quality degradation. These components improve the robustness of multi-object tracking in dark scenes. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of our LMOT dataset and proposed LTrack. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method and its competitiveness in real night low-light scenes.

| **[On the detection-to-track association for online multi-object tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.00500v1)** | 2021-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Driven by recent advances in object detection with deep neural networks, the tracking-by-detection paradigm has gained increasing prevalence in the research community of multi-object tracking (MOT). It has long been known that appearance information plays an essential role in the detection-to-track association, which lies at the core of the tracking-by-detection paradigm. While most existing works consider the appearance distances between the detections and the tracks, they ignore the statistical information implied by the historical appearance distance records in the tracks, which can be particularly useful when a detection has similar distances with two or more tracks. In this work, we propose a hybrid track association (HTA) algorithm that models the historical appearance distances of a track with an incremental Gaussian mixture model (IGMM) and incorporates the derived statistical information into the calculation of the detection-to-track association cost. Experimental results on three MOT benchmarks confirm that HTA effectively improves the target identification performance with a small compromise to the tracking speed. Additionally, compared to many state-of-the-art trackers, the DeepSORT tracker equipped with HTA achieves better or comparable performance in terms of the balance of tracking quality and speed.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoMaL Tracking: Tracking Points at the Object Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02331v1)** | 2017-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional point tracking algorithms such as the KLT use local 2D information aggregation for feature detection and tracking, due to which their performance degrades at the object boundaries that separate multiple objects. Recently, CoMaL Features have been proposed that handle such a case. However, they proposed a simple tracking framework where the points are re-detected in each frame and matched. This is inefficient and may also lose many points that are not re-detected in the next frame. We propose a novel tracking algorithm to accurately and efficiently track CoMaL points. For this, the level line segment associated with the CoMaL points is matched to MSER segments in the next frame using shape-based matching and the matches are further filtered using texture-based matching. Experiments show improvements over a simple re-detect-and-match framework as well as KLT in terms of speed/accuracy on different real-world applications, especially at the object boundaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, to appear in 1st Joint BMTT-PETS Workshop on Tracking and Surveillance, CVPR 2017</p></details> |
| **[Multi-object Tracking with Tracked Object Bounding Box Association](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.07901v1)** | 2021-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The CenterTrack tracking algorithm achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance using a simple detection model and single-frame spatial offsets to localize objects and predict their associations in a single network. However, this joint detection and tracking method still suffers from high identity switches due to the inferior association method. To reduce the high number of identity switches and improve the tracking accuracy, in this paper, we propose to incorporate a simple tracked object bounding box and overlapping prediction based on the current frame onto the CenterTrack algorithm. Specifically, we propose an Intersection over Union (IOU) distance cost matrix in the association step instead of simple point displacement distance. We evaluate our proposed tracker on the MOT17 test dataset, showing that our proposed method can reduce identity switches significantly by 22.6% and obtain a notable improvement of 1.5% in IDF1 compared to the original CenterTrack's under the same tracklet lifetime.

| **[Tracking Holistic Object Representations](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12920v2)** | 2019-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in visual tracking are based on siamese feature extractors and template matching. For this category of trackers, latest research focuses on better feature embeddings and similarity measures. In this work, we focus on building holistic object representations for tracking. We propose a framework that is designed to be used on top of previous trackers without any need for further training of the siamese network. The framework leverages the idea of obtaining additional object templates during the tracking process. Since the number of stored templates is limited, our method only keeps the most diverse ones. We achieve this by providing a new diversity measure in the space of siamese features. The obtained representation contains information beyond the ground truth object location provided to the system. It is then useful for tracking itself but also for further tasks which require a visual understanding of objects. Strong empirical results on tracking benchmarks indicate that our method can improve the performance and robustness of the underlying trackers while barely reducing their speed. In addition, our method is able to match current state-of-the-art results, while using a simpler and older network architecture and running three times faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at BMVC 2019</p></details> |
| **[Unified Transformer Tracker for Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.15175v2)** | 2022-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an important area in computer vision, object tracking has formed two separate communities that respectively study Single Object Tracking (SOT) and Multiple Object Tracking (MOT). However, current methods in one tracking scenario are not easily adapted to the other due to the divergent training datasets and tracking objects of both tasks. Although UniTrack \cite{wang2021different} demonstrates that a shared appearance model with multiple heads can be used to tackle individual tracking tasks, it fails to exploit the large-scale tracking datasets for training and performs poorly on single object tracking. In this work, we present the Unified Transformer Tracker (UTT) to address tracking problems in different scenarios with one paradigm. A track transformer is developed in our UTT to track the target in both SOT and MOT. The correlation between the target and tracking frame features is exploited to localize the target. We demonstrate that both SOT and MOT tasks can be solved within this framework. The model can be simultaneously end-to-end trained by alternatively optimizing the SOT and MOT objectives on the datasets of individual tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on several benchmarks with a unified model trained on SOT and MOT datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/Flowerfan/Trackron.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 |
| **[MeMOT: Multi-Object Tracking with Memory](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.16761v1)** | 2022-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an online tracking algorithm that performs the object detection and data association under a common framework, capable of linking objects after a long time span. This is realized by preserving a large spatio-temporal memory to store the identity embeddings of the tracked objects, and by adaptively referencing and aggregating useful information from the memory as needed. Our model, called MeMOT, consists of three main modules that are all Transformer-based: 1) Hypothesis Generation that produce object proposals in the current video frame; 2) Memory Encoding that extracts the core information from the memory for each tracked object; and 3) Memory Decoding that solves the object detection and data association tasks simultaneously for multi-object tracking. When evaluated on widely adopted MOT benchmark datasets, MeMOT observes very competitive performance.</p></details> | CVPR 2022 Oral |
| **[Track, then Decide: Category-Agnostic Vision-based Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.07920v1)** | 2017-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The most common paradigm for vision-based multi-object tracking is tracking-by-detection, due to the availability of reliable detectors for several important object categories such as cars and pedestrians. However, future mobile systems will need a capability to cope with rich human-made environments, in which obtaining detectors for every possible object category would be infeasible. In this paper, we propose a model-free multi-object tracking approach that uses a category-agnostic image segmentation method to track objects. We present an efficient segmentation mask-based tracker which associates pixel-precise masks reported by the segmentation. Our approach can utilize semantic information whenever it is available for classifying objects at the track level, while retaining the capability to track generic unknown objects in the absence of such information. We demonstrate experimentally that our approach achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art tracking-by-detection methods for popular object categories such as cars and pedestrians. Additionally, we show that the proposed method can discover and robustly track a large variety of other objects.</p></details> | ICRA'18 submission |
| **[Measurement-wise Occlusion in Multi-object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1805.08324v1)** | 2018-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Handling object interaction is a fundamental challenge in practical multi-object tracking, even for simple interactive effects such as one object temporarily occluding another. We formalize the problem of occlusion in tracking with two different abstractions. In object-wise occlusion, objects that are occluded by other objects do not generate measurements. In measurement-wise occlusion, a previously unstudied approach, all objects may generate measurements but some measurements may be occluded by others. While the relative validity of each abstraction depends on the situation and sensor, measurement-wise occlusion fits into probabilistic multi-object tracking algorithms with much looser assumptions on object interaction. Its value is demonstrated by showing that it naturally derives a popular approximation for lidar tracking, and by an example of visual tracking in image space.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presenting at 21st International Conference on Information Fusion, 2018</p></details> |

Although leaderboards and ranking tables should not be over-claimed, benchmarks often provide the most objective measure of performance and are therefore important guides for reseach. Recently, a new benchmark for Multiple Object Tracking, MOTChallenge, was launched with the goal of collecting existing and new data and creating a framework for the standardized evaluation of multiple object tracking methods. The first release of the benchmark focuses on multiple people tracking, since pedestrians are by far the most studied object in the tracking community. This paper accompanies a new release of the MOTChallenge benchmark. Unlike the initial release, all videos of MOT16 have been carefully annotated following a consistent protocol. Moreover, it not only offers a significant increase in the number of labeled boxes, but also provides multiple object classes beside pedestrians and the level of visibility for every single object of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:1504.01942</p></details> |

While there are various excellent tracking benchmarks available, this work expands them to quantify the performance of long-term, non-contiguous, multi-object and detection model assisted trackers. We propose a suite of MONCE (Multi-Object Non-Contiguous Entities) image tracking metrics that provide both objective tracking model performance benchmarks as well as diagnostic insight for driving tracking model development in the form of Expected Average Overlap, Short/Long Term Re-Identification, Tracking Recall, Tracking Precision, Longevity, Localization and Absence Prediction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tracking Objects as Pixel-wise Distributions](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.05518v2)** | 2022-07-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) requires detecting and associating objects through frames. Unlike tracking via detected bounding boxes or tracking objects as points, we propose tracking objects as pixel-wise distributions. We instantiate this idea on a transformer-based architecture, P3AFormer, with pixel-wise propagation, prediction, and association. P3AFormer propagates pixel-wise features guided by flow information to pass messages between frames. Furthermore, P3AFormer adopts a meta-architecture to produce multi-scale object feature maps. During inference, a pixel-wise association procedure is proposed to recover object connections through frames based on the pixel-wise prediction. P3AFormer yields 81.2\% in terms of MOTA on the MOT17 benchmark -- the first among all transformer networks to reach 80\% MOTA in literature. P3AFormer also outperforms state-of-the-arts on the MOT20 and KITTI benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ECCV22 as an oral presentation paper.

| **[Faster object tracking pipeline for real time tracking](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.03910v1)** | 2020-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a challenging practical problem for vision based applications. Most recent approaches for MOT use precomputed detections from models such as Faster RCNN, performing fine-tuning of bounding boxes and association in subsequent phases. However, this is not suitable for actual industrial applications due to unavailability of detections upfront. In their recent work, Wang et al. proposed a tracking pipeline that uses a Joint detection and embedding model and performs target localization and association in realtime. Upon investigating the tracking by detection paradigm, we find that the tracking pipeline can be made faster by performing localization and association tasks parallely with model prediction. This, and other computational optimizations such as using mixed precision model and performing batchwise detection result in a speed-up of the tracking pipeline by 57.8\% (19 FPS to 30 FPS) on FullHD resolution. Moreover, the speed is independent of the object density in image sequence. The main contribution of this paper is showcasing a generic pipeline which can be used to speed up detection based object tracking methods. We also reviewed different batch sizes for optimal performance, taking into consideration GPU memory usage and speed.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

We propose a framework where LLaVA analyzes input images and generates textual descriptions, hereinafter LLaVA-generated prompts. These prompts, along with the original image, are fed into the image-to-image generation pipeline. This enriched representation guides the generation process towards outputs that exhibit a stronger resemblance to the input image. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LLaVA-generated prompts in promoting image similarity. We observe a significant improvement in the visual coherence between the generated and input images compared to traditional methods. Future work will explore fine-tuning LLaVA prompts for increased control over the creative process. By providing more specific details within the prompts, we aim to achieve a delicate balance between faithfulness to the original image and artistic expression in the generated outputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 5th International Conference on Information Science, Parallel and Distributed Systems</p></details> |

| **[The Challenges of Image Generation Models in Generating Multi-Component Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.13620v1)** | 2023-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image generators have led to substantial capabilities in image generation. However, the complexity of prompts acts as a bottleneck in the quality of images generated. A particular under-explored facet is the ability of generative models to create high-quality images comprising multiple components given as a prior. In this paper, we propose and validate a metric called Components Inclusion Score (CIS) to evaluate the extent to which a model can correctly generate multiple components. Our results reveal that the evaluated models struggle to incorporate all the visual elements from prompts with multiple components (8.53% drop in CIS per component for all evaluated models). We also identify a significant decline in the quality of the images and context awareness within an image as the number of components increased (15.91% decrease in inception Score and 9.62% increase in Frechet Inception Distance). To remedy this issue, we fine-tuned Stable Diffusion V2 on a custom-created test dataset with multiple components, outperforming its vanilla counterpart. To conclude, these findings reveal a critical limitation in existing text-to-image generators, shedding light on the challenge of generating multiple components within a single image using a complex prompt.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Generative Imaging and Image Processing via Generative Encoder](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13300v1)** | 2019-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel generative encoder (GE) model for generative imaging and image processing with applications in compressed sensing and imaging, image compression, denoising, inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution. The GE model consists of a pre-training phase and a solving phase. In the pre-training phase, we separately train two deep neural networks: a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a generator $\G$ that captures the data distribution of a given image set, and an auto-encoder (AE) network with an encoder $\EN$ that compresses images following the estimated distribution by GAN. In the solving phase, given a noisy image $x=\mathcal{P}(x^*)$, where $x^*$ is the target unknown image, $\mathcal{P}$ is an operator adding an addictive, or multiplicative, or convolutional noise, or equivalently given such an image $x$ in the compressed domain, i.e., given $m=\EN(x)$, we solve the optimization problem \[ z^*=\underset{z}{\mathrm{argmin}} \|\EN(\G(z))-m\|_2^2+λ\|z\|_2^2 \] to recover the image $x^*$ in a generative way via $\hat{x}:=\G(z^*)\approx x^*$, where $λ>0$ is a hyperparameter. The GE model unifies the generative capacity of GANs and the stability of AEs in an optimization framework above instead of stacking GANs and AEs into a single network or combining their loss functions into one as in existing literature. Numerical experiments show that the proposed model outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms.</p></details> |  |

By design, TTI models always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate default images: images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. Studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for prompt engineering and TTI generation. We present the first investigation into default images on Midjourney. We describe an initial study in which we manually created input prompts triggering default images, and several ablation studies. Building on these, we conduct a computational analysis of about 750,000 images, revealing consistent default images across unrelated prompts. We also conduct an online user study investigating how default images may affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI generation, highlighting their practical relevance as well as challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |

However, these methods require the training of one specific model for every pair of image domains, which limits the scalability in dealing with more than two image domains. In addition, the training stage of these methods has the common problem of model collapse that degrades the quality of the generated images. To tackle these issues, we propose a Dual Generator Generative Adversarial Network (G$^2$GAN), which is a robust and scalable approach allowing to perform unpaired image-to-image translation for multiple domains using only dual generators within a single model. Moreover, we explore different optimization losses for better training of G$^2$GAN, and thus make unpaired image-to-image translation with higher consistency and better stability. Extensive experiments on six publicly available datasets with different scenarios, i.e., architectural buildings, seasons, landscape and human faces, demonstrate that the proposed G$^2$GAN achieves superior model capacity and better generation performance comparing with existing image-to-image translation GAN models.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, accepted to ACCV 2018</p></details> |

Current research directions involve generating text based on an image or vice versa. In this paper, we propose a new task called CIGLI: Conditional Image Generation from Language and Image. Instead of generating an image based on text as in text-image generation, this task requires the generation of an image from a textual description and an image prompt. We designed a new dataset to ensure that the text description describes information from both images, and that solely analyzing the description is insufficient to generate an image. We then propose a novel language-image fusion model which improves the performance over two established baseline methods, as evaluated by quantitative (automatic) and qualitative (human) evaluations. The code and dataset is available at https://github.com/vincentlux/CIGLI.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[GlyphDiffusion: Text Generation as Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.12519v2)** | 2023-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become a new generative paradigm for text generation. Considering the discrete categorical nature of text, in this paper, we propose GlyphDiffusion, a novel diffusion approach for text generation via text-guided image generation. Our key idea is to render the target text as a glyph image containing visual language content. In this way, conditional text generation can be cast as a glyph image generation task, and it is then natural to apply continuous diffusion models to discrete texts. Specially, we utilize a cascaded architecture (ie a base and a super-resolution diffusion model) to generate high-fidelity glyph images, conditioned on the input text. Furthermore, we design a text grounding module to transform and refine the visual language content from generated glyph images into the final texts. In experiments over four conditional text generation tasks and two classes of metrics (ie quality and diversity), GlyphDiffusion can achieve comparable or even better results than several baselines, including pretrained language models. Our model also makes significant improvements compared to the recent diffusion model.</p></details> | working in progress |

Maps became an important part of life whose conversion from satellite images may be a bit expensive but Generative models can pander to this challenge. These models aims at finding the patterns between the input and output image. Image to image translation is employed to convert satellite image to corresponding map. Different techniques for image to image translations like Generative adversarial network, Conditional adversarial networks and Co-Variational Auto encoders are used to generate the corresponding human-readable maps for that region, which takes a satellite image at a given zoom level as its input. We are training our model on Conditional Generative Adversarial Network which comprises of Generator model which which generates fake images while the discriminator tries to classify the image as real or fake and both these models are trained synchronously in adversarial manner where both try to fool each other and result in enhancing model performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Images Generated by Diffusers](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.05275v3)** | 2023-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the task of detecting images generated by text-to-image diffusion models. To evaluate this, we consider images generated from captions in the MSCOCO and Wikimedia datasets using two state-of-the-art models: Stable Diffusion and GLIDE. Our experiments show that it is possible to detect the generated images using simple Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs), starting from features extracted by CLIP, or traditional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We also observe that models trained on images generated by Stable Diffusion can detect images generated by GLIDE relatively well, however, the reverse is not true. Lastly, we find that incorporating the associated textual information with the images rarely leads to significant improvement in detection results but that the type of subject depicted in the image can have a significant impact on performance. This work provides insights into the feasibility of detecting generated images, and has implications for security and privacy concerns in real-world applications. The code to reproduce our results is available at: https://github.com/davide-coccomini/Detecting-Images-Generated-by-Diffusers</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Generated Images by Real Images Only](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.00962v1)** | 2023-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As deep learning technology continues to evolve, the images yielded by generative models are becoming more and more realistic, triggering people to question the authenticity of images. Existing generated image detection methods detect visual artifacts in generated images or learn discriminative features from both real and generated images by massive training. This learning paradigm will result in efficiency and generalization issues, making detection methods always lag behind generation methods. This paper approaches the generated image detection problem from a new perspective: Start from real images. By finding the commonality of real images and mapping them to a dense subspace in feature space, the goal is that generated images, regardless of their generative model, are then projected outside the subspace. As a result, images from different generative models can be detected, solving some long-existing problems in the field. Experimental results show that although our method was trained only by real images and uses 99.9\% less training data than other deep learning-based methods, it can compete with state-of-the-art methods and shows excellent performance in detecting emerging generative models with high inference efficiency. Moreover, the proposed method shows robustness against various post-processing. These advantages allow the method to be used in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Iconicity of the Generated Image](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.16473v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How humans interpret and produce images is influenced by the images we have been exposed to. Similarly, visual generative AI models are exposed to many training images and learn to generate new images based on this. Given the importance of iconic images in human visual communication, as they are widely seen, reproduced, and used as inspiration, we may expect that they may similarly have a proportionally large influence within the generative AI process. In this work we explore this question through a three-part analysis, involving data attribution, semantic similarity analysis, and a user-study. Our findings indicate that iconic images do not have an obvious influence on the generative process, and that for many icons it is challenging to reproduce an image which resembles it closely. This highlights an important difference in how humans and visual generative AI models draw on and learn from prior visual communication.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work presented at EA-AI 2025, May 2025, Venice</p></details> |
| **[Active Generation for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06517v2)** | 2024-08-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the growing capabilities of deep generative models have underscored their potential in enhancing image classification accuracy. However, existing methods often demand the generation of a disproportionately large number of images compared to the original dataset, while having only marginal improvements in accuracy. This computationally expensive and time-consuming process hampers the practicality of such approaches. In this paper, we propose to address the efficiency of image generation by focusing on the specific needs and characteristics of the model. With a central tenet of active learning, our method, named ActGen, takes a training-aware approach to image generation. It aims to create images akin to the challenging or misclassified samples encountered by the current model and incorporates these generated images into the training set to augment model performance. ActGen introduces an attentive image guidance technique, using real images as guides during the denoising process of a diffusion model. The model's attention on class prompt is leveraged to ensure the preservation of similar foreground object while diversifying the background. Furthermore, we introduce a gradient-based generation guidance method, which employs two losses to generate more challenging samples and prevent the generated images from being too similar to previously generated ones. Experimental results on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our method achieves better performance with a significantly reduced number of generated images.

| **[PKU-I2IQA: An Image-to-Image Quality Assessment Database for AI Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15556v2)** | 2023-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As image generation technology advances, AI-based image generation has been applied in various fields and Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) has garnered widespread attention. However, the development of AI-based image generative models also brings new problems and challenges. A significant challenge is that AI-generated images (AIGI) may exhibit unique distortions compared to natural images, and not all generated images meet the requirements of the real world. Therefore, it is of great significance to evaluate AIGIs more comprehensively. Although previous work has established several human perception-based AIGC image quality assessment (AIGCIQA) databases for text-generated images, the AI image generation technology includes scenarios like text-to-image and image-to-image, and assessing only the images generated by text-to-image models is insufficient. To address this issue, we establish a human perception-based image-to-image AIGCIQA database, named PKU-I2IQA. We conduct a well-organized subjective experiment to collect quality labels for AIGIs and then conduct a comprehensive analysis of the PKU-I2IQA database. Furthermore, we have proposed two benchmark models: NR-AIGCIQA based on the no-reference image quality assessment method and FR-AIGCIQA based on the full-reference image quality assessment method. Finally, leveraging this database, we conduct benchmark experiments and compare the performance of the proposed benchmark models. The PKU-I2IQA database and benchmarks will be released to facilitate future research on \url{https://github.com/jiquan123/I2IQA}.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Generating Embroidery Patterns Using Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.02909v1)** | 2020-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many scenarios in computer vision, machine learning, and computer graphics, there is a requirement to learn the mapping from an image of one domain to an image of another domain, called Image-to-image translation. For example, style transfer, object transfiguration, visually altering the appearance of weather conditions in an image, changing the appearance of a day image into a night image or vice versa, photo enhancement, to name a few. In this paper, we propose two machine learning techniques to solve the embroidery image-to-image translation. Our goal is to generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered image, from a user-uploaded image. Our techniques are modifications of two existing techniques, neural style transfer, and cycle-consistent generative-adversarial network. Neural style transfer renders the semantic content of an image from one domain in the style of a different image in another domain, whereas a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network learns the mapping from an input image to output image without any paired training data, and also learn a loss function to train this mapping. Furthermore, the techniques we propose are independent of any embroidery attributes, such as elevation of the image, light-source, start, and endpoints of a stitch, type of stitch used, fabric type, etc. Given the user image, our techniques can generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered image. We train and test our propose techniques on an embroidery dataset which consist of simple 2D images. To do so, we prepare an unpaired embroidery dataset with more than 8000 user-uploaded images along with embroidered images. Empirical results show that these techniques successfully generate an approximate preview of an embroidered version of a user image, which can help users in decision making.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07083v2)** | 2019-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel controllable text-to-image generative adversarial network (ControlGAN), which can effectively synthesise high-quality images and also control parts of the image generation according to natural language descriptions. To achieve this, we introduce a word-level spatial and channel-wise attention-driven generator that can disentangle different visual attributes, and allow the model to focus on generating and manipulating subregions corresponding to the most relevant words. Also, a word-level discriminator is proposed to provide fine-grained supervisory feedback by correlating words with image regions, facilitating training an effective generator which is able to manipulate specific visual attributes without affecting the generation of other content. Furthermore, perceptual loss is adopted to reduce the randomness involved in the image generation, and to encourage the generator to manipulate specific attributes required in the modified text. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing state of the art, and is able to effectively manipulate synthetic images using natural language descriptions.

| **[Image Generation Based on Image Style Extraction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01347v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation based on text-to-image generation models is a task with practical application scenarios that fine-grained styles cannot be precisely described and controlled in natural language, while the guidance information of stylized reference images is difficult to be directly aligned with the textual conditions of traditional textual guidance generation. This study focuses on how to maximize the generative capability of the pretrained generative model, by obtaining fine-grained stylistic representations from a single given stylistic reference image, and injecting the stylistic representations into the generative body without changing the structural framework of the downstream generative model, so as to achieve fine-grained controlled stylized image generation. In this study, we propose a three-stage training style extraction-based image generation method, which uses a style encoder and a style projection layer to align the style representations with the textual representations to realize fine-grained textual cue-based style guide generation. In addition, this study constructs the Style30k-captions dataset, whose samples contain a triad of images, style labels, and text descriptions, to train the style encoder and style projection layer in this experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[DE-FAKE: Detection and Attribution of Fake Images Generated by Text-to-Image Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.06998v2)** | 2023-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation models that generate images based on prompt descriptions have attracted an increasing amount of attention during the past few months. Despite their encouraging performance, these models raise concerns about the misuse of their generated fake images. To tackle this problem, we pioneer a systematic study on the detection and attribution of fake images generated by text-to-image generation models. Concretely, we first build a machine learning classifier to detect the fake images generated by various text-to-image generation models. We then attribute these fake images to their source models, such that model owners can be held responsible for their models' misuse. We further investigate how prompts that generate fake images affect detection and attribution. We conduct extensive experiments on four popular text-to-image generation models, including DALL$\cdot$E 2, Stable Diffusion, GLIDE, and Latent Diffusion, and two benchmark prompt-image datasets. Empirical results show that (1) fake images generated by various models can be distinguished from real ones, as there exists a common artifact shared by fake images from different models; (2) fake images can be effectively attributed to their source models, as different models leave unique fingerprints in their generated images; (3) prompts with the ``person'' topic or a length between 25 and 75 enable models to generate fake images with higher authenticity. All findings contribute to the community's insight into the threats caused by text-to-image generation models. We appeal to the community's consideration of the counterpart solutions, like ours, against the rapidly-evolving fake image generation.</p></details> |  |

The adversarial network simultaneously generates realistic medical images and corresponding annotations, which proven to be useful in many cases such as image augmentation, image registration, medical image generation, image reconstruction, and image-to-image translation. These properties bring the attention of the researcher in the field of medical image analysis and we are witness of rapid adaption in many novel and traditional applications. This chapter provides state-of-the-art progress in GANs-based clinical application in medical image generation, and cross-modality synthesis. The various framework of GANs which gained popularity in the interpretation of medical images, such as Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN), Laplacian GAN (LAPGAN), pix2pix, CycleGAN, and unsupervised image-to-image translation model (UNIT), continue to improve their performance by incorporating additional hybrid architecture, has been discussed. Further, some of the recent applications of these frameworks for image reconstruction, and synthesis, and future research directions in the area have been covered.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking Counterfactual Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.20287v5)** | 2025-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has revolutionised visual content editing, empowering users to effortlessly modify images and videos. However, not all edits are equal. To perform realistic edits in domains such as natural image or medical imaging, modifications must respect causal relationships inherent to the data generation process. Such image editing falls into the counterfactual image generation regime. Evaluating counterfactual image generation is substantially complex: not only it lacks observable ground truths, but also requires adherence to causal constraints. Although several counterfactual image generation methods and evaluation metrics exist, a comprehensive comparison within a unified setting is lacking. We present a comparison framework to thoroughly benchmark counterfactual image generation methods. We integrate all models that have been used for the task at hand and expand them to novel datasets and causal graphs, demonstrating the superiority of Hierarchical VAEs across most datasets and metrics. Our framework is implemented in a user-friendly Python package that can be extended to incorporate additional SCMs, causal methods, generative models, and datasets for the community to build on.

| **[Unified Generative Adversarial Networks for Controllable Image-to-Image Translation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.06112v2)** | 2020-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a unified Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for controllable image-to-image translation, i.e., transferring an image from a source to a target domain guided by controllable structures. In addition to conditioning on a reference image, we show how the model can generate images conditioned on controllable structures, e.g., class labels, object keypoints, human skeletons, and scene semantic maps. The proposed model consists of a single generator and a discriminator taking a conditional image and the target controllable structure as input. In this way, the conditional image can provide appearance information and the controllable structure can provide the structure information for generating the target result. Moreover, our model learns the image-to-image mapping through three novel losses, i.e., color loss, controllable structure guided cycle-consistency loss, and controllable structure guided self-content preserving loss. Also, we present the Fréchet ResNet Distance (FRD) to evaluate the quality of the generated images. Experiments on two challenging image translation tasks, i.e., hand gesture-to-gesture translation and cross-view image translation, show that our model generates convincing results, and significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on both tasks. Meanwhile, the proposed framework is a unified solution, thus it can be applied to solving other controllable structure guided image translation tasks such as landmark guided facial expression translation and keypoint guided person image generation. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make one GAN framework work on all such controllable structure guided image translation tasks.

Medical images require specialized professionals for interpretation, and are explained (typically) via elaborate textual reports. Different from prior methods that focus on medical report generation from images or vice-versa, we novelly generate congruent image--report pairs employing a cyclic-Generative Adversarial Network (cycleGAN); thereby, the generated report will adequately explain a medical image, while a report-generated image that effectively characterizes the text visually should (sufficiently) resemble the original. The aim of the work is to generate trustworthy and faithful explanations for the outputs of a model diagnosing chest x-ray images by pointing a human user to similar cases in support of a diagnostic decision. Apart from enabling transparent medical image labeling and interpretation, we achieve report and image-based labeling comparable to prior methods, including state-of-the-art performance in some cases as evidenced by experiments on the Indiana Chest X-ray dataset</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2206.13123, arXiv:2111.07646</p></details> |
| **[Behavior Optimized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10995v1)** | 2023-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The last few years have witnessed great success on image generation, which has crossed the acceptance thresholds of aesthetics, making it directly applicable to personal and commercial applications. However, images, especially in marketing and advertising applications, are often created as a means to an end as opposed to just aesthetic concerns. The goal can be increasing sales, getting more clicks, likes, or image sales (in the case of stock businesses). Therefore, the generated images need to perform well on these key performance indicators (KPIs), in addition to being aesthetically good. In this paper, we make the first endeavor to answer the question of "How can one infuse the knowledge of the end-goal within the image generation process itself to create not just better-looking images but also "better-performing'' images?''. We propose BoigLLM, an LLM that understands both image content and user behavior. BoigLLM knows how an image should look to get a certain required KPI. We show that BoigLLM outperforms 13x larger models such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in this task, demonstrating that while these state-of-the-art models can understand images, they lack information on how these images perform in the real world. To generate actual pixels of behavior-conditioned images, we train a diffusion-based model (BoigSD) to align with a proposed BoigLLM-defined reward. We show the performance of the overall pipeline on two datasets covering two different behaviors: a stock dataset with the number of forward actions as the KPI and a dataset containing tweets with the total likes as the KPI, denoted as BoigBench. To advance research in the direction of utility-driven image generation and understanding, we release BoigBench, a benchmark dataset containing 168 million enterprise tweets with their media, brand account names, time of post, and total likes.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we seek to build a detector for telling apart real images from diffusion-generated images. We find that existing detectors struggle to detect images generated by diffusion models, even if we include generated images from a specific diffusion model in their training data. To address this issue, we propose a novel image representation called DIffusion Reconstruction Error (DIRE), which measures the error between an input image and its reconstruction counterpart by a pre-trained diffusion model. We observe that diffusion-generated images can be approximately reconstructed by a diffusion model while real images cannot. It provides a hint that DIRE can serve as a bridge to distinguish generated and real images. DIRE provides an effective way to detect images generated by most diffusion models, and it is general for detecting generated images from unseen diffusion models and robust to various perturbations. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive diffusion-generated benchmark including images generated by eight diffusion models to evaluate the performance of diffusion-generated image detectors. Extensive experiments on our collected benchmark demonstrate that DIRE exhibits superiority over previous generated-image detectors.

To this end, we start from a weak generator (text-to-image model) that creates diverse pairs between such two directions and gradually align it into a strong image editor that well balances between the two tasks. SeedEdit can achieve more diverse and stable editing capability over prior image editing methods, enabling sequential revision over images generated by diffusion models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our w...</summary><p>Our website: https://team.doubao.com/seededit</p></details> |

To tackle this challenge, we create an end-to-end solution that can generate artistic images from text descriptions. However, due to the lack of datasets with paired text description and artistic images, it is hard to directly train an algorithm which can create art based on text input. To address this issue, we split our task into three steps: (1) Generate a realistic image from a text description by using Dynamic Memory Generative Adversarial Network (arXiv:1904.01310), (2) Classify the image as a genre that exists in the WikiArt dataset using Resnet (arXiv: 1512.03385), (3) Select a style that is compatible with the genre and transfer it to the generated image by using neural artistic stylization network (arXiv:1705.06830).</p></details> | 7 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Event-Customized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.02483v1)** | 2024-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Customized Image Generation, generating customized images with user-specified concepts, has raised significant attention due to its creativity and novelty. With impressive progress achieved in subject customization, some pioneer works further explored the customization of action and interaction beyond entity (i.e., human, animal, and object) appearance. However, these approaches only focus on basic actions and interactions between two entities, and their effects are limited by insufficient ''exactly same'' reference images. To extend customized image generation to more complex scenes for general real-world applications, we propose a new task: event-customized image generation. Given a single reference image, we define the ''event'' as all specific actions, poses, relations, or interactions between different entities in the scene. This task aims at accurately capturing the complex event and generating customized images with various target entities. To solve this task, we proposed a novel training-free event customization method: FreeEvent. Specifically, FreeEvent introduces two extra paths alongside the general diffusion denoising process: 1) Entity switching path: it applies cross-attention guidance and regulation for target entity generation. 2) Event transferring path: it injects the spatial feature and self-attention maps from the reference image to the target image for event generation. To further facilitate this new task, we collected two evaluation benchmarks: SWiG-Event and Real-Event. Extensive experiments and ablations have demonstrated the effectiveness of FreeEvent.</p></details> |  |

By applying cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (CycleGANs) to a source domain of normal colonic mucosa images, we generate synthetic colorectal polyp images that belong to diagnostically less common polyp classes. Generated images maintain the general structure of their source image but exhibit adenomatous features that can be enhanced with our proposed filtration module, called Path-Rank-Filter. We evaluate the quality of generated images through Turing tests with four gastrointestinal pathologists, finding that at least two of the four pathologists could not identify generated images at a statistically significant level. Finally, we demonstrate that using CycleGAN-generated images to augment training data improves the AUC of a convolutional neural network for detecting sessile serrated adenomas by over 10%, suggesting that our approach might warrant further research for other histopathology image classification tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2019 Machine Learning for Health Workshop Full Paper (19/111 accepted papers = 17% acceptance rate)</p></details> |

The introduction of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and auto-encoders lead to the possibility of training on big data sets in an unsupervised manner. However, for many generative models it is not possible to specify what kind of image should be generated and it is not possible to translate existing images into new images of similar domains. Furthermore, models that can perform image-to-image translation often need distinct models for each domain, making it hard to scale these systems to multiple domain image-to-image translation. We introduce a model that can do both, controllable image generation and image-to-image translation between multiple domains. We split our image representation into two parts encoding unstructured and structured information respectively. The latter is designed in a disentangled manner, so that different parts encode different image characteristics. We train an encoder to encode images into these representations and use a small amount of labeled data to specify what kind of information should be encoded in the disentangled part. A generator is trained to generate images from these representations using the characteristics provided by the disentangled part of the representation. Through this we can control what kind of images the generator generates, translate images between different domains, and even learn unknown data-generating factors while only using one single model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks (IJCNN) 2018</p></details> |
