| **[DCCVT: Differentiable Clipped Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13603v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Marching Cubes (MC) and Marching Tetrahedra (MTet) are widely adopted in 3D reconstruction pipelines due to their simplicity and efficiency, their differentiable variants remain suboptimal for mesh extraction. This often limits the quality of 3D meshes reconstructed from point clouds or images in learning-based frameworks. In contrast, clipped CVTs offer stronger theoretical guarantees and yield higher-quality meshes. However, the lack of a differentiable formulation has prevented their integration into modern machine learning pipelines. To bridge this gap, we propose DCCVT, a differentiable algorithm that extracts high-quality 3D meshes from noisy signed distance fields (SDFs) using clipped CVTs. We derive a fully differentiable formulation for computing clipped CVTs and demonstrate its integration with deep learning-based SDF estimation to reconstruct accurate 3D meshes from input point clouds. Our experiments with synthetic data demonstrate the superior ability of DCCVT against state-of-the-art methods in mesh quality and reconstruction fidelity. https://wylliamcantincharawi.dev/DCCVT.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-Guided Adaptable Self-Supervised Learning for Human-Centric Visual Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13133v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human-centric visual analysis plays a pivotal role in diverse applications, including surveillance, healthcare, and human-computer interaction. With the emergence of large-scale unlabeled human image datasets, there is an increasing need for a general unsupervised pre-training model capable of supporting diverse human-centric downstream tasks. To achieve this goal, we propose CLASP (CLIP-guided Adaptable Self-suPervised learning), a novel framework designed for unsupervised pre-training in human-centric visual tasks. CLASP leverages the powerful vision-language model CLIP to generate both low-level (e.g., body parts) and high-level (e.g., attributes) semantic pseudo-labels. These multi-level semantic cues are then integrated into the learned visual representations, enriching their expressiveness and generalizability. Recognizing that different downstream tasks demand varying levels of semantic granularity, CLASP incorporates a Prompt-Controlled Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) module. MoE dynamically adapts feature extraction based on task-specific prompts, mitigating potential feature conflicts and enhancing transferability. Furthermore, CLASP employs a multi-task pre-training strategy, where part- and attribute-level pseudo-labels derived from CLIP guide the representation learning process. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that CLASP consistently outperforms existing unsupervised pre-training methods, advancing the field of human-centric visual analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TMM (IEEE Transactions on Multimedia), 16 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[High-Capacity and Low-PAPR BICM-OFDM Systems Using Non-Equiprobable and Non-Uniform Constellation Shaping With Clipping and Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15639v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter adjusts the number of signal points for further improving the total bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Unlike other exhaustive search-based approaches, the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only two parameters associated with NUC and cardinality. Due to this property of limited degrees of freedom, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</p></details> | 16 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Left-Right Symmetry Breaking in CLIP-style Vision-Language Models Trained on Synthetic Spatial-Relation Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12809v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial understanding remains a key challenge in vision-language models. Yet it is still unclear whether such understanding is truly acquired, and if so, through what mechanisms. We present a controllable 1D image-text testbed to probe how left-right relational understanding emerges in Transformer-based vision and text encoders trained with a CLIP-style contrastive objective. We train lightweight Transformer-based vision and text encoders end-to-end on paired descriptions of one- and two-object scenes and evaluate generalization to unseen object pairs while systematically varying label and layout diversity. We find that contrastive training learns left-right relations and that label diversity, more than layout diversity, is the primary driver of generalization in this setting. To gain the mechanistic understanding, we perform an attention decomposition and show that interactions between positional and token embeddings induce a horizontal attention gradient that breaks left-right symmetry in the encoders; ablating this contribution substantially reduces left-right discrimination. Our results provide a mechanistic insight of when and how CLIP-style models acquire relational competence.</p></details> |  |
| **[GazeFormer-MoE: Context-Aware Gaze Estimation via CLIP and MoE Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12316v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a semantics modulated, multi scale Transformer for 3D gaze estimation. Our model conditions CLIP global features with learnable prototype banks (illumination, head pose, background, direction), fuses these prototype-enriched global vectors with CLIP patch tokens and high-resolution CNN tokens in a unified attention space, and replaces several FFN blocks with routed/shared Mixture of Experts to increase conditional capacity. Evaluated on MPIIFaceGaze, EYEDIAP, Gaze360 and ETH-XGaze, our model achieves new state of the art angular errors of 2.49°, 3.22°, 10.16°, and 1.44°, demonstrating up to a 64% relative improvement over previously reported results. ablations attribute gains to prototype conditioning, cross scale fusion, MoE and hyperparameter.

| **[Offline Policy Learning with Weight Clipping and Heaviside Composite Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12117v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline policy learning aims to use historical data to learn an optimal personalized decision rule. In the standard estimate-then-optimize framework, reweighting-based methods (e.g., inverse propensity weighting or doubly robust estimators) are widely used to produce unbiased estimates of policy values. However, when the propensity scores of some treatments are small, these reweighting-based methods suffer from high variance in policy value estimation, which may mislead the downstream policy optimization and yield a learned policy with inferior value. In this paper, we systematically develop an offline policy learning algorithm based on a weight-clipping estimator that truncates small propensity scores via a clipping threshold chosen to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) in policy value estimation. Focusing on linear policies, we address the bilevel and discontinuous objective induced by weight-clipping-based policy optimization by reformulating the problem as a Heaviside composite optimization problem, which provides a rigorous computational framework. The reformulated policy optimization problem is then solved efficiently using the progressive integer programming method, making practical policy learning tractable. We establish an upper bound for the suboptimality of the proposed algorithm, which reveals how the reduction in MSE of policy value estimation, enabled by our proposed weight-clipping estimator, leads to improved policy learning performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[AGGC: Adaptive Group Gradient Clipping for Stabilizing Large Language Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11864v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To stabilize the training of Large Language Models (LLMs), gradient clipping is a nearly ubiquitous heuristic used to alleviate exploding gradients. However, traditional global norm clipping erroneously presupposes gradient homogeneity across different functional modules, leading to an adverse "spill-over" effect where volatile parameters force unnecessary scaling on stable ones. To overcome this, we propose Adaptive Group-wise Gradient Clipping (AGGC). AGGC partitions parameters into groups based on functional types and regulates each according to its historical behavior using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA). Specifically, it constructs an adaptive interval to simultaneously mitigate gradient explosion and vanishing, while employing a time-dependent scheduling mechanism to balance exploration and convergence. Experiments on LLaMA 2-7B, Mistral-7B, and Gemma-7B models show that AGGC consistently outperforms LoRA and frequently surpasses Full Fine-Tuning. On the GSM8K benchmark, Mistral-7B fine-tuned with AGGC achieves an accuracy of 72.93%, exceeding LoRA's 69.5%. AGGC also effectively stabilizes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), enhancing the logic deduction of Qwen 2.5 and Llama 3.2 models. Experimental results demonstrate that AGGC effectively addresses the limitations of traditional gradient clipping methods, particularly in overcoming gradient heterogeneity, by utilizing a modular, adaptive clipping strategy to stabilize the training process. Due to its lightweight design, AGGC can be seamlessly integrated into existing post-training pipelines with negligible overhead.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Think-Clip-Sample: Slow-Fast Frame Selection for Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11359v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has significantly advanced video understanding. However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[Breaking the Limits of Open-Weight CLIP: An Optimization Framework for Self-supervised Fine-tuning of CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09859v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP has become a cornerstone of multimodal representation learning, yet improving its performance typically requires a prohibitively costly process of training from scratch on billions of samples. We ask a different question: Can we improve the performance of open-weight CLIP models across various downstream tasks using only existing self-supervised datasets? Unlike supervised fine-tuning, which adapts a pretrained model to a single downstream task, our setting seeks to improve general performance across various tasks. However, as both our experiments and prior studies reveal, simply applying standard training protocols starting from an open-weight CLIP model often fails, leading to performance degradation. In this paper, we introduce TuneCLIP, a self-supervised fine-tuning framework that overcomes the performance degradation. TuneCLIP has two key components: (1) a warm-up stage of recovering optimization statistics to reduce cold-start bias, inspired by theoretical analysis, and (2) a fine-tuning stage of optimizing a new contrastive loss to mitigate the penalization on false negative pairs. Our extensive experiments show that TuneCLIP consistently improves performance across model architectures and scales. Notably, it elevates leading open-weight models like SigLIP (ViT-B/16), achieving gains of up to +2.5% on ImageNet and related out-of-distribution benchmarks, and +1.2% on the highly competitive DataComp benchmark, setting a new strong baseline for efficient post-pretraining adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[LiteEmbed: Adapting CLIP to Rare Classes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09661v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot recognition but struggle with classes that are rarely seen during pretraining, including newly emerging entities and culturally specific categories. We introduce LiteEmbed, a lightweight framework for few-shot personalization of CLIP that enables new classes to be added without retraining its encoders. LiteEmbed performs subspace-guided optimization of text embeddings within CLIP's vocabulary, leveraging a PCA-based decomposition that disentangles coarse semantic directions from fine-grained variations. Two complementary objectives, coarse alignment and fine separation, jointly preserve global semantic consistency while enhancing discriminability among visually similar classes. Once optimized, the embeddings are plug-and-play, seamlessly substituting CLIP's original text features across classification, retrieval, segmentation, and detection tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial gains over prior methods, establishing LiteEmbed as an effective approach for adapting CLIP to underrepresented, rare, or unseen classes.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Prototypical Contrastive Learning-based CLIP Fine-tuning for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17218v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to adapt large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, such as contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP), to enhance the performance of object reidentification (Re-ID) across various supervision settings. Although prompt learning has enabled a recent work named CLIP-ReID to achieve promising performance, the underlying mechanisms and the necessity of prompt learning remain unclear due to the absence of semantic labels in ReID tasks. In this work, we first analyze the role prompt learning in CLIP-ReID and identify its limitations. Based on our investigations, we propose a simple yet effective approach to adapt CLIP for supervised object Re-ID. Our approach directly fine-tunes the image encoder of CLIP using a prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) loss, eliminating the need for prompt learning. Experimental results on both person and vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to CLIP-ReID. Furthermore, we extend our PCL-based CLIP fine-tuning approach to unsupervised scenarios, where we achieve state-of-the art performance. Code is available at https://github.com/RikoLi/PCL-CLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Brain Signal Generation for Visual Prosthesis with CLIP Guided Multimodal Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present a novel image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging the diffusion transformer architecture enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) to achieve brain signal generation. To realize the goal of image-to-brain signal conversion, we use cross-attention mechanisms to align brain signal embeddings with CLIP image embeddings. Moreover, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate image captions, and concatenate the resulting CLIP text embeddings with CLIP image embeddings to form unified embeddings for cross-attention alignment, enabling our model to capture core semantic information. Moreover, to capture core semantic information, we use large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptive and semantically accurate captions for images. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable spatio-temporal position encoding that combines brain region embeddings with temporal embeddings to capture both spatial and temporal characteristics of brain signals. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[S3-CLIP: Video Super Resolution for Person-ReID](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08807v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracklet quality is often treated as an afterthought in most person re-identification (ReID) methods, with the majority of research presenting architectural modifications to foundational models. Such approaches neglect an important limitation, posing challenges when deploying ReID systems in real-world, difficult scenarios. In this paper, we introduce S3-CLIP, a video super-resolution-based CLIP-ReID framework developed for the VReID-XFD challenge at WACV 2026. The proposed method integrates recent advances in super-resolution networks with task-driven super-resolution pipelines, adapting them to the video-based person re-identification setting. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic investigation of video super-resolution as a means of enhancing tracklet quality for person ReID, particularly under challenging cross-view conditions. Experimental results demonstrate performance competitive with the baseline, achieving 37.52% mAP in aerial-to-ground and 29.16% mAP in ground-to-aerial scenarios. In the ground-to-aerial setting, S3-CLIP achieves substantial gains in ranking accuracy, improving Rank-1, Rank-5, and Rank-10 performance by 11.24%, 13.48%, and 17.98%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2026 IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision Workshops (WACVW), VReID-XFD Challenge</p></details> |
| **[MMLGNet: Cross-Modal Alignment of Remote Sensing Data using CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08420v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel multimodal framework, Multimodal Language-Guided Network (MMLGNet), to align heterogeneous remote sensing modalities like Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) and LiDAR with natural language semantics using vision-language models such as CLIP. With the increasing availability of multimodal Earth observation data, there is a growing need for methods that effectively fuse spectral, spatial, and geometric information while enabling semantic-level understanding. MMLGNet employs modality-specific encoders and aligns visual features with handcrafted textual embeddings in a shared latent space via bi-directional contrastive learning. Inspired by CLIP's training paradigm, our approach bridges the gap between high-dimensional remote sensing data and language-guided interpretation. Notably, MMLGNet achieves strong performance with simple CNN-based encoders, outperforming several established multimodal visual-only methods on two benchmark datasets, demonstrating the significant benefit of language supervision. Codes are available at https://github.com/AdityaChaudhary2913/CLIP_HSI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at InGARSS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Clipped Affine Policy: Low-Complexity Near-Optimal Online Power Control for Energy Harvesting Communications over Fading Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07622v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates online power control for point-to-point energy harvesting communications over wireless fading channels. A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, v0.8</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-GS: Unifying Vision-Language Representation with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19142v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in 3D multimodal learning have made remarkable progress. However, typically 3D multimodal models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAPL: Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning in CLIP for Weakly Supervised Image Manipulation Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06222v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious image manipulation threatens public safety and requires efficient localization methods. Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Understanding to Engagement: Personalized pharmacy Video Clips via Vision Language Models (VLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05059v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) are poised to revolutionize the digital transformation of pharmacyceutical industry by enabling intelligent, scalable, and automated multi-modality content processing. Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars). Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contributed original research to top tier conference in VLM; currently undergoing peer review</p></details> |
| **[Minimal Clips, Maximum Salience: Long Video Summarization via Key Moment Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11399v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are able to process increasingly longer videos. Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO: Ensuring Bounded Ratios for Stable and Generalizable Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03895v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARM: A Learnable, Plug-and-Play Module for CLIP-based Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24224v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Clipped Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: A Refined Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23178v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\frak p}$-th moment where ${\frak p}\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\frak l}^{\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\frak l}\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\in\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}d_{\rm eff}^{-1/2{\frak p}}\ln^{1-1/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ and ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2d_{\rm eff}^{-1/{\frak p}}\ln^{2-2/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\rm eff}\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part of this work is in submission</p></details> |

We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually. In this paper, to support robust training and evaluation, we construct a high-quality colonoscopy dataset comprising 2,240 images from 517 subjects, annotated with expert-agreed BBPS scores. We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, BMVC 2025 submission</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Cosine Similarity Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPECIAL: Zero-shot Hyperspectral Image Classification With CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16222v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to categorize each pixel in an HSI into a specific land cover class, which is crucial for applications such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and agriculture. Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations. The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning. In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands. These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores. To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales. In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/LiPang/SPECIAL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond CLIP: Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Transformers for Cross-Modal Alignment in Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19663v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</p></details> | 35 pages |

This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |

However, existing RL training pipelines are computationally inefficient and resource-intensive, with the rollout phase accounting for over 70% of total training time. Quantized RL training, particularly using FP8 precision, offers a promising approach to mitigating this bottleneck. A commonly adopted strategy applies FP8 precision during rollout while retaining BF16 precision for training. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study of FP8 RL training and demonstrate that the widely used BF16-training + FP8-rollout strategy suffers from severe training instability and catastrophic accuracy collapse under long-horizon rollouts and challenging tasks. Our analysis shows that these failures stem from the off-policy nature of the approach, which introduces substantial numerical mismatch between training and inference. Motivated by these observations, we propose Jet-RL, an FP8 RL training framework that enables robust and stable RL optimization. The key idea is to adopt a unified FP8 precision flow for both training and rollout, thereby minimizing numerical discrepancies and eliminating the need for inefficient inter-step calibration. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Jet-RL: our method achieves up to 33% speedup in the rollout phase, up to 41% speedup in the training phase, and a 16% end-to-end speedup over BF16 training, while maintaining stable convergence across all settings and incurring negligible accuracy degradation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

We introduce \textit{FireCastRL}, a proactive artificial intelligence (AI) framework that combines wildfire forecasting with intelligent suppression strategies. Our framework first uses a deep spatiotemporal model to predict wildfire ignition. For high-risk predictions, we deploy a pre-trained reinforcement learning (RL) agent to execute real-time suppression tactics with helitack units inside a physics-informed 3D simulation. The framework generates a threat assessment report to help emergency responders optimize resource allocation and planning. In addition, we are publicly releasing a large-scale, spatiotemporal dataset containing $\mathbf{9.5}$ million samples of environmental variables for wildfire prediction. Our work demonstrates how deep learning and RL can be combined to support both forecasting and tactical wildfire response.

| **[Q-learning with Adjoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14234v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[KAGE-Bench: Fast Known-Axis Visual Generalization Evaluation for Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14232v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel-based reinforcement learning agents often fail under purely visual distribution shift even when latent dynamics and rewards are unchanged, but existing benchmarks entangle multiple sources of shift and hinder systematic analysis. We introduce KAGE-Env, a JAX-native 2D platformer that factorizes the observation process into independently controllable visual axes while keeping the underlying control problem fixed. By construction, varying a visual axis affects performance only through the induced state-conditional action distribution of a pixel policy, providing a clean abstraction for visual generalization. Building on this environment, we define KAGE-Bench, a benchmark of six known-axis suites comprising 34 train-evaluation configuration pairs that isolate individual visual shifts. Using a standard PPO-CNN baseline, we observe strong axis-dependent failures, with background and photometric shifts often collapsing success, while agent-appearance shifts are comparatively benign. Several shifts preserve forward motion while breaking task completion, showing that return alone can obscure generalization failures. Finally, the fully vectorized JAX implementation enables up to 33M environment steps per second on a single GPU, enabling fast and reproducible sweeps over visual factors.

While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

However, standard RL assigns credit only at the level of the final answer, penalizing entire reasoning traces when the outcome is incorrect and uniformly reinforcing all steps when it is correct. As a result, correct intermediate steps may be discouraged in failed traces, while spurious steps may be reinforced in successful ones. We refer to this failure mode as the problem of credit assignment. While a natural remedy is to train a process reward model, accurately optimizing such models to identify corrective reasoning steps remains challenging. We introduce Intervention Training (InT), a training paradigm in which the model performs fine-grained credit assignment on its own reasoning traces by proposing short, targeted corrections that steer trajectories toward higher reward. Using reference solutions commonly available in mathematical reasoning datasets and exploiting the fact that verifying a model-generated solution is easier than generating a correct one from scratch, the model identifies the first error in its reasoning and proposes a single-step intervention to redirect the trajectory toward the correct solution. We then apply supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to the on-policy rollout up to the point of error concatenated with the intervention, localizing error to the specific step that caused failure. We show that the resulting model serves as a far better initialization for RL training. After running InT and subsequent fine-tuning with RL, we improve accuracy by nearly 14% over a 4B-parameter base model on IMO-AnswerBench, outperforming larger open-source models such as gpt-oss-20b.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiated Pickup Point Offering for Emission Reduction in Last-Mile Delivery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14196v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pickup points are widely recognized as a sustainable alternative to home delivery, as consolidating orders at pickup locations can shorten delivery routes and improve first-attempt success rates. However, these benefits may be negated when customers drive to pick up their orders. This study proposes a Differentiated Pickup Point Offering (DPO) policy that aims to jointly reduce emissions from delivery truck routes and customer travel. Under DPO, each arriving customer is offered a single recommended pickup point, rather than an unrestricted choice among all locations, while retaining the option of home delivery. We study this problem in a dynamic and stochastic setting, where the pickup point offered to each customer depends on previously realized customer locations and delivery choices. To design effective DPO policies, we adopt a reinforcement learning-based approach that accounts for spatial relationships between customers and pickup points and their implications for future route consolidation. Computational experiments show that differentiated pickup point offerings can substantially reduce total carbon emissions. The proposed policies reduce total emissions by up to 9% relative to home-only delivery and by 2% on average compared with alternative policies, including unrestricted pickup point choice and nearest pickup point assignment. Differentiated offerings are particularly effective in dense urban settings with many pickup points and short inter-location distances. Moreover, explicitly accounting for the dynamic nature of customer arrivals and choices is especially important when customers are less inclined to choose pickup point delivery over home delivery.</p></details> |  |

While the effectiveness of agents has continued to improve, efficiency, which is crucial for real-world deployment, has often been overlooked. This paper therefore investigates efficiency from three core components of agents: memory, tool learning, and planning, considering costs such as latency, tokens, steps, etc. Aimed at conducting comprehensive research addressing the efficiency of the agentic system itself, we review a broad range of recent approaches that differ in implementation yet frequently converge on shared high-level principles including but not limited to bounding context via compression and management, designing reinforcement learning rewards to minimize tool invocation, and employing controlled search mechanisms to enhance efficiency, which we discuss in detail. Accordingly, we characterize efficiency in two complementary ways: comparing effectiveness under a fixed cost budget, and comparing cost at a comparable level of effectiveness. This trade-off can also be viewed through the Pareto frontier between effectiveness and cost. From this perspective, we also examine efficiency oriented benchmarks by summarizing evaluation protocols for these components and consolidating commonly reported efficiency metrics from both benchmark and methodological studies. Moreover, we discuss the key challenges and future directions, with the goal of providing promising insights.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 200 references</p></details> |

Modern embodied AI systems often combine a Large Language Model (LLM)-based planner for high-level task planning and a reinforcement learning (RL)-based controller for low-level action generation, enabling embodied agents to tackle complex tasks in real-world environments. However, deploying embodied agents remains challenging due to their high computation requirements, especially for battery-powered local devices. Although techniques like lowering operating voltage can improve energy efficiency, they can introduce bit errors and result in task failures. In this work, we propose CREATE, a general design principle that leverages heterogeneous resilience at different layers for synergistic energy-reliability co-optimization. For the first time, we conduct a comprehensive error injection study on modern embodied AI systems and observe an inherent but heterogeneous fault tolerance. Building upon these insights, we develop an anomaly detection and clearance mechanism at the circuit level to eliminate outlier errors. At the model level, we propose a weight-rotation-enhanced planning algorithm to improve the fault tolerance of the LLM-based planner. Furthermore, we introduce an application-level technique, autonomy-adaptive voltage scaling, to dynamically adjust the operating voltage of the controllers. The voltage scaling circuit is co-designed to enable online voltage adjustment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that without compromising task quality, CREATE achieves 40.6% computational energy savings on average over nominal-voltage baselines and 35.0% over prior-art techniques. This further leads to 29.5% to 37.3% chip-level energy savings and approximately a 15% to 30% improvement in battery life.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 21 figures.

Most existing attacks are validated only in simulation, while their effectiveness in real-world robotic systems remains unclear. In physical deployment, safety-constrained control pipelines such as velocity limiting, action smoothing, and collision avoidance suppress abnormal actions, causing strong attenuation of conventional backdoor attacks. We study this previously overlooked problem and propose a diffusion-guided backdoor attack framework (DGBA) for real-world RL. We design small printable visual patch triggers placed on the floor and generate them using a conditional diffusion model that produces diverse patch appearances under real-world visual variations. We treat the robot control stack as a black-box system. We further introduce an advantage-based poisoning strategy that injects triggers only at decision-critical training states. We evaluate our method on a TurtleBot3 mobile robot and demonstrate reliable activation of targeted attacks while preserving normal task performance. Demo videos and code are available in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |

In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based approaches have gained significant attention for addressing UAV path planning tasks in large and complex environments, bridging the gap with real-world deployments. However, many existing algorithms suffer from limited training data, which hampers their performance in highly dynamic environments. Moreover, they often overlook the inherently multi-objective nature of the task, treating it in an overly simplistic manner. To address these limitations, we propose an attention-based Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) architecture that explicitly handles the trade-off between data collection and energy consumption in urban environments, even without prior knowledge of wireless channel conditions. Our method develops a single model capable of adapting to varying trade-off preferences and dynamic scenario parameters without the need for fine-tuning or retraining. Extensive simulations show that our approach achieves substantial improvements in performance, model compactness, sample efficiency, and most importantly, generalization to previously unseen scenarios, outperforming existing RL solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RM-Distiller: Exploiting Generative LLM for Reward Model Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14032v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models (RMs) play a pivotal role in aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. Due to the difficulty of obtaining high-quality human preference annotations, distilling preferences from generative LLMs has emerged as a standard practice. However, existing approaches predominantly treat teacher models as simple binary annotators, failing to fully exploit the rich knowledge and capabilities for RM distillation. To address this, we propose RM-Distiller, a framework designed to systematically exploit the multifaceted capabilities of teacher LLMs: (1) Refinement capability, which synthesizes highly correlated response pairs to create fine-grained and contrastive signals. (2) Scoring capability, which guides the RM in capturing precise preference strength via a margin-aware optimization objective. (3) Generation capability, which incorporates the teacher's generative distribution to regularize the RM to preserve its fundamental linguistic knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RM-Distiller significantly outperforms traditional distillation methods both on RM benchmarks and reinforcement learning-based alignment, proving that exploiting multifaceted teacher capabilities is critical for effective reward modeling. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic research on RM distillation from generative LLMs.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-empowered multi-level jamming approach to enhance the security of SemCom systems over MIMO fading wiretap channels. This approach combines semantic layer jamming, achieved by encoding task-irrelevant text, and physical layer jamming, achieved by encoding random Gaussian noise. These two-level jamming signals are superposed with task-relevant semantic information to protect the transmitted semantics from eavesdropping. A deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm is further introduced to dynamically design and optimize the precoding matrices for both task-relevant semantic information and multi-level jamming signals, aiming to enhance the legitimate user's image reconstruction while degrading the eavesdropper's performance. To jointly train the SemCom model and the DDPG agent, we propose an alternating optimization strategy where the two modules are updated iteratively. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with both the encryption-based (ESCS) and encoded jammer-based (EJ) benchmarks, our method achieves comparable security while improving the legitimate user's peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by up to approximately 0.6 dB.</p></details> |  |
| **[RL-BioAug: Label-Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Self-Supervised EEG Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13964v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quality of data augmentation serves as a critical determinant for the performance of contrastive learning in EEG tasks. Although this paradigm is promising for utilizing unlabeled data, static or random augmentation strategies often fail to preserve intrinsic information due to the non-stationarity of EEG signals where statistical properties change over time. To address this, we propose RL-BioAug, a framework that leverages a label-efficient reinforcement learning (RL) agent to autonomously determine optimal augmentation policies. While utilizing only a minimal fraction (10\%) of labeled data to guide the agent's policy, our method enables the encoder to learn robust representations in a strictly self-supervised manner. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-BioAug significantly outperforms the random selection strategy, achieving substantial improvements of 9.69\% and 8.80\% in Macro-F1 score on the Sleep-EDFX and CHB-MIT datasets, respectively. Notably, this agent mainly chose optimal strategies for each task -- for example, Time Masking with a 62\% probability for sleep stage classification and Crop \& Resize with a 77\% probability for seizure detection. Our framework suggests its potential to replace conventional heuristic-based augmentations and establish a new autonomous paradigm for data augmentation.

Recent search-augmented approaches attempt to address this limitation, but existing methods rely on indiscriminate whole-image retrieval that introduces substantial visual redundancy and noise, and lack deep iterative reflection, limiting their effectiveness on complex visual queries. To overcome these challenges, we propose Glance-or-Gaze (GoG), a fully autonomous framework that shifts from passive perception to active visual planning. GoG introduces a Selective Gaze mechanism that dynamically chooses whether to glance at global context or gaze into high-value regions, filtering irrelevant information before retrieval. We design a dual-stage training strategy: Reflective GoG Behavior Alignment via supervised fine-tuning instills the fundamental GoG paradigm, while Complexity-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning further enhances the model's capability to handle complex queries through iterative reasoning. Experiments across six benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Ablation studies confirm that both Selective Gaze and complexity-adaptive RL are essential for effective visual search. We will release our data and models for further exploration soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Switchable Safety Control in LLMs via Magic-Token-Guided Co-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14904v3)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current methods for content safety in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), often rely on multi-stage training pipelines and lack fine-grained, post-deployment controllability. To address these limitations, we propose a unified co-training framework that efficiently integrates multiple safety behaviors: positive (lawful/prosocial), negative (unfiltered/risk-prone) and rejective (refusal-oriented/conservative) within a single SFT stage. Notably, each behavior is dynamically activated via a simple system-level instruction, or magic token, enabling stealthy and efficient behavioral switching at inference time. This flexibility supports diverse deployment scenarios, such as positive for safe user interaction, negative for internal red-teaming, and rejective for context-aware refusals triggered by upstream moderation signals. This co-training strategy induces a distinct Safety Alignment Margin in the output space, characterized by well-separated response distributions corresponding to each safety mode. The existence of this margin provides empirical evidence for the model's safety robustness and enables unprecedented fine-grained control. Experiments show that our method matches the safety alignment quality of SFT+DPO, with our 8B model notably surpassing DeepSeek-R1 (671B) in safety performance, while significantly reducing both training complexity and deployment costs. This work presents a scalable, efficient, and highly controllable solution for LLM content safety.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages,3 figures,5 tables</p></details> |

Although recent methods have advanced medical report generation (MRG) and visual question answering (VQA) with medical vision-language models (VLMs), these methods, however, predominantly operate under a sample-isolated inference paradigm, as such processing cases independently without access to longitudinal electronic health records (EHRs) or structurally related patient examples. This paradigm limits reasoning to image-derived information alone, which ignores external complementary medical evidence for potentially more accurate diagnosis. To overcome this limitation, we propose \textbf{HyperWalker}, a \textit{Deep Diagnosis} framework that reformulates clinical reasoning via dynamic hypergraphs and test-time training. First, we construct a dynamic hypergraph, termed \textbf{iBrochure}, to model the structural heterogeneity of EHR data and implicit high-order associations among multimodal clinical information. Within this hypergraph, a reinforcement learning agent, \textbf{Walker}, navigates to and identifies optimal diagnostic paths. To ensure comprehensive coverage of diverse clinical characteristics in test samples, we incorporate a \textit{linger mechanism}, a multi-hop orthogonal retrieval strategy that iteratively selects clinically complementary neighborhood cases reflecting distinct clinical attributes. Experiments on MRG with MIMIC and medical VQA on EHRXQA demonstrate that HyperWalker achieves state-of-the-art performance.

While substantial progress has been made in offline RL and off-policy RL settings, integrating diffusion policies into on-policy frameworks like PPO remains underexplored. This gap is particularly significant given the widespread use of large-scale parallel GPU-accelerated simulators, such as IsaacLab, which are optimized for on-policy RL algorithms and enable rapid training of complex robotic tasks. A key challenge lies in computing state-action log-likelihoods under diffusion policies, which is straightforward for Gaussian policies but intractable for flow-based models due to irreversible forward-reverse processes and discretization errors (e.g., Euler-Maruyama approximations). To bridge this gap, we propose GenPO, a generative policy optimization framework that leverages exact diffusion inversion to construct invertible action mappings. GenPO introduces a novel doubled dummy action mechanism that enables invertibility via alternating updates, resolving log-likelihood computation barriers. Furthermore, we also use the action log-likelihood for unbiased entropy and KL divergence estimation, enabling KL-adaptive learning rates and entropy regularization in on-policy updates. Extensive experiments on eight IsaacLab benchmarks, including legged locomotion (Ant, Humanoid, Anymal-D, Unitree H1, Go2), dexterous manipulation (Shadow Hand), aerial control (Quadcopter), and robotic arm tasks (Franka), demonstrate GenPO's superiority over existing RL baselines. Notably, GenPO is the first method to successfully integrate diffusion policies into on-policy RL, unlocking their potential for large-scale parallelized training and real-world robotic deployment.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional methods relied mainly on classical deterministic and probabilistic approaches, recent progress has benefited from supervised deep learning (DL) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to improve tract reconstruction. A persistent challenge in tractography is accurately reconstructing white matter tracts while minimizing spurious connections. To address this, we propose TractRLFusion, a novel GPT-based policy fusion framework that integrates multiple RL policies through a data-driven fusion strategy. Our method employs a two-stage training data selection process for effective policy fusion, followed by a multi-critic fine-tuning phase to enhance robustness and generalization. Experiments on HCP, ISMRM, and TractoInferno datasets demonstrate that TractRLFusion outperforms individual RL policies as well as state-of-the-art classical and DRL methods in accuracy and anatomical reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 23rd IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI), 2026</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Agentic RL with Progressive Reward Shaping and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07478v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) empowered with Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) can iteratively plan, call external tools, and integrate returned information to solve complex, long-horizon reasoning tasks. Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) optimizes such models over full tool-interaction trajectories, but two key challenges hinder effectiveness: (1) Sparse, non-instructive rewards, such as binary 0-1 verifiable signals, provide limited guidance for intermediate steps and slow convergence; (2) Gradient degradation in Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), where identical rewards within a rollout group yield zero advantage, which reducing sample efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary techniques: Progressive Reward Shaping (PRS) and Value-based Sampling Policy Optimization (VSPO). PRS is a curriculum-inspired reward design that introduces dense, stage-wise feedback - encouraging models to first master parseable and properly formatted tool calls, then optimize for factual correctness and answer quality. We instantiate PRS for short-form QA (with a length-aware BLEU to fairly score concise answers) and long-form QA (with LLM-as-a-Judge scoring to prevent reward hacking). VSPO is an enhanced GRPO variant that replaces zero advantages samples with prompts selected by a task-value metric balancing difficulty and uncertainty, and applies value-smoothing clipping to stabilize gradient updates. Experiments on multiple short-form and long-form QA benchmarks show that PRS consistently outperforms traditional binary rewards, and VSPO achieves superior stability, faster convergence, and higher final performance compared to SFT, PPO and GRPO baselines. Together, PRS and VSPO yield LLM-based TIR agents that generalize better across domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mathematical Framework for Custom Reward Functions in Job Application Evaluation using Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16073v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most of the traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) depend on strict matching using keywords, where candidates that are highly qualified are many times disqualified because of minor semantic differences. In this article, the two-stage process of developing a more comprehensive resume assessment system based on a small language model that is trained with fewer than 600M parameters is introduced and fine-tuned by using GRPO with a uniquely designed reward function. The initial stage is Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), which is used to create a strong base model with the ability to perceive resumes beyond superficial overlap of keywords. This SFT model is further optimized in the second step with Reinforcement Learning (RL) via GRPO with the help of multi-component-based rewarding, which will not be considered as a commission of tokens matching. In the initial RL experiments, we found a severe difficulty in the shape of reward hacking: overly aggressive penalty terms resulted in unstable training dynamics and prohibitively negative model behavior. This was solved by trial-and-error refinement of the reward and careful training hyperparameter tuning, which led to a stable and controlled process of gentle polishing. The GRPO-refined model shows high real-life performance, as it shows an accuracy of 91% on unseen data used for testing. It has a high recall of 0.85 on the SELECTED class with a perfect precision of 1.0, which highlights its high reliability for identifying qualified applicants. These findings demonstrate that an appropriately structured two-step fine-tuning pipeline can effectively be used to transfer a small language model into human-like candidate evaluation, surpassing the shortcomings of both traditional ATS systems and unrefined uses of reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures, 2 equations, 3 Tables</p></details> |

Current methods for shaping LRM behavior typically rely on reinforcement learning or fine-tuning with gold-standard reasoning traces, a paradigm that is both computationally expensive and difficult to scale. In this paper, we reveal that LRMs possess latent \textit{reasoning beliefs} that internally track their own reasoning traits, which can be captured through simple logit probing. Building upon this insight, we propose Reasoning Belief Engineering (RELIEF), a simple yet effective framework that shapes LRM behavior by aligning the model's self-concept with a target belief blueprint. Crucially, RELIEF completely bypasses the need for reasoning-trace supervision. It internalizes desired traits by fine-tuning on synthesized, self-reflective question-answering pairs that affirm the target belief. Extensive experiments on efficiency and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that RELIEF matches or outperforms behavior-supervised and preference-based baselines while requiring lower training costs. Further analysis validates that shifting a model's reasoning belief effectively shapes its actual behavior.</p></details> | Working in progress |

However, existing LLM reasoning strategies mainly rely on the LLM itself with fast or slow mode (like o1 thinking) and thus struggle to balance reasoning efficiency and accuracy across queries of varying difficulties. In this paper, we propose Cognitive-Inspired Elastic Reasoning (CogER), a framework inspired by human hierarchical reasoning that dynamically selects the most suitable reasoning strategy for each query. Specifically, CogER first assesses the complexity of incoming queries and assigns them to one of several predefined levels, each corresponding to a tailored processing strategy, thereby addressing the challenge of unobservable query difficulty. To achieve automatic strategy selection, we model the process as a Markov Decision Process and train a CogER-Agent using reinforcement learning. The agent is guided by a reward function that balances solution quality and computational cost, ensuring resource-efficient reasoning. Moreover, for queries requiring external tools, we introduce Cognitive Tool-Assisted Reasoning, which enables the LLM to autonomously invoke external tools within its chain-of-thought. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CogER outperforms state-of-the-art Test-Time scaling methods, achieving at least a 13% relative improvement in average exact match on In-Domain tasks and an 8% relative gain on Out-of-Domain tasks.</p></details> | under review |

However, compared with traditional wireless networks, LAWNs face unique security challenges due to low-altitude operations, frequent mobility and reliance on unlicensed spectrum, making it more vulnerable to some malicious attacks. In this paper, we investigate some large artificial intelligence model (LAM)-enabled solutions for secure communications in LAWNs. Specifically, we first explore the amplified security risks and important limitations of traditional AI methods in LAWNs. Then, we introduce the basic concepts of LAMs and delve into the role of LAMs in addressing these challenges. To demonstrate the practical benefits of LAMs for secure communications in LAWNs, we propose a novel LAM-based optimization framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate enhanced state features on top of handcrafted representations, and to design intrinsic rewards accordingly, thereby improving reinforcement learning performance for secure communication tasks. Through a typical case study, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we outline future directions for integrating LAMs into secure LAWN applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted in healthcare due to their extensive knowledge reserves, retrieval, and communication capabilities. While LLMs show promise and excel at medical benchmarks, their diagnostic reasoning and inquiry skills are constrained. To mitigate this issue, we propose (1) Clinical Diagnostic Reasoning Data (CDRD) structure to capture abstract clinical reasoning logic, and a pipeline for its construction, and (2) the Dr. Assistant, a clinical diagnostic model equipped with clinical reasoning and inquiry skills. Its training involves a two-stage process: SFT, followed by RL with a tailored reward function. We also introduce a benchmark to evaluate both diagnostic reasoning and inquiry.

Leveraging the global control capabilities of a geostationary (GEO)-resident software-defined networking (SDN) controller, we introduce opportunistic routing, which aims to minimize delivery delay by forwarding packets to any currently available ground gateways rather than fixed destinations. This makes it a promising approach for achieving low-latency and robust data delivery in highly dynamic LEO networks. Specifically, we formulate a constrained stochastic optimization problem and employ a residual reinforcement learning framework to optimize opportunistic routing for reducing transmission delay. Simulation results over multiple days of orbital data demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements in queue length reduction compared to classical backpressure and other well-known queueing algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Models trained on noisy data are prone to overfitting, which degrades their generalization performance. While a number of methods and strategies have been proposed to mitigate noisy labels in the segmentation domain, this area remains largely under-explored. The abstention mechanism has proven effective in classification tasks by enhancing the capabilities of Cross Entropy, yet its potential in segmentation remains unverified. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a universal and modular abstention framework capable of enhancing the noise-robustness of a diverse range of loss functions. Our framework improves upon prior work with two key components: an informed regularization term to guide abstention behaviour, and a more flexible power-law-based auto-tuning algorithm for the abstention penalty. We demonstrate the framework's versatility by systematically integrating it with three distinct loss functions to create three novel, noise-robust variants: GAC, SAC, and ADS. Experiments on the CaDIS and DSAD medical datasets show our methods consistently and significantly outperform their non-abstaining baselines, especially under high noise levels. This work establishes that enabling models to selectively ignore corrupted samples is a powerful and generalizable strategy for building more reliable segmentation models.

Recent USS methods extract pixel-level features using frozen visual foundation models and refine them through self-supervised objectives that encourage semantic grouping. These features are then grouped to semantic clusters to produce segmentation masks. Extending these ideas to federated settings requires feature representation and cluster centroid alignment across distributed clients, an inherently difficult task under heterogeneous data distributions in the absence of supervision. To address this, we propose FUSS (Federated Unsupervised image Semantic Segmentation) which is, to our knowledge, the first framework to enable fully decentralized, label-free semantic segmentation training. FUSS introduces novel federation strategies that promote global consistency in feature and prototype space, jointly optimizing local segmentation heads and shared semantic centroids. Experiments on both benchmark and real-world datasets, including binary and multi-class segmentation tasks, show that FUSS consistently outperforms local-only client trainings as well as extensions of classical FL algorithms under varying client data distributions.

To ensure stable training and avoid computational instabilities, we incorporate signed between-class variance, bound outputs with a sigmoid function, and convert multiplicative relationships into additive ones. We present two stable DDA loss functions and augment them with a probability loss, resulting in Probabilistic DDA (PDDA). PDDA effectively minimizes class overlap in output distributions, producing highly confident predictions with reduced within-class variance. When applied to wind blade segmentation, PDDA showcases notable advances in performance and consistency, critical for wind energy maintenance.

Yet, existing AL methods are unable to consistently outperform improved random sampling baselines adapted to 3D data, leaving the field without a reliable solution. We introduce Class-stratified Scheduled Power Predictive Entropy (ClaSP PE), a simple and effective query strategy that addresses two key limitations of standard uncertainty-based AL methods: class imbalance and redundancy in early selections. ClaSP PE combines class-stratified querying to ensure coverage of underrepresented structures and log-scale power noising with a decaying schedule to enforce query diversity in early-stage AL and encourage exploitation later. In our evaluation on 24 experimental settings using four 3D biomedical datasets within the comprehensive nnActive benchmark, ClaSP PE is the only method that generally outperforms improved random baselines in terms of both segmentation quality with statistically significant gains, whilst remaining annotation efficient. Furthermore, we explicitly simulate the real-world application by testing our method on four previously unseen datasets without manual adaptation, where all experiment parameters are set according to predefined guidelines. The results confirm that ClaSP PE robustly generalizes to novel tasks without requiring dataset-specific tuning. Within the nnActive framework, we present compelling evidence that an AL method can consistently outperform random baselines adapted to 3D segmentation, in terms of both performance and annotation efficiency in a realistic, close-to-production scenario. Our open-source implementation and clear deployment guidelines make it readily applicable in practice. Code is at https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnActive.</p></details> | Accepted at TMLR |

However, existing methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective: highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU.

| **[Jordan-Segmentable Masks: A Topology-Aware definition for characterizing Binary Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10577v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions. In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $β_0 = β_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components. This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.</p></details> | 27 pages, 18 figures |

We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames. Our best model based on a combination of SeTR-MLA+XMem2 outperforms prior work (e.g., improving over FoodMem by ~2.63% mAP), offering new insights into food segmentation and tracking for dietary analysis. In addition to frame-wise spatial accuracy, we introduce a dedicated temporal evaluation protocol that explicitly quantifies segmentation stability over time through continuity, flicker rate, and IoU drift metrics. This allows us to reveal failure modes that remain invisible under standard per-frame evaluations. We release BenchSeg to foster future research.

| **[Segment and Matte Anything in a Unified Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12147v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything (SAM) has recently pushed the boundaries of segmentation by demonstrating zero-shot generalization and flexible prompting after training on over one billion masks. Despite this, its mask prediction accuracy often falls short of the precision required in real-world applications. While several refinement modules have been proposed to boost SAM's segmentation quality, achieving highly accurate object delineation within a single, unified framework remains an open challenge. Furthermore, interactive image matting, which aims to generate fine-grained alpha mattes guided by diverse user hints, has not yet been explored in the context of SAM. Insights from recent studies highlight strong correlations between segmentation and matting, suggesting the feasibility of a unified model capable of both tasks. In this paper, we introduce Segment And Matte Anything (SAMA), a lightweight extension of SAM that delivers high-quality interactive image segmentation and matting with minimal extra parameters. Our Multi-View Localization Encoder (MVLE) captures detailed features from local views, while the Localization Adapter (Local-Adapter) refines mask outputs by recovering subtle boundary details. We also incorporate two prediction heads for each task into the architecture to generate segmentation and matting masks, simultaneously. Trained on a diverse dataset aggregated from publicly available sources, SAMA achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple segmentation and matting benchmarks, showcasing its adaptability and effectiveness in a wide range of downstream tasks.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Topology-Guaranteed Image Segmentation: Enforcing Connectivity, Genus, and Width Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11409v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing research highlights the crucial role of topological priors in image segmentation, particularly in preserving essential structures such as connectivity and genus. Accurately capturing these topological features often requires incorporating width-related information, including the thickness and length inherent to the image structures. However, traditional mathematical definitions of topological structures lack this dimensional width information, limiting methods like persistent homology from fully addressing practical segmentation needs. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel mathematical framework that explicitly integrates width information into the characterization of topological structures. This method leverages persistent homology, complemented by smoothing concepts from partial differential equations (PDEs), to modify local extrema of upper-level sets. This approach enables the resulting topological structures to inherently capture width properties. We incorporate this enhanced topological description into variational image segmentation models. Using some proper loss functions, we are also able to design neural networks that can segment images with the required topological and width properties. Through variational constraints on the relevant topological energies, our approach successfully preserves essential topological invariants such as connectivity and genus counts, simultaneously ensuring that segmented structures retain critical width attributes, including line thickness and length. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showcasing its capability to maintain topological fidelity while explicitly embedding width characteristics into segmented image structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal-SAM-LLM: Large Language Models as Causal Reasoners for Robust Medical Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03585v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The clinical utility of deep learning models for medical image segmentation is severely constrained by their inability to generalize to unseen domains. This failure is often rooted in the models learning spurious correlations between anatomical content and domain-specific imaging styles. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce Causal-SAM-LLM, a novel framework that elevates Large Language Models (LLMs) to the role of causal reasoners. Our framework, built upon a frozen Segment Anything Model (SAM) encoder, incorporates two synergistic innovations. First, Linguistic Adversarial Disentanglement (LAD) employs a Vision-Language Model to generate rich, textual descriptions of confounding image styles. By training the segmentation model's features to be contrastively dissimilar to these style descriptions, it learns a representation robustly purged of non-causal information. Second, Test-Time Causal Intervention (TCI) provides an interactive mechanism where an LLM interprets a clinician's natural language command to modulate the segmentation decoder's features in real-time, enabling targeted error correction. We conduct an extensive empirical evaluation on a composite benchmark from four public datasets (BTCV, CHAOS, AMOS, BraTS), assessing generalization under cross-scanner, cross-modality, and cross-anatomy settings. Causal-SAM-LLM establishes a new state of the art in out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness, improving the average Dice score by up to 6.2 points and reducing the Hausdorff Distance by 15.8 mm over the strongest baseline, all while using less than 9% of the full model's trainable parameters. Our work charts a new course for building robust, efficient, and interactively controllable medical AI systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Medical SAM3: A Foundation Model for Universal Prompt-Driven Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10880v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Promptable segmentation foundation models such as SAM3 have demonstrated strong generalization capabilities through interactive and concept-based prompting. However, their direct applicability to medical image segmentation remains limited by severe domain shifts, the absence of privileged spatial prompts, and the need to reason over complex anatomical and volumetric structures. Here we present Medical SAM3, a foundation model for universal prompt-driven medical image segmentation, obtained by fully fine-tuning SAM3 on large-scale, heterogeneous 2D and 3D medical imaging datasets with paired segmentation masks and text prompts. Through a systematic analysis of vanilla SAM3, we observe that its performance degrades substantially on medical data, with its apparent competitiveness largely relying on strong geometric priors such as ground-truth-derived bounding boxes. These findings motivate full model adaptation beyond prompt engineering alone. By fine-tuning SAM3's model parameters on 33 datasets spanning 10 medical imaging modalities, Medical SAM3 acquires robust domain-specific representations while preserving prompt-driven flexibility. Extensive experiments across organs, imaging modalities, and dimensionalities demonstrate consistent and significant performance gains, particularly in challenging scenarios characterized by semantic ambiguity, complex morphology, and long-range 3D context. Our results establish Medical SAM3 as a universal, text-guided segmentation foundation model for medical imaging and highlight the importance of holistic model adaptation for achieving robust prompt-driven segmentation under severe domain shift. Code and model will be made available at https://github.com/AIM-Research-Lab/Medical-SAM3.</p></details> |  |

While U-Net offers a favorable balance of accuracy and efficiency compared to large transformer-based models, achieving real-time performance on high-resolution input remains challenging due to compute, memory, and power limits. Extreme quantization, particularly binary networks, is appealing for its hardware-friendly operations. However, two obstacles limit practicality: (1) severe accuracy degradation, and (2) a lack of end-to-end implementations that deliver efficiency on general-purpose GPUs. We make two empirical observations that guide our design. (1) An explicit zero state is essential: training with zero masking to binary U-Net weights yields noticeable sparsity. (2) Quantization sensitivity is uniform across layers. Motivated by these findings, we introduce Masked Binary U-Net (MBU-Net), obtained through a cost-aware masking strategy that prioritizes masking where it yields the highest accuracy-per-cost, reconciling accuracy with near-binary efficiency. To realize these gains in practice, we develop a GPU execution framework that maps MBU-Net to Tensor Cores via a subtractive bit-encoding scheme, efficiently implementing masked binary weights with binary activations. This design leverages native binary Tensor Core BMMA instructions, enabling high throughput and energy savings on widely available GPUs. Across 3 segmentation benchmarks, MBU-Net attains near full-precision accuracy (3% average drop) while delivering 2.04x speedup and 3.54x energy reductions over a 16-bit floating point U-Net.</p></details> |  |

However, widespread use is hindered by high computational times and a black-box nature that inhibits user interaction. Human-in-the-loop TO approaches are emerging that integrate human intuition into the design generation process. However, these rely on the time-consuming bottleneck of iterative region selection for design modifications. To reduce the number of iterative trials, this contribution presents an AI co-pilot that uses machine learning to predict the user's preferred regions. The prediction model is configured as an image segmentation task with a U-Net architecture. It is trained on synthetic datasets where human preferences either identify the longest topological member or the most complex structural connection. The model successfully predicts plausible regions for modification and presents them to the user as AI recommendations. The human preference model demonstrates generalization across diverse and non-standard TO problems and exhibits emergent behavior outside the single-region selection training data. Demonstration examples show that the new human-in-the-loop TO approach that integrates the AI co-pilot can improve manufacturability or improve the linear buckling load by 39% while only increasing the total design time by 15 sec compared to conventional simplistic TO.</p></details> | 21 pages, 10 figures |

Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable performance in various segmentation tasks, its application to RRSIS presents several challenges, including understanding the text-described RS scenes and generating effective prompts from text. To address these issues, we propose \textbf{RS2-SAM2}, a novel framework that adapts SAM2 to RRSIS by aligning the adapted RS features and textual features while providing pseudo-mask-based dense prompts. Specifically, we employ a union encoder to jointly encode the visual and textual inputs, generating aligned visual and text embeddings as well as multimodal class tokens. A bidirectional hierarchical fusion module is introduced to adapt SAM2 to RS scenes and align adapted visual features with the visually enhanced text embeddings, improving the model's interpretation of text-described RS scenes. To provide precise target cues for SAM2, we design a mask prompt generator, which takes the visual embeddings and class tokens as input and produces a pseudo-mask as the dense prompt of SAM2. Experimental results on several RRSIS benchmarks demonstrate that RS2-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities.

However, many existing perturbation methods rely on dropout, and thus require a careful manual tuning of the dropout rate, which is a sensitive hyperparameter and often difficult to optimize and may lead to suboptimal regularization. To overcome this limitation, we propose VQ-Seg, the first approach to employ vector quantization (VQ) to discretize the feature space and introduce a novel and controllable Quantized Perturbation Module (QPM) that replaces dropout. Our QPM perturbs discrete representations by shuffling the spatial locations of codebook indices, enabling effective and controllable regularization. To mitigate potential information loss caused by quantization, we design a dual-branch architecture where the post-quantization feature space is shared by both image reconstruction and segmentation tasks. Moreover, we introduce a Post-VQ Feature Adapter (PFA) to incorporate guidance from a foundation model (FM), supplementing the high-level semantic information lost during quantization. Furthermore, we collect a large-scale Lung Cancer (LC) dataset comprising 828 CT scans annotated for central-type lung carcinoma. Extensive experiments on the LC dataset and other public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Its design allows seamless integration into deep classical neural networks, making it particularly suitable for hybrid quantum-classical models. As an application of QuFeX, we propose Qu-Net -- a hybrid architecture which integrates QuFeX at the bottleneck of a U-Net architecture. The latter is widely used for image segmentation tasks such as medical imaging and autonomous driving. Our numerical analysis indicates that the Qu-Net can achieve superior segmentation performance compared to a U-Net baseline. These results highlight the potential of QuFeX to enhance deep neural networks by leveraging hybrid computational paradigms, providing a path towards a robust framework for real-world applications requiring precise feature extraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: 1...</summary><p>V2: 17 pages, 15 figures, 2 Tables; published version</p></details> |

Mainstream SSMIS methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

While high-capacity models achieve strong segmentation accuracy, their computational demands hinder practical deployment and long-term maintainability in hospital environments. We present a deployment-oriented framework that leverages knowledge distillation to translate a high-performing segmentation model into a scalable family of compact student models, without modifying the inference pipeline. The proposed approach preserves architectural compatibility with existing clinical systems while enabling systematic capacity reduction. The framework is evaluated on a multi-site brain MRI dataset comprising 1,104 3D volumes, with independent testing on 101 curated cases, and is further examined on abdominal CT to assess cross-modality generalizability. Under aggressive parameter reduction (94%), the distilled student model preserves nearly all of the teacher's segmentation accuracy (98.7%), while achieving substantial efficiency gains, including up to a 67% reduction in CPU inference latency without additional deployment overhead. These results demonstrate that knowledge distillation provides a practical and reliable pathway for converting research-grade segmentation models into maintainable, deployment-ready components for on-premises clinical workflows in real-world health systems.</p></details> |  |

Lightweight architectures typically suffer significant performance loss. To address these deployment and speed constraints, we propose Region- and Context-aware Knowledge Distillation (ReCo-KD), a training-only framework that transfers both fine-grained anatomical detail and long-range contextual information from a high-capacity teacher to a compact student network. The framework integrates Multi-Scale Structure-Aware Region Distillation (MS-SARD), which applies class-aware masks and scale-normalized weighting to emphasize small but clinically important regions, and Multi-Scale Context Alignment (MS-CA), which aligns teacher-student affinity patterns across feature levels. Implemented on nnU-Net in a backbone-agnostic manner, ReCo-KD requires no custom student design and is easily adapted to other architectures. Experiments on multiple public 3D medical segmentation datasets and a challenging aggregated dataset show that the distilled lightweight model attains accuracy close to the teacher while markedly reducing parameters and inference latency, underscoring its practicality for clinical deployment.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Traditional approaches typically employ contrastive learning, treating paired image-report samples as positives and unpaired ones as negatives. However, in medical datasets, there can be substantial similarities between images or reports from different patients. Rigidly treating all unpaired samples as negatives, can disrupt the underlying semantic structure and negatively impact the quality of the learned representations. In this paper, we propose a multi-level alignment framework, Representation Learning with Semantic-aware Instance and Sparse Token Alignments (SISTA) by exploiting the semantic correspondence between medical image and radiology reports at two levels, i.e., image-report and patch-word levels. Specifically, we improve the conventional contrastive learning by incorporating inter-report similarity to eliminate the false negatives and introduce a method to effectively align image patches with relevant word tokens. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework in improving transfer performance across different datasets on three downstream tasks: image classification, image segmentation, and object detection. Notably, our framework achieves significant improvements in fine-grained tasks even with limited labeled data.

Recently, self-supervised foundation models such as DINOv3, which were trained on large natural image datasets, have shown strong potential for dense feature extraction that can help with the few-shot learning challenge. Yet, their direct application to medical images is hindered by domain differences. In this work, we propose DINO-AugSeg, a novel framework that leverages DINOv3 features to address the few-shot medical image segmentation challenge. Specifically, we introduce WT-Aug, a wavelet-based feature-level augmentation module that enriches the diversity of DINOv3-extracted features by perturbing frequency components, and CG-Fuse, a contextual information-guided fusion module that exploits cross-attention to integrate semantic-rich low-resolution features with spatially detailed high-resolution features. Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks spanning five imaging modalities, including MRI, CT, ultrasound, endoscopy, and dermoscopy, demonstrate that DINO-AugSeg consistently outperforms existing methods under limited-sample conditions. The results highlight the effectiveness of incorporating wavelet-domain augmentation and contextual fusion for robust feature representation, suggesting DINO-AugSeg as a promising direction for advancing few-shot medical image segmentation.

Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains difficult. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground the image segmentation process via text inputs. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

However, object detection models rely on costly bounding box annotations, limiting scalability. Weakly Semi-Supervised Object Detection (WSSOD) with point annotations proposes annotating each instance with a single point, minimizing annotation time while preserving localization signals. A Point-to-Box teacher model, trained on a small box-labeled subset, converts these point annotations into pseudo-box labels to train a student detector. Yet, medical imagery presents unique challenges, including overlapping anatomy, variable object sizes, and elusive structures, which hinder accurate bounding box inference. To overcome these challenges, we introduce DExTeR (DETR with Experts), a transformer-based Point-to-Box regressor tailored for medical imaging. Built upon Point-DETR, DExTeR encodes single-point annotations as object queries, refining feature extraction with the proposed class-guided deformable attention, which guides attention sampling using point coordinates and class labels to capture class-specific characteristics. To improve discrimination in complex structures, it introduces CLICK-MoE (CLass, Instance, and Common Knowledge Mixture of Experts), decoupling class and instance representations to reduce confusion among adjacent or overlapping instances. Finally, we implement a multi-point training strategy which promotes prediction consistency across different point placements, improving robustness to annotation variability. DExTeR achieves state-of-the-art performance across three datasets spanning different medical domains (endoscopy, chest X-rays, and endoscopic ultrasound) highlighting its potential to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high detection accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Despite the potential of recent vision-based methods, they encounter challenges under adverse conditions. Thus, integrating cameras with next-generation 4D imaging radar to achieve unified multi-task perception is highly significant, though research in this domain remains limited. In this paper, we propose Doracamom, the first framework that fuses multi-view cameras and 4D radar for joint 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction, enabling comprehensive environmental perception. Specifically, we introduce a novel Coarse Voxel Queries Generator that integrates geometric priors from 4D radar with semantic features from images to initialize voxel queries, establishing a robust foundation for subsequent Transformer-based refinement. To leverage temporal information, we design a Dual-Branch Temporal Encoder that processes multi-modal temporal features in parallel across BEV and voxel spaces, enabling comprehensive spatio-temporal representation learning. Furthermore, we propose a Cross-Modal BEV-Voxel Fusion module that adaptively fuses complementary features through attention mechanisms while employing auxiliary tasks to enhance feature quality. Extensive experiments on the OmniHD-Scenes, View-of-Delft (VoD), and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that Doracamom achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tasks, establishing new benchmarks for multi-modal 3D perception.

To bridge multi-scale radar features and the decoder, we propose Pyramid Token Fusion (PTF), a lightweight module that converts a feature pyramid into a unified, scale-aware token sequence. By formulating detection as a set prediction problem with learnable object queries and positional encodings, our design models long-range spatial-temporal correlations and cross-feature interactions. This approach eliminates dense proposal generation and heuristic post-processing such as extensive non-maximum suppression (NMS) tuning. We evaluate the proposed framework on the RADDet, where it achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art radar-only baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Practical Insights into Semi-Supervised Object Detection Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13380v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning in data-scarce settings has recently gained significant attention in the research community. Semi-supervised object detection(SSOD) aims to improve detection performance by leveraging a large number of unlabeled images alongside a limited number of labeled images(a.k.a.,few-shot learning). In this paper, we present a comprehensive comparison of three state-of-the-art SSOD approaches, including MixPL, Semi-DETR and Consistent-Teacher, with the goal of understanding how performance varies with the number of labeled images. We conduct experiments using the MS-COCO and Pascal VOC datasets, two popular object detection benchmarks which allow for standardized evaluation. In addition, we evaluate the SSOD approaches on a custom Beetle dataset which enables us to gain insights into their performance on specialized datasets with a smaller number of object categories. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between accuracy, model size, and latency, providing insights into which methods are best suited for low-data regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infrared Object Detection with Ultra Small ConvNets: Is ImageNet Pretraining Still Useful?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02927v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models, pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with less than 1M parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working conditions are different.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026</p></details> |

The device translates visual scene understanding into intuitive tactile feedback on the temples, allowing hands-free navigation. Three studies evaluate the system: recognition of 13 haptic patterns with an average recognition rate of 81.3%, VICON-based guidance with predefined paths using haptic cues, and an LLM-guided scene evaluation with decision accuracies of 91.8% without obstacles, 84.6% with static obstacles, and 81.5% with dynamic obstacles. These results show that LLM-Glasses can deliver reliable navigation support in controlled environments and motivate further work on responsiveness and deployment in more complex real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[AsyncBEV: Cross-modal Flow Alignment in Asynchronous 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12994v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autonomous driving, multi-modal perception tasks like 3D object detection typically rely on well-synchronized sensors, both at training and inference. However, despite the use of hardware- or software-based synchronization algorithms, perfect synchrony is rarely guaranteed: Sensors may operate at different frequencies, and real-world factors such as network latency, hardware failures, or processing bottlenecks often introduce time offsets between sensors. Such asynchrony degrades perception performance, especially for dynamic objects. To address this challenge, we propose AsyncBEV, a trainable lightweight and generic module to improve the robustness of 3D Birds' Eye View (BEV) object detection models against sensor asynchrony. Inspired by scene flow estimation, AsyncBEV first estimates the 2D flow from the BEV features of two different sensor modalities, taking into account the known time offset between these sensor measurements. The predicted feature flow is then used to warp and spatially align the feature maps, which we show can easily be integrated into different current BEV detector architectures (e.g., BEV grid-based and token-based). Extensive experiments demonstrate AsyncBEV improves robustness against both small and large asynchrony between LiDAR or camera sensors in both the token-based CMT and grid-based UniBEV, especially for dynamic objects. We significantly outperform the ego motion compensated CMT and UniBEV baselines, notably by $16.6$ % and $11.9$ % NDS on dynamic objects in the worst-case scenario of a $0.5 s$ time offset. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Within the area of object recognition, we propose and develop architectures tailored for MINT models. These architectures aim to optimize performance and efficiency in data utilization, offering a tailored solution to tackle the complexities inherent in the object recognition domain. We conducted experiments involving an object detection model, an embedding extractor, and a MINT module. These experiments were performed in three public databases, totaling over 174K images. The proposed architecture leverages convolutional layers to capture and model the activation patterns present in the data during the training process. Through our analysis, we are able to identify given data used for testing and training, achieving precision rates ranging between 70% and 80%, contingent upon the depth of the detection module layer chosen for input to the MINT module. Additionally, our studies entail an analysis of the factors influencing the MINT Module, delving into the contributing elements behind more transparent training processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Deplo...</summary><p>Deployable AI (DAI 2025) workshop co-located with AAAI-25</p></details> |
| **[YOLO26: An Analysis of NMS-Free End to End Framework for Real-Time Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12882v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The "You Only Look Once" (YOLO) framework has long served as the benchmark for real-time object detection, yet traditional iterations (YOLOv1 through YOLO11) remain constrained by the latency and hyperparameter sensitivity of Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) post-processing. This paper analyzes a comprehensive analysis of YOLO26, an architecture that fundamentally redefines this paradigm by eliminating NMS in favor of a native end-to-end learning strategy. This study examines the critical innovations that enable this transition, specifically the introduction of the MuSGD optimizer for stabilizing lightweight backbones, STAL for small-target-aware assignment, and ProgLoss for dynamic supervision. Through a systematic review of official performance benchmarks, the results demonstrate that YOLO26 establishes a new Pareto front, outperforming a comprehensive suite of predecessors and state-of-the-art competitors (including RTMDet and DAMO-YOLO) in both inference speed and detection accuracy. The analysis confirms that by decoupling representation learning from heuristic post-processing, YOLOv26 successfully resolves the historical trade-off between latency and precision, signaling the next evolutionary step in edge-based computer vision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Unbiased Source-Free Object Detection via Vision Foundation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12765v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has garnered much attention in recent years by eliminating the need of source-domain data in cross-domain tasks, but existing SFOD methods suffer from the Source Bias problem, i.e. the adapted model remains skewed towards the source domain, leading to poor generalization and error accumulation during self-training. To overcome this challenge, we propose Debiased Source-free Object Detection (DSOD), a novel VFM-assisted SFOD framework that can effectively mitigate source bias with the help of powerful VFMs. Specifically, we propose Unified Feature Injection (UFI) module that integrates VFM features into the CNN backbone through Simple-Scale Extension (SSE) and Domain-aware Adaptive Weighting (DAAW). Then, we propose Semantic-aware Feature Regularization (SAFR) that constrains feature learning to prevent overfitting to source domain characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a VFM-free variant, termed DSOD-distill for computation-restricted scenarios through a novel Dual-Teacher distillation scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DSOD outperforms state-of-the-art SFOD methods, achieving 48.1% AP on Normal-to-Foggy weather adaptation, 39.3% AP on Cross-scene adaptation, and 61.4% AP on Synthetic-to-Real adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSOD: Reliability-Guided Sonar Image Object Detection with Extremely Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12715v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in sonar images is a key technology in underwater detection systems. Compared to natural images, sonar images contain fewer texture details and are more susceptible to noise, making it difficult for non-experts to distinguish subtle differences between classes. This leads to their inability to provide precise annotation data for sonar images. Therefore, designing effective object detection methods for sonar images with extremely limited labels is particularly important. To address this, we propose a teacher-student framework called RSOD, which aims to fully learn the characteristics of sonar images and develop a pseudo-label strategy suitable for these images to mitigate the impact of limited labels. First, RSOD calculates a reliability score by assessing the consistency of the teacher's predictions across different views. To leverage this score, we introduce an object mixed pseudo-label method to tackle the shortage of labeled data in sonar images. Finally, we optimize the performance of the student by implementing a reliability-guided adaptive constraint. By taking full advantage of unlabeled data, the student can perform well even in situations with extremely limited labels. Notably, on the UATD dataset, our method, using only 5% of labeled data, achieves results that can compete against those of our baseline algorithm trained on 100% labeled data. We also collected a new dataset to provide more valuable data for research in the field of sonar.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026,9 pages,10 figures</p></details> |

We propose BlockSecRT-DETR, a BLOCKchain-SECured Real-Time Object DEtection TRansformer framework for ITS that provides a decentralized, token-efficient, and privacy-preserving federated training solution using RT-DETR transformer, incorporating a blockchain-secured update validation mechanism for trustworthy aggregation. In this framework, challenges (1) and (2) are jointly addressed through a unified client-side design that integrates RT-DETR training with a Token Engineering Module (TEM). TEM prunes low-utility tokens, reducing encoder complexity and latency on edge hardware, while aggregated updates mitigate non-IID data heterogeneity across clients. To address challenge (3), BlockSecRT-DETR incorporates a decentralized blockchain-secured update validation mechanism that enables tamper-proof, privacy-preserving, and trust-free authenticated model aggregation without relying on a central server. We evaluated the proposed framework under a missing-class Non-IID partition of the KITTI dataset and conducted a blockchain case study to quantify security overhead. TEM improves inference latency by 17.2% and reduces encoder FLOPs by 47.8%, while maintaining global detection accuracy (89.20% mAP@0.5). The blockchain integration adds 400 ms per round, and the ledger size remains under 12 KB due to metadata-only on-chain storage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed Precision PointPillars for Efficient 3D Object Detection with TensorRT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12638v1)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LIDAR 3D object detection is one of the important tasks for autonomous vehicles. Ensuring that this task operates in real-time is crucial. Toward this, model quantization can be used to accelerate the runtime. However, directly applying model quantization often leads to performance degradation due to LIDAR's wide numerical distributions and extreme outliers. To address the wide numerical distribution, we proposed a mixed precision framework designed for PointPillars. Our framework first searches for sensitive layers with post-training quantization (PTQ) by quantizing one layer at a time to 8-bit integer (INT8) and evaluating each model for average precision (AP). The top-k most sensitive layers are assigned as floating point (FP). Combinations of these layers are greedily searched to produce candidate mixed precision models, which are finalized with either PTQ or quantization-aware training (QAT). Furthermore, to handle outliers, we observe that using a very small number of calibration data reduces the likelihood of encountering outliers, thereby improving PTQ performance. Our methods provides mixed precision models without training in the PTQ pipeline, while our QAT pipeline achieves the performance competitive to FP models. With TensorRT deployment, our models offer less latency and sizes by up to 2.35 and 2.26 times, respectively.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |
| **[SDCoNet: Saliency-Driven Multi-Task Collaborative Network for Remote Sensing Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12507v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In remote sensing images, complex backgrounds, weak object signals, and small object scales make accurate detection particularly challenging, especially under low-quality imaging conditions. A common strategy is to integrate single-image super-resolution (SR) before detection; however, such serial pipelines often suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, feature redundancy, and a lack of effective interaction between SR and detection. To address these issues, we propose a Saliency-Driven multi-task Collaborative Network (SDCoNet) that couples SR and detection through implicit feature sharing while preserving task specificity. SDCoNet employs the swin transformer-based shared encoder, where hierarchical window-shifted self-attention supports cross-task feature collaboration and adaptively balances the trade-off between texture refinement and semantic representation. In addition, a multi-scale saliency prediction module produces importance scores to select key tokens, enabling focused attention on weak object regions, suppression of background clutter, and suppression of adverse features introduced by multi-task coupling. Furthermore, a gradient routing strategy is introduced to mitigate optimization conflicts. It first stabilizes detection semantics and subsequently routes SR gradients along a detection-oriented direction, enabling the framework to guide the SR branch to generate high-frequency details that are explicitly beneficial for detection. Experiments on public datasets, including NWPU VHR-10-Split, DOTAv1.5-Split, and HRSSD-Split, demonstrate that the proposed method, while maintaining competitive computational efficiency, significantly outperforms existing mainstream algorithms in small object detection on low-quality remote sensing images. Our code is available at https://github.com/qiruo-ya/SDCoNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multimodal Assistive System for Product Localization and Retrieval for People who are Blind or have Low Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12486v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shopping is a routine activity for sighted individuals, yet for people who are blind or have low vision (pBLV), locating and retrieving products in physical environments remains a challenge. This paper presents a multimodal wearable assistive system that integrates object detection with vision-language models to support independent product or item retrieval, with the goal of enhancing users'autonomy and sense of agency. The system operates through three phases: product search, which identifies target products using YOLO-World detection combined with embedding similarity and color histogram matching; product navigation, which provides spatialized sonification and VLM-generated verbal descriptions to guide users toward the target; and product correction, which verifies whether the user has reached the correct product and provides corrective feedback when necessary. Technical evaluation demonstrated promising performance across all modules, with product detection achieving near-perfect accuracy at close range and high accuracy when facing shelves within 1.5 m. VLM-based navigation achieved up to 94.4% accuracy, and correction accuracy exceeded 86% under optimal model configurations. These results demonstrate the system's potential to address the last-meter problem in assistive shopping. Future work will focus on user studies with pBLV participants and integration with multi-scale navigation ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RemoteDet-Mamba: A Hybrid Mamba-CNN Network for Multi-modal Object Detection in Remote Sensing Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13532v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, with its advantages of rapid information acquisition and low cost, has been widely applied in scenarios such as emergency response. However, due to the long imaging distance and complex imaging mechanisms, targets in remote sensing images often face challenges such as small object size, dense distribution, and low inter-class discriminability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-modal remote sensing object detection network called RemoteDet-Mamba, which is based on a patch-level four-direction selective scanning fusion strategy. This method simultaneously learns unimodal local features and fuses cross-modal patch-level global semantic information, thereby enhancing the distinguishability of small objects and improving inter-class discrimination. Furthermore, the designed lightweight fusion mechanism effectively decouples densely packed targets while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the DroneVehicle dataset demonstrate that RemoteDet-Mamba achieves superior detection performance compared to current mainstream methods, while maintaining low parameter count and computational overhead, showing promising potential for practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |

The proposed architecture is composed of two stacks running simultaneously, an on-board driving stack that includes a stereo camera for scene understanding, and a digital twin stack that runs an Unreal Engine 5 replica of the scene viewed by the camera as well as returning safety alerts to the cockpit. The on-board stack is implemented on the vehicle side including 2 main autonomous modules; localization and perception. The position and orientation of the ego vehicle are obtained using on-board sensors. Furthermore, the perception module is responsible for processing 20-fps images from stereo camera and understands the scene through two complementary pipelines. The pipeline are working on object detection and feature extraction including object velocity, yaw and the safety metrics time-to-collision and time-headway. The collected data form the driving stack are sent to the infrastructure side through the ROS-enabled architecture in the form of custom ROS2 messages and sent over UDP links that ride a 4G modem for V2I communication. The environment is monitored via the digital twin through the shared messages which update the information of the spawned ego vehicle and detected objects based on the real-time localization and perception data. Several tests with different driving scenarios to confirm the validity and real-time response of the proposed architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMc2f: Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12010v1)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The safety validation of autonomous robotic vehicles hinges on systematically testing their planning and control stacks against rare, safety-critical scenarios. Mining these long-tail events from massive real-world driving logs is therefore a critical step in the robotic development lifecycle. The goal of the Scenario Mining task is to retrieve useful information to enable targeted re-simulation, regression testing, and failure analysis of the robot's decision-making algorithms. RefAV, introduced by the Argoverse team, is an end-to-end framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to spatially and temporally localize scenarios described in natural language. However, this process performs retrieval on trajectory labels, ignoring the direct connection between natural language and raw RGB images, which runs counter to the intuition of video retrieval; it also depends on the quality of upstream 3D object detection and tracking. Further, inaccuracies in trajectory data lead to inaccuracies in downstream spatial and temporal localization. To address these issues, we propose Robust Scenario Mining for Robotic Autonomy from Coarse to Fine (SMc2f), a coarse-to-fine pipeline that employs vision-language models (VLMs) for coarse image-text filtering, builds a database of successful mining cases on top of RefAV and automatically retrieves exemplars to few-shot condition the LLM for more robust retrieval, and introduces text-trajectory contrastive learning to pull matched pairs together and push mismatched pairs apart in a shared embedding space, yielding a fine-grained matcher that refines the LLM's candidate trajectories. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate substantial gains in both retrieval quality and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

Traditional wheelchairs lack dynamic features, and many smart alternatives remain costly, single-modality, and limited in health integration. Motivated by the pressing demand for advanced, personalized, and affordable assistive technologies, we propose a comprehensive AI-IoT based smart wheelchair system that incorporates glove-based gesture control for hands-free navigation, real-time object detection using YOLOv8 with auditory feedback for obstacle avoidance, and ultrasonic for immediate collision avoidance. Vital signs (heart rate, SpO$_2$, ECG, temperature) are continuously monitored, uploaded to ThingSpeak, and trigger email alerts for critical conditions. Built on a modular and low-cost architecture, the gesture control achieved a 95.5\% success rate, ultrasonic obstacle detection reached 94\% accuracy, and YOLOv8-based object detection delivered 91.5\% Precision, 90.2\% Recall, and a 90.8\% F1-score. This integrated, multi-modal approach offers a practical, scalable, and affordable solution, significantly enhancing user autonomy, safety, and independence by bridging the gap between innovative research and real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |

This limits their holistic understanding and efficiency on low-power edge devices. To address this, we present a real-time multi-modal vision framework that integrates object detection, owner-specific face recognition, and emotion detection into a unified pipeline deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 edge platform. The core of our system is an adaptive scheduling mechanism that reduces computational load by 65\% compared to continuous processing by selectively activating modules such as, YOLOv8n for object detection, a custom FaceNet-based embedding system for facial recognition, and DeepFace's CNN for emotion classification. Experimental results demonstrate the system's efficacy, with the object detection module achieving an Average Precision (AP) of 0.861, facial recognition attaining 88\% accuracy, and emotion detection showing strong discriminatory power (AUC up to 0.97 for specific emotions), while operating at 5.6 frames per second. Our work demonstrates that context-aware scheduling is the key to unlocking complex multi-modal AI on cost-effective edge hardware, making intelligent perception more accessible and privacy-preserving.</p></details> |  |

Although myriads of large-scale pre-training efforts have built versatile foundation models that exhibit impressive zero-shot capabilities to facilitate OVOD, the necessity of creating a universal understanding for any object cognition according to already pretrained foundation models is usually overlooked. Therefore, in this paper, a training-free Guess What Vision Language Model, called GW-VLM, is proposed to form a universal understanding paradigm based on our carefully designed Multi-Scale Visual Language Searching (MS-VLS) coupled with Contextual Concept Prompt (CCP) for OVOD. This approach can engage a pre-trained Vision Language Model (VLM) and a Large Language Model (LLM) in the game of "guess what". Wherein, MS-VLS leverages multi-scale visual-language soft-alignment for VLM to generate snippets from the results of class-agnostic object detection, while CCP can form the concept of flow referring to MS-VLS and then make LLM understand snippets for OVOD. Finally, the extensive experiments are carried out on natural and remote sensing datasets, including COCO val, Pascal VOC, DIOR, and NWPU-10, and the results indicate that our proposed GW-VLM can achieve superior OVOD performance compared to the-state-of-the-art methods without any training step.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches depend heavily on manual monitoring, resulting in limited scalability and operational inefficiencies. This work introduces a dual-task model based on EfficientNetB4 capable of performing airborne object classification and threat-level prediction simultaneously. To address the scarcity of clean, balanced training data, we constructed the AODTA Dataset by aggregating and refining multiple public sources. We benchmarked our approach on both the AVD Dataset and the newly developed AODTA Dataset and further compared performance against a ResNet-50 baseline, which consistently underperformed EfficientNetB4. Our EfficientNetB4 model achieved 96% accuracy in object classification and 90% accuracy in threat-level prediction, underscoring its promise for applications in surveillance, defense, and airspace management. Although the title references detection, this study focuses specifically on classification and threat-level inference using pre-localized airborne object images provided by existing datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recently, methods approaching the alignment of the intermediate features proven to be promising, achieving state-of-the-art results. However, these methods are laborious to implement and hard to interpret. Although promising, there is still room for improvements to close the performance gap toward the upper-bound (when training with the target data). In this work, we propose a method to generate an artificial dataset in the target domain to train an object detector. We employed two unsupervised image translators (CycleGAN and an AdaIN-based model) using only annotated data from the source domain and non-annotated data from the target domain. Our key contributions are the proposal of a less complex yet more effective method that also has an improved interpretability. Results on real-world scenarios for autonomous driving show significant improvements, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in most cases, further closing the gap toward the upper-bound.</p></details> |  |

Existing industrial systems typically couple object detection with taxonomy-based classification and rely on catalog data for evaluation, which is prone to noise that limits robustness and scalability. We propose a taxonomy-decoupled architecture that uses classification-free region proposals and unified embeddings for similarity retrieval, enabling a more flexible and generalizable visual search. To overcome the evaluation bottleneck, we propose an LLM-as-a-Judge framework that assesses nuanced visual similarity and category relevance for query-result pairs in a zero-shot manner, removing dependence on human annotations or noise-prone catalog data. Deployed at scale on a global home goods platform, our system improves retrieval quality and yields a measurable uplift in customer engagement, while our offline evaluation metrics strongly correlate with real-world outcomes.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>We de...</summary><p>We decided to withdraw the current arXiv version as the methodology and experimental conclusions are undergoing substantial revision, and the present version no longer accurately reflects our intended contribution</p></details> |

This paper presents a purpose-built lightweight object detection model designed to identify young pedestrians in various environmental scenarios. To address these challenges, our approach leverages thermal imaging from long-wave infrared (LWIR) cameras, which enhances detection reliability in conditions where traditional RGB cameras operating in the visible spectrum fail. Based on the YOLO11 architecture and customized for thermal detection, our model, termed LTV-YOLO (Lightweight Thermal Vision YOLO), is optimized for computational efficiency, accuracy and real-time performance on edge devices. By integrating separable convolutions in depth and a feature pyramid network (FPN), LTV-YOLO achieves strong performance in detecting small-scale, partially occluded, and thermally distinct VRUs while maintaining a compact architecture. This work contributes a practical and scalable solution to improve pedestrian safety in intelligent transportation systems, particularly in school zones, autonomous navigation, and smart city infrastructure. Unlike prior thermal detectors, our contribution is task-specific: a thermally only edge-capable design designed for young and small VRUs (children and distant adults). Although FPN and depthwise separable convolutions are standard components, their integration into a thermal-only pipeline optimized for short/occluded VRUs under adverse conditions is, to the best of our knowledge, novel.</p></details> |  |

Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures Updated with the camera-ready version after acceptance</p></details> |
| **[RealCamo: Boosting Real Camouflage Synthesis with Layout Controls and Textual-Visual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22974v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose RealCamo, a novel out-painting-based framework for controllable realistic camouflaged image generation. RealCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multimodal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, existing methods suffer from two key issues: (1) selecting only the most similar prompt discards complementary cues from other high-quality prompts; and (2) failing to exploit the structured information implied by different prompt arrangements. We propose an end-to-end VICL framework to overcome these limitations. Firstly, an adaptive Fusion Module aggregates critical patterns and annotations from multiple prompts to form more precise contextual prompts. Secondly, we introduce arrangement-specific lightweight MLPs to decouple layout priors from the core model, while minimally affecting the overall model. In addition, an bidirectional fine-tuning mechanism swaps the roles of query and prompt, encouraging the model to reconstruct the original prompt from fused context and thus enhancing collaboration between the fusion module and the inpainting model. Experiments on foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization demonstrate superior results and strong cross-task generalization of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Visual In-Context Learning by Multi-Faceted Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10107v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual In-Context Learning (VICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm, enabling models to perform novel visual tasks by learning from in-context examples. The dominant "retrieve-then-prompt" approach typically relies on selecting the single best visual prompt, a practice that often discards valuable contextual information from other suitable candidates. While recent work has explored fusing the top-K prompts into a single, enhanced representation, this still simply collapses multiple rich signals into one, limiting the model's reasoning capability. We argue that a more multi-faceted, collaborative fusion is required to unlock the full potential of these diverse contexts. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework that moves beyond single-prompt fusion towards an multi-combination collaborative fusion. Instead of collapsing multiple prompts into one, our method generates three contextual representation branches, each formed by integrating information from different combinations of top-quality prompts. These complementary guidance signals are then fed into proposed MULTI-VQGAN architecture, which is designed to jointly interpret and utilize collaborative information from multiple sources. Extensive experiments on diverse tasks, including foreground segmentation, single-object detection, and image colorization, highlight its strong cross-task generalization, effective contextual fusion, and ability to produce more robust and accurate predictions than existing methods.</p></details> |  |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16M QA pairs over 270K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, with near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral). project page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |

The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.</p></details> | 33 pages, 27figures |
| **[DeTracker: Motion-decoupled Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Unstabilized Satellite Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09240v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Reliable Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Efficient Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09078v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOST-3DSG: Lightweight Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Graphs with Semantic Tracking in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02905v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking objects that move within dynamic environments is a core challenge in robotics. Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking. Code and supplementary material are publicly available on the project website at https://lab-rococo-sapienza.github.io/lost-3dsg/.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMTrack: Semantic Multi-Object Tracking with Multi-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06550v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) systems have achieved remarkable precision in localization and association, effectively answering \textit{where} and \textit{who}. However, they often function as autistic observers, capable of tracing geometric paths but blind to the semantic \textit{what} and \textit{why} behind object behaviors. To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception Test 2025: Challenge Summary and a Unified VQA Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06287v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Third Perception Test challenge was organised as a full-day workshop alongside the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025. Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT Scans As Video: Efficient Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Using Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02521v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-MOT: Autoregressive Multi-object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01925v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Decoupling Amplitude and Phase Attention in Frequency Domain for RGB-Event based Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01022v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenEvTracking</p></details> |  |
| **[CropTrack: A Tracking with Re-Identification Framework for Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24838v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |

Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marwan99.github.io/kv_tracker</p></details> |
| **[Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/Robotmurlock/TDLP}{https://github.com/Robotmurlock/TDLP}.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (+4 for references), 8 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |

In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Failure Analysis of Safety Controllers in Autonomous Vehicles Under Object-Based LiDAR Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22244v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR based perception to support safety critical control functions such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Generalizable Hand-Object Tracking from Synthetic Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19583v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a system for learning generalizable hand-object tracking controllers purely from synthetic data, without requiring any human demonstrations. Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Object Tracking and Intent Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06139v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a Bayesian framework for inferring the posterior of the augmented state of a target, incorporating its underlying goal or intent, such as any intermediate waypoints and/or final destination. The methodology is thus for joint tracking and intent recognition. Several latent intent models are proposed here within a virtual leader formulation. They capture the influence of the target's hidden goal on its instantaneous behaviour. In this context, various motion models, including for highly maneuvering objects, are also considered. The a priori unknown target intent (e.g. destination) can dynamically change over time and take any value within the state space (e.g. a location or spatial region). A sequential Monte Carlo (particle filtering) approach is introduced for the simultaneous estimation of the target's (kinematic) state and its intent. Rao-Blackwellisation is employed to enhance the statistical performance of the inference routine. Simulated data and real radar measurements are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (T-AES)</p></details> |

However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing formulations assume an "offline" setting with full video access at query time, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with power and storage-constrained wearable devices. Towards more application-ready episodic memory systems, we introduce Online Visual Query 2D (OVQ2D), a task where models process video streams online, observing each frame only once, and retrieve object localizations using a compact memory instead of full video history. We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.</p></details> | <details><summary>in IE...</summary><p>in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Application of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments.

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

| **[Beyond Proximity: A Keypoint-Trajectory Framework for Classifying Affiliative and Agonistic Social Networks in Dairy Cattle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14998v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> |

Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISAPP 2026</p></details> |

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeafTrackNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Robust Leaf Tracking in Top-Down Plant Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13130v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/shl-shawn/LeafTrackNet.</p></details> |  |

| **[Implicit Neural Representation Facilitates Unified Universal Vision Encoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14256v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models for image representation learning are typically designed for either recognition or generation. Various forms of contrastive learning help models learn to convert images to embeddings that are useful for classification, detection, and segmentation. On the other hand, models can be trained to reconstruct images with pixel-wise, perceptual, and adversarial losses in order to learn a latent space that is useful for image generation. We seek to unify these two directions with a first-of-its-kind model that learns representations which are simultaneously useful for recognition and generation. We train our model as a hyper-network for implicit neural representation, which learns to map images to model weights for fast, accurate reconstruction. We further integrate our INR hyper-network with knowledge distillation to improve its generalization and performance. Beyond the novel training design, the model also learns an unprecedented compressed embedding space with outstanding performance for various visual tasks. The complete model competes with state-of-the-art results for image representation learning, while also enabling generative capabilities with its high-quality tiny embeddings.

| **[DiffusionAgent: Navigating Expert Models for Agentic Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10061v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the accelerating era of human-instructed visual content creation, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative potential. Yet their deployment is constrained by a dual bottleneck: semantic ambiguity in diverse prompts and the narrow specialization of individual models. A single diffusion architecture struggles to maintain optimal performance across heterogeneous prompts, while conventional "parse-then-call" pipelines artificially separate semantic understanding from generative execution. To bridge this gap, we introduce DiffusionAgent, a unified, language-model-driven agent that casts the entire "prompt comprehension-expert routing-image synthesis" loop into a agentic framework. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) a tree-of-thought-powered expert navigator that performs fine-grained semantic parsing and zero-shot matching to the most suitable diffusion model via an extensible prior-knowledge tree; (2) an advantage database updated with human-in-the-loop feedback, continually aligning model-selection policy with human aesthetic and semantic preferences; and (3) a fully decoupled agent architecture that activates the optimal generative path for open-domain prompts without retraining or fine-tuning any expert. Extensive experiments show that DiffusionAgent retains high generation quality while significantly broadening prompt coverage, establishing a new performance and generality benchmark for multi-domain image synthesis.

| **[GalaxyEdit: Large-Scale Image Editing Dataset with Enhanced Diffusion Adapter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13794v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training of large-scale text-to-image and image-to-image models requires a huge amount of annotated data. While text-to-image datasets are abundant, data available for instruction-based image-to-image tasks like object addition and removal is limited. This is because of the several challenges associated with the data generation process, such as, significant human effort, limited automation, suboptimal end-to-end models, data diversity constraints and high expenses. We propose an automated data generation pipeline aimed at alleviating such limitations, and introduce GalaxyEdit - a large-scale image editing dataset for add and remove operations. We fine-tune the SD v1.5 model on our dataset and find that our model can successfully handle a broader range of objects and complex editing instructions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods in FID scores by 11.2\% and 26.1\% for add and remove tasks respectively. Furthermore, in light of on-device usage scenarios, we expand our research to include task-specific lightweight adapters leveraging the ControlNet-xs architecture. While ControlNet-xs excels in canny and depth guided generation, we propose to improve the communication between the control network and U-Net for more intricate add and remove tasks. We achieve this by enhancing ControlNet-xs with non-linear interaction layers based on Volterra filters. Our approach outperforms ControlNet-xs in both add/remove and canny-guided image generation tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of the proposed enhancement.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Paired Image Generation with Diffusion-Guided Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14833v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The segmentation of mass lesions in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) images is very significant for the early screening of breast cancer. However, the high-density breast tissue often leads to high concealment of the mass lesions, which makes manual annotation difficult and time-consuming. As a result, there is a lack of annotated data for model training. Diffusion models are commonly used for data augmentation, but the existing methods face two challenges. First, due to the high concealment of lesions, it is difficult for the model to learn the features of the lesion area. This leads to the low generation quality of the lesion areas, thus limiting the quality of the generated images. Second, existing methods can only generate images and cannot generate corresponding annotations, which restricts the usability of the generated images in supervised training. In this work, we propose a paired image generation method. The method does not require external conditions and can achieve the generation of paired images by training an extra diffusion guider for the conditional diffusion model. During the experimental phase, we generated paired DBT slices and mass lesion masks. Then, we incorporated them into the supervised training process of the mass lesion segmentation task. The experimental results show that our method can improve the generation quality without external conditions. Moreover, it contributes to alleviating the shortage of annotated data, thus enhancing the performance of downstream tasks.

| **[Dynamic Differential Linear Attention: Enhancing Linear Diffusion Transformer for High-Quality Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13683v1)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers (DiTs) have emerged as a powerful architecture for high-fidelity image generation, yet the quadratic cost of self-attention poses a major scalability bottleneck. To address this, linear attention mechanisms have been adopted to reduce computational cost; unfortunately, the resulting linear diffusion transformers (LiTs) models often come at the expense of generative performance, frequently producing over-smoothed attention weights that limit expressiveness. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Differential Linear Attention (DyDiLA), a novel linear attention formulation that enhances the effectiveness of LiTs by mitigating the oversmoothing issue and improving generation quality. Specifically, the novelty of DyDiLA lies in three key designs: (i) dynamic projection module, which facilitates the decoupling of token representations by learning with dynamically assigned knowledge; (ii) dynamic measure kernel, which provides a better similarity measurement to capture fine-grained semantic distinctions between tokens by dynamically assigning kernel functions for token processing; and (iii) token differential operator, which enables more robust query-to-key retrieval by calculating the differences between the tokens and their corresponding information redundancy produced by dynamic measure kernel. To capitalize on DyDiLA, we introduce a refined LiT, termed DyDi-LiT, that systematically incorporates our advancements. Extensive experiments show that DyDi-LiT consistently outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across multiple metrics, underscoring its strong practical potential.</p></details> |  |

Object detectors may miss targets or return multiple plausible detections, and simple geometric tests can become ambiguous in borderline cases. Spatial evaluation is naturally a selective prediction problem, the checker may abstain when evidence is weak and report confidence so that results can be interpreted as a risk coverage tradeoff rather than a single score. We introduce SpatialBench-UC, a small, reproducible benchmark for pairwise spatial relations. The benchmark contains 200 prompts (50 object pairs times 4 relations) grouped into 100 counterfactual pairs obtained by swapping object roles. We release a benchmark package, versioned prompts, pinned configs, per-sample checker outputs, and report tables, enabling reproducible and auditable comparisons across models. We also include a lightweight human audit used to calibrate the checker's abstention margin and confidence threshold. We evaluate three baselines, Stable Diffusion 1.5, SD 1.5 BoxDiff, and SD 1.4 GLIGEN. The checker reports pass rate and coverage as well as conditional pass rates on decided samples. The results show that grounding methods substantially improve both pass rate and coverage, while abstention remains a dominant factor due mainly to missing detections.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, includes figures and tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond the Safety Tax: Mitigating Unsafe Text-to-Image Generation via External Safety Rectification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21099v3)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generative models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, yet remain vulnerable to generating unsafe content. Existing safety defenses typically intervene internally within the generative model, but suffer from severe concept entanglement, leading to degradation of benign generation quality, a trade-off we term the Safety Tax. To overcome this limitation, we advocate a paradigm shift from destructive internal editing to external safety rectification. Following this principle, we propose SafePatch, a structurally isolated safety module that performs external, interpretable rectification without modifying the base model. The core backbone of SafePatch is architecturally instantiated as a trainable clone of the base model's encoder, allowing it to inherit rich semantic priors and maintain representation consistency. To enable interpretable safety rectification, we construct a strictly aligned counterfactual safety dataset (ACS) for differential supervision training. Across nudity and multi-category benchmarks and recent adversarial prompt attacks, SafePatch achieves robust unsafe suppression (7% unsafe on I2P) while preserving image quality and semantic alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[InstructMoLE: Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-rank Experts for Multi-Conditional Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21788v2)** | 2026-01-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) for diverse, multi-conditional tasks often suffers from task interference when using monolithic adapters like LoRA. The Mixture of Low-rank Experts (MoLE) architecture offers a modular solution, but its potential is usually limited by routing policies that operate at a token level. Such local routing can conflict with the global nature of user instructions, leading to artifacts like spatial fragmentation and semantic drift in complex image generation tasks. To address these limitations, we introduce InstructMoLE, a novel framework that employs an Instruction-Guided Mixture of Low-Rank Experts. Instead of per-token routing, InstructMoLE utilizes a global routing signal, Instruction-Guided Routing (IGR), derived from the user's comprehensive instruction. This ensures that a single, coherently chosen expert council is applied uniformly across all input tokens, preserving the global semantics and structural integrity of the generation process. To complement this, we introduce an output-space orthogonality loss, which promotes expert functional diversity and mitigates representational collapse. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InstructMoLE significantly outperforms existing LoRA adapters and MoLE variants across challenging multi-conditional generation benchmarks. Our work presents a robust and generalizable framework for instruction-driven fine-tuning of generative models, enabling superior compositional control and fidelity to user intent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Dirac Delta: Mitigating Diversity Collapse in Reinforcement Fine-Tuning for Versatile Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12401v1)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for fine-tuning large-scale generative models, such as diffusion and flow models, to align with complex human preferences and user-specified tasks. A fundamental limitation remains \textit{the curse of diversity collapse}, where the objective formulation and optimization landscape inherently collapse the policy to a Dirac delta distribution. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{DRIFT} (\textbf{D}ive\textbf{R}sity-\textbf{I}ncentivized Reinforcement \textbf{F}ine-\textbf{T}uning for Versatile Image Generation), an innovative framework that systematically incentivizes output diversity throughout the on-policy fine-tuning process, reconciling strong task alignment with high generation diversity to enhance versatility essential for applications that demand diverse candidate generations. We approach the problem across three representative perspectives: i) \textbf{sampling} a reward-concentrated subset that filters out reward outliers to prevent premature collapse; ii) \textbf{prompting} with stochastic variations to expand the conditioning space, and iii) \textbf{optimization} of the intra-group diversity with a potential-based reward shaping mechanism. Experimental results show that DRIFT achieves superior Pareto dominance regarding task alignment and generation diversity, yielding a $ 9.08\%\!\sim\! 43.46\%$ increase in diversity at equivalent alignment levels and a $ 59.65\% \!\sim\! 65.86\%$ increase in alignment at equivalent levels of diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wukong Framework for Not Safe For Work Detection in Text-to-Image systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00591v2)** | 2026-01-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Image (T2I) generation is a popular AI-generated content (AIGC) technology enabling diverse and creative image synthesis. However, some outputs may contain Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content (e.g., violence), violating community guidelines. Detecting NSFW content efficiently and accurately, known as external safeguarding, is essential. Existing external safeguards fall into two types: text filters, which analyze user prompts but overlook T2I model-specific variations and are prone to adversarial attacks; and image filters, which analyze final generated images but are computationally costly and introduce latency. Diffusion models, the foundation of modern T2I systems like Stable Diffusion, generate images through iterative denoising using a U-Net architecture with ResNet and Transformer blocks. We observe that: (1) early denoising steps define the semantic layout of the image, and (2) cross-attention layers in U-Net are crucial for aligning text and image regions. Based on these insights, we propose Wukong, a transformer-based NSFW detection framework that leverages intermediate outputs from early denoising steps and reuses U-Net's pre-trained cross-attention parameters. Wukong operates within the diffusion process, enabling early detection without waiting for full image generation. We also introduce a new dataset containing prompts, seeds, and image-specific NSFW labels, and evaluate Wukong on this and two public benchmarks. Results show that Wukong significantly outperforms text-based safeguards and achieves comparable accuracy of image filters, while offering much greater efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD'26 (round 1)</p></details> |

However, PDMs are susceptible to minor adversarial perturbations, leading to significant degradation when fine-tuned on corrupted datasets. These vulnerabilities are exploited to create protective perturbations that prevent unauthorized image generation. Existing purification methods attempt to red-team the protective perturbation to break the protection but often over-purify images, resulting in information loss. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fine-tuning process of PDMs through the lens of shortcut learning. We hypothesize and empirically demonstrate that adversarial perturbations induce a latent-space misalignment between images and their text prompts in the CLIP embedding space. This misalignment causes the model to erroneously associate noisy patterns with unique identifiers during fine-tuning, resulting in poor generalization. Based on these insights, we propose a systematic red-teaming framework that includes data purification and contrastive decoupling learning. We first employ off-the-shelf image restoration techniques to realign images with their original semantic content in latent space. Then, we introduce contrastive decoupling learning with noise tokens to decouple the learning of personalized concepts from spurious noise patterns. Our study not only uncovers shortcut learning vulnerabilities in PDMs but also provides a thorough evaluation framework for developing stronger protection. Our extensive evaluation demonstrates its advantages over existing purification methods and its robustness against adaptive perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available at https://github.com/liuyixin-louis/DiffShortcut</p></details> |
| **[Transport Based Mean Flows for Generative Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22592v2)** | 2026-01-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-matching generative models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for continuous data generation, achieving state-of-the-art results across domains such as images, 3D shapes, and point clouds. Despite their success, these models suffer from slow inference due to the requirement of numerous sequential sampling steps. Recent work has sought to accelerate inference by reducing the number of sampling steps. In particular, Mean Flows offer a one-step generation approach that delivers substantial speedups while retaining strong generative performance. Yet, in many continuous domains, Mean Flows fail to faithfully approximate the behavior of the original multi-step flow-matching process. In this work, we address this limitation by incorporating optimal transport-based sampling strategies into the Mean Flow framework, enabling one-step generators that better preserve the fidelity and diversity of the original multi-step flow process. Experiments on controlled low-dimensional settings and on high-dimensional tasks such as image generation, image-to-image translation, and point cloud generation demonstrate that our approach achieves superior inference accuracy in one-step generative modeling.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities -- such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Typically operating in a black-box manner, it employs an encoder-decoder framework for watermark embedding and extraction. While existing research has focused primarily on the encoders for the robustness to resist various attacks, the decoders have been largely overlooked, leading to attacks against the watermark. In this paper, we identify one such attack against the decoder, where query responses are utilized to obtain backpropagated gradients to train a watermark remover. To address this issue, we propose Decoder Gradient Shields (DGSs), a family of defense mechanisms, including DGS at the output (DGS-O), at the input (DGS-I), and in the layers (DGS-L) of the decoder, with a closed-form solution for DGS-O and provable performance for all DGS. Leveraging the joint design of reorienting and rescaling of the gradients from watermark channel gradient leaking queries, the proposed DGSs effectively prevent the watermark remover from achieving training convergence to the desired low-loss value, while preserving image quality of the decoder output. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DGSs in diverse application scenarios. Our experimental results on deraining and image generation tasks with the state-of-the-art box-free watermarking show that our DGSs achieve a defense success rate of 100% under all settings.</p></details> |  |

Meanwhile, visual autoregressive models (VARs) have recently shown impressive image generation capability, but their adoption for pixel-level discriminative tasks remains limited due to weak controllability, suboptimal dense prediction performance and exposure bias. We introduce RemoteVAR, a new VAR-based change detection framework that addresses these limitations by conditioning autoregressive prediction on multi-resolution fused bi-temporal features via cross-attention, and by employing an autoregressive training strategy designed specifically for change map prediction. Extensive experiments on standard change detection benchmarks show that RemoteVAR delivers consistent and significant improvements over strong diffusion-based and transformer-based baselines, establishing a competitive autoregressive alternative for remote sensing change detection. Code will be available \href{https://github.com/yilmazkorkmaz1/RemoteVAR}{\underline{here}}.</p></details> |  |

We frame calibration as a constrained optimization problem and seek the closest model in Kullback-Leibler divergence satisfying calibration constraints. To address the intractability of imposing these constraints exactly, we introduce two surrogate objectives for fine-tuning: (1) the relax loss, which replaces the constraint with a miscalibration penalty, and (2) the reward loss, which converts calibration into a reward fine-tuning problem. We demonstrate that these approaches substantially reduce calibration error across hundreds of simultaneous constraints and models with up to one billion parameters, spanning applications in protein design, image generation, and language modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our codebase accompanying the paper is available at: https://github.com/smithhenryd/cgm</p></details> |
| **[Nixie: Efficient, Transparent Temporal Multiplexing for Consumer GPUs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11743v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consumer machines are increasingly running large ML workloads such as large language models (LLMs), text-to-image generation, and interactive image editing. Unlike datacenter GPUs, consumer GPUs serve single-user, rapidly changing workloads, and each model's working set often nearly fills the GPU memory. As a result, existing sharing mechanisms (e.g., NVIDIA Unified Virtual Memory) perform poorly due to memory thrashing and excessive use of CPU pinned memory when multiple applications are active. We design and implement Nixie, a system that enables efficient and transparent temporal multiplexing on consumer GPUs without requiring any application or driver changes. Nixie is a system service that coordinates GPU memory allocation and kernel launch behavior to efficiently utilize the CPU-GPU bi-directional bandwidth and CPU pinned memory. A lightweight scheduler in Nixie further improves responsiveness by automatically prioritizing latency-sensitive interactive jobs using MLFQ-inspired techniques. Our evaluations show that Nixie improves latency of real interactive code-completion tasks by up to $3.8\times$ and saves up to 66.8% CPU pinned memory usage given the same latency requirement.</p></details> |  |
| **[CulturalFrames: Assessing Cultural Expectation Alignment in Text-to-Image Models and Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08835v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing ubiquity of text-to-image (T2I) models as tools for visual content generation raises concerns about their ability to accurately represent diverse cultural contexts -- where missed cues can stereotype communities and undermine usability. In this work, we present the first study to systematically quantify the alignment of T2I models and evaluation metrics with respect to both explicit (stated) as well as implicit (unstated, implied by the prompt's cultural context) cultural expectations. To this end, we introduce CulturalFrames, a novel benchmark designed for rigorous human evaluation of cultural representation in visual generations. Spanning 10 countries and 5 socio-cultural domains, CulturalFrames comprises 983 prompts, 3637 corresponding images generated by 4 state-of-the-art T2I models, and over 10k detailed human annotations. We find that across models and countries, cultural expectations are missed an average of 44% of the time. Among these failures, explicit expectations are missed at a surprisingly high average rate of 68%, while implicit expectation failures are also significant, averaging 49%. Furthermore, we show that existing T2I evaluation metrics correlate poorly with human judgments of cultural alignment, irrespective of their internal reasoning. Collectively, our findings expose critical gaps, provide a concrete testbed, and outline actionable directions for developing culturally informed T2I models and metrics that improve global usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Generative AI Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Domain Environments under Data Sharing constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12979v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning has gained attention for its ability to enable multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables utilizing distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experiments show that our approach demonstrates significant improvements across key metrics, where it achieves an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 60% in multi-domain non-IID settings), 1.1x -- 3x higher image generation scores for the MNIST family datasets, and 2x -- 70x lower FID scores for higher resolution datasets.

In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of six frontier models--GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5--assessing each across language, vision-language, and image generation using a unified protocol that combines benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations. By aggregating results into safety leaderboards and model profiles, we reveal a highly uneven safety landscape: while GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced performance, other models exhibit clear trade-offs across benchmark safety, adversarial robustness, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Despite strong results under standard benchmarks, all models remain highly vulnerable under adversarial testing, with worst-case safety rates dropping below 6%. Text-to-image models show slightly stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain fragile when faced with adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these findings highlight that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation design--underscoring the need for standardized, holistic safety assessments to better reflect real-world risk and guide responsible deployment.</p></details> | 41 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Generation of Chest CT pulmonary Nodule Images by Latent Diffusion Models using the LIDC-IDRI Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11085v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, computer-aided diagnosis systems have been developed to support diagnosis, but their performance depends heavily on the quality and quantity of training data. However, in clinical practice, it is difficult to collect the large amount of CT images for specific cases, such as small cell carcinoma with low epidemiological incidence or benign tumors that are difficult to distinguish from malignant ones. This leads to the challenge of data imbalance. In this study, to address this issue, we proposed a method to automatically generate chest CT nodule images that capture target features using latent diffusion models (LDM) and verified its effectiveness. Using the LIDC-IDRI dataset, we created pairs of nodule images and finding-based text prompts based on physician evaluations. For the image generation models, we used Stable Diffusion version 1.5 (SDv1) and 2.0 (SDv2), which are types of LDM. Each model was fine-tuned using the created dataset. During the generation process, we adjusted the guidance scale (GS), which indicates the fidelity to the input text. Both quantitative and subjective evaluations showed that SDv2 (GS = 5) achieved the best performance in terms of image quality, diversity, and text consistency. In the subjective evaluation, no statistically significant differences were observed between the generated images and real images, confirming that the quality was equivalent to real clinical images. We proposed a method for generating chest CT nodule images based on input text using LDM. Evaluation results demonstrated that the proposed method could generate high-quality images that successfully capture specific medical features.</p></details> |  |
| **[TetriServe: Efficient DiT Serving for Heterogeneous Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01565v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating high-quality images through iterative denoising steps, but serving them under strict Service Level Objectives (SLOs) is challenging due to their high computational cost, particularly at large resolutions. Existing serving systems use fixed degree sequence parallelism, which is inefficient for heterogeneous workloads with mixed resolutions and deadlines, leading to poor GPU utilization and low SLO attainment. In this paper, we propose step-level sequence parallelism to dynamically adjust the degree of parallelism of individual requests according to their deadlines. We present TetriServe, a DiT serving system that implements this strategy for highly efficient image generation. Specifically, TetriServe introduces a novel round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2) adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and (3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation on state-of-the-art DiT models shows that TetriServe achieves up to 32% higher SLO attainment compared to existing solutions without degrading image quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Aesthetics as Structural Harm: Algorithmic Lookism Across Text-to-Image Generation and Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11651v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines algorithmic lookism-the systematic preferential treatment based on physical appearance-in text-to-image (T2I) generative AI and a downstream gender classification task. Through the analysis of 26,400 synthetic faces created with Stable Diffusion 2.1 and 3.5 Medium, we demonstrate how generative AI models systematically associate facial attractiveness with positive attributes and vice-versa, mirroring socially constructed biases rather than evidence-based correlations. Furthermore, we find significant gender bias in three gender classification algorithms depending on the attributes of the input faces. Our findings reveal three critical harms: (1) the systematic encoding of attractiveness-positive attribute associations in T2I models; (2) gender disparities in classification systems, where women's faces, particularly those generated with negative attributes, suffer substantially higher misclassification rates than men's; and (3) intensifying aesthetic constraints in newer models through age homogenization, gendered exposure patterns, and geographic reductionism. These convergent patterns reveal algorithmic lookism as systematic infrastructure operating across AI vision systems, compounding existing inequalities through both representation and recognition. Disclaimer: This work includes visual and textual content that reflects stereotypical associations between physical appearance and socially constructed attributes, including gender, race, and traits associated with social desirability. Any such associations found in this study emerge from the biases embedded in generative AI systems-not from empirical truths or the authors' views.</p></details> | 22 pages, 15 figures |
| **[Think-Then-Generate: Reasoning-Aware Text-to-Image Diffusion with LLM Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10332v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models (DMs) has enabled high-quality visual synthesis from diverse textual prompts. Yet, most existing T2I DMs, even those equipped with large language model (LLM)-based text encoders, remain text-pixel mappers -- they employ LLMs merely as text encoders, without leveraging their inherent reasoning capabilities to infer what should be visually depicted given the textual prompt. To move beyond such literal generation, we propose the think-then-generate (T2G) paradigm, where the LLM-based text encoder is encouraged to reason about and rewrite raw user prompts; the states of the rewritten prompts then serve as diffusion conditioning. To achieve this, we first activate the think-then-rewrite pattern of the LLM encoder with a lightweight supervised fine-tuning process. Subsequently, the LLM encoder and diffusion backbone are co-optimized to ensure faithful reasoning about the context and accurate rendering of the semantics via Dual-GRPO. In particular, the text encoder is reinforced using image-grounded rewards to infer and recall world knowledge, while the diffusion backbone is pushed to produce semantically consistent and visually coherent images. Experiments show substantial improvements in factual consistency, semantic alignment, and visual realism across reasoning-based image generation and editing benchmarks, achieving 0.79 on WISE score, nearly on par with GPT-4. Our results constitute a promising step toward next-generation unified models with reasoning, expression, and demonstration capacities.</p></details> |  |
| **[RealCamo: Boosting Real Camouflage Synthesis with Layout Controls and Textual-Visual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22974v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose RealCamo, a novel out-painting-based framework for controllable realistic camouflaged image generation. RealCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multimodal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Fine-Tuning Diffusion Models via Intermediate Distribution Shaping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02692v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models are widely used for generative tasks across domains. While pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs KL regularized reward maximization with reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule generation and unconditional image generation. Notably, our framework, applied to Stable Diffusion 2, improves over policy gradient methods on popular T2I benchmarks in terms of VQAScore and shows an $8.81\%$ relative improvement over the base model. For unconditional image generation, inverse noise correction improves FID of generated images at lower FLOPs/image.</p></details> |  |

Existing solutions rely heavily on machine translation, while advances in multilingual text modeling remain underutilized. We introduce METAL, a lightweight alignment method that learns only a few linear layers using English text alone to map multilingual text embeddings into a multimodal space. Despite its simplicity, METAL matches baseline performance in English (94.9 percent Recall at 10) and achieves strong zero-shot transfer (89.5 percent Recall at 10 averaged across 11 languages, 10 unseen) on XTD text-to-image retrieval. Qualitative t-SNE visualizations show that multilingual embeddings align tightly with multimodal representations, while weight analysis reveals that the transformation reshapes embedding geometry rather than performing trivial rotations. Beyond image-text retrieval, METAL generalizes to audio-text retrieval and cross-lingual text-to-image generation. We release code and checkpoints at https://github.com/m2m-codebase/M2M , as well as multilingual evaluation datasets including MSCOCO Multilingual 30K (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/mscoco-multilingual-30k ), AudioCaps Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/audiocaps-multilingual ), and Clotho Multilingual (https://huggingface.co/datasets/piyushsinghpasi/clotho-multilingual ), to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>EACL ...</summary><p>EACL 2026 Findings accepted.

With this capability, video models have been successfully applied to various visual tasks (e.g., maze solving, visual puzzles). However, their potential to enhance text-to-image (T2I) generation remains largely unexplored due to the absence of a clearly defined visual reasoning starting point and interpretable intermediate states in the T2I generation process. To bridge this gap, we propose CoF-T2I, a model that integrates CoF reasoning into T2I generation via progressive visual refinement, where intermediate frames act as explicit reasoning steps and the final frame is taken as output. To establish such an explicit generation process, we curate CoF-Evol-Instruct, a dataset of CoF trajectories that model the generation process from semantics to aesthetics. To further improve quality and avoid motion artifacts, we enable independent encoding operation for each frame. Experiments show that CoF-T2I significantly outperforms the base video model and achieves competitive performance on challenging benchmarks, reaching 0.86 on GenEval and 7.468 on Imagine-Bench. These results indicate the substantial promise of video models for advancing high-quality text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[How Many Human Judgments Are Enough? Feasibility Limits of Human Preference Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09084v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human preference evaluations are widely used to compare generative models, yet it remains unclear how many judgments are required to reliably detect small improvements. We show that when preference signal is diffuse across prompts (i.e., all prompt types are similarly informative), proportional allocation is minimax-optimal: no allocation strategy substantially improves detectability. Empirical analysis of large-scale human preference datasets shows that most comparisons fall into this diffuse regime, exhibiting small preference margins that require far more judgments than typically collected, even in well-sampled comparisons. These limits persist across evaluation protocols and modalities, including chat, image generation, and code generation with execution feedback. In contrast, curated benchmarks that reduce prompt induced variability systematically induce larger margins and improve detectability through a $1.5\times$ reduction in prompt-level variance. Our results show that inconclusive or negative human evaluation outcomes frequently reflect underpowered evaluation rather than model equivalence, underscoring the need to account explicitly for effect size, budget, and protocol design.</p></details> |  |
