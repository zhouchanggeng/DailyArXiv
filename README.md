| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Performance Analysis of NOMA-Assisted Optical OFDM ISAC Systems with Clipping Distortion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02282v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the performance of optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). Due to their inherent high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), OFDM waveforms are clipped to fit the limited dynamic range of the optical transmitters (e.g., light-emitting diodes (LEDs)), resulting in clipping distortion. To alleviate the impact of the distortion, we propose a novel transmitter architecture where the clipping processes are performed before NOMA superposition coding. We then analyze the performance of the proposed optical ISAC systems considering the effects of power allocation and clipping distortion. For the communication subsystem, we analyze the effect of NOMA on the achievable sum rate and bit error rate (BER). For the sensing subsystem, the root mean square error (RMSE) and Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) of estimating the transmission distance accuracy are obtained. Simulation results reveal that allocating more power to the strong user yields a higher sum rate, lower BER, and better sensing performance, whereas a more balanced power allocation among users results in degraded BER and sensing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bayesian Natural Gradient Fine-Tuning of CLIP Models via Kalman Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01694v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, have established new benchmarks in multimodal data mining. In such models, few-shot fine-tuning is a major challenge to achieve optimal performance on both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, especially when labeled data is scarce. Most existing fine-tuning approaches rely on first-order gradient-based optimizers, which typically suffer from slow convergence, sensitivity to step-size hyperparameters, and poor generalization in OOD settings. In contrast, second-order methods utilize local curvature information of the loss landscape to adjust the update step size. This is particularly beneficial for CLIP models, whose non-convex loss functions often contain sharp critical points. In such cases, natural gradient direction can offer more substantial and efficient per-iteration updates when fine-tuning with limited data. Natural Gradient Descent (NGD) is obtained by preconditioning the standard gradient with the inverse Fisher Information Matrix (FIM), which is computationally expensive for large models. To address this, we propose a Bayesian approximation of NGD using a Kalman filter for CLIP models. Our method combines the benefits of second-order optimization with Bayesian inference, which enhances generalization while providing uncertainty quantification. Extensive experiments conducted on diverse image classification datasets demonstrate that our algorithm consistently achieves superior--or comparable--ID performance and improved OOD robustness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful application of Kalman filtering to fine-tuning CLIP-based models, which enables more robust and efficient learning in vision-language tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SegDebias: Test-Time Bias Mitigation for ViT-Based CLIP via Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00523v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision language models such as CLIP have shown remarkable performance in zero shot classification, but remain susceptible to spurious correlations, where irrelevant visual features influence predictions. Existing debiasing methods often require access to training data and explicit group labels to perform fine-tuning or adjust embeddings, which limits their practicality in real-world settings. Test-time methods attempt to avoid this constraint, but many still depend on prior knowledge of dataset specific biases, limiting their generalizability in open set settings. In this work, we propose a test-time debiasing method for ViT based CLIP models that requires no additional training or assumptions of bias annotations. Our approach uses a pretrained segmentation model to isolate the target visual attribute, then adjusts the non target regions so that their embeddings are uniformly similar to all class specific text prompts. This procedure removes unintended bias signals from confounding visual regions while preserving the target attribute. Experiments on Waterbirds and CelebA show that our method outperforms existing test-time debiasing approaches in both group robustness metrics and Attention IoU. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of segmentation guided interventions for scalable and annotation free bias mitigation in vision language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToxicTextCLIP: Text-Based Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks on CLIP Pre-training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00446v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has significantly advanced vision-language modeling by aligning image-text pairs from large-scale web data through self-supervised contrastive learning. Yet, its reliance on uncurated Internet-sourced data exposes it to data poisoning and backdoor risks. While existing studies primarily investigate image-based attacks, the text modality, which is equally central to CLIP's training, remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce ToxicTextCLIP, a framework for generating high-quality adversarial texts that target CLIP during the pre-training phase. The framework addresses two key challenges: semantic misalignment caused by background inconsistency with the target class, and the scarcity of background-consistent texts. To this end, ToxicTextCLIP iteratively applies: 1) a background-aware selector that prioritizes texts with background content aligned to the target class, and 2) a background-driven augmenter that generates semantically coherent and diverse poisoned samples. Extensive experiments on classification and retrieval tasks show that ToxicTextCLIP achieves up to 95.83% poisoning success and 98.68% backdoor Hit@1, while bypassing RoCLIP, CleanCLIP and SafeCLIP defenses.

| **[AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 32nd International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling</p></details> |
| **[GRPO-Guard: Mitigating Implicit Over-Optimization in Flow Matching via Regulated Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22319v2)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, GRPO-based reinforcement learning has shown remarkable progress in optimizing flow-matching models, effectively improving their alignment with task-specific rewards. Within these frameworks, the policy update relies on importance-ratio clipping to constrain overconfident positive and negative gradients. However, in practice, we observe a systematic shift in the importance-ratio distribution-its mean falls below 1 and its variance differs substantially across timesteps. This left-shifted and inconsistent distribution prevents positive-advantage samples from entering the clipped region, causing the mechanism to fail in constraining overconfident positive updates. As a result, the policy model inevitably enters an implicit over-optimization stage-while the proxy reward continues to increase, essential metrics such as image quality and text-prompt alignment deteriorate sharply, ultimately making the learned policy impractical for real-world use. To address this issue, we introduce GRPO-Guard, a simple yet effective enhancement to existing GRPO frameworks. Our method incorporates ratio normalization, which restores a balanced and step-consistent importance ratio, ensuring that PPO clipping properly constrains harmful updates across denoising timesteps. In addition, a gradient reweighting strategy equalizes policy gradients over noise conditions, preventing excessive updates from particular timestep regions. Together, these designs act as a regulated clipping mechanism, stabilizing optimization and substantially mitigating implicit over-optimization without relying on heavy KL regularization. Extensive experiments on multiple diffusion backbones (e.g., SD3.5M, Flux.1-dev) and diverse proxy tasks demonstrate that GRPO-Guard significantly reduces over-optimization while maintaining or even improving generation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://jingw193.github.io/GRPO-Guard/</p></details> |
| **[Adapter-state Sharing CLIP for Parameter-efficient Multimodal Sarcasm Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04508v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing prevalence of multimodal image-text sarcasm on social media poses challenges for opinion mining systems. Existing approaches rely on full fine-tuning of large models, making them unsuitable to adapt under resource-constrained settings. While recent parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods offer promise, their off-the-shelf use underperforms on complex tasks like sarcasm detection. We propose AdS-CLIP (Adapter-state Sharing in CLIP), a lightweight framework built on CLIP that inserts adapters only in the upper layers to preserve low-level unimodal representations in the lower layers and introduces a novel adapter-state sharing mechanism, where textual adapters guide visual ones to promote efficient cross-modal learning in the upper layers. Experiments on two public benchmarks demonstrate that AdS-CLIP not only outperforms standard PEFT methods but also existing multimodal baselines with significantly fewer trainable parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Caption-Driven Explainability: Probing CNNs for Bias via CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22035v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness has become one of the most critical problems in machine learning (ML). The science of interpreting ML models to understand their behavior and improve their robustness is referred to as explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). One of the state-of-the-art XAI methods for computer vision problems is to generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights the pixel space of an image that excites the ML model the most. However, this property could be misleading if spurious and salient features are present in overlapping pixel spaces. In this paper, we propose a caption-based XAI method, which integrates a standalone model to be explained into the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model using a novel network surgery approach. The resulting caption-based XAI model identifies the dominant concept that contributes the most to the models prediction. This explanation minimizes the risk of the standalone model falling for a covariate shift and contributes significantly towards developing robust ML models.

| **[SAGE: Structure-Aware Generative Video Transitions between Diverse Clips](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24667v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips, but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques (cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows, distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code to be released on acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://kan32501.github.io/sage.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Compositional Awareness in CLIP with Efficient Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24424v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot capabilities in classification and retrieval. However, these models often struggle with compositional reasoning - the ability to understand the relationships between concepts. A recent benchmark, SugarCrepe++, reveals that previous works on improving compositionality have mainly improved lexical sensitivity but neglected semantic understanding. In addition, downstream retrieval performance often deteriorates, although one would expect that improving compositionality should enhance retrieval. In this work, we introduce CLIC (Compositionally-aware Learning in CLIP), a fine-tuning method based on a novel training technique combining multiple images and their associated captions. CLIC improves compositionality across architectures as well as differently pre-trained CLIP models, both in terms of lexical and semantic understanding, and achieves consistent gains in retrieval performance. This even applies to the recent CLIPS, which achieves SOTA retrieval performance. Nevertheless, the short fine-tuning with CLIC leads to an improvement in retrieval and to the best compositional CLIP model on SugarCrepe++. All our models and code are available at https://clic-compositional-clip.github.io</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot Remote Sensing Image Scene Classification with CLIP and Prompt Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24321v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Does CLIP perceive art the same way we do?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05229v2)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP has emerged as a powerful multimodal model capable of connecting images and text through joint embeddings, but to what extent does it 'see' the same way humans do - especially when interpreting artworks? In this paper, we investigate CLIP's ability to extract high-level semantic and stylistic information from paintings, including both human-created and AI-generated imagery. We evaluate its perception across multiple dimensions: content, scene understanding, artistic style, historical period, and the presence of visual deformations or artifacts. By designing targeted probing tasks and comparing CLIP's responses to human annotations and expert benchmarks, we explore its alignment with human perceptual and contextual understanding. Our findings reveal both strengths and limitations in CLIP's visual representations, particularly in relation to aesthetic cues and artistic intent. We further discuss the implications of these insights for using CLIP as a guidance mechanism during generative processes, such as style transfer or prompt-based image synthesis. Our work highlights the need for deeper interpretability in multimodal systems, especially when applied to creative domains where nuance and subjectivity play a central role.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing CLIP Robustness via Cross-Modality Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24038v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features, which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other. This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations, leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14 zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA, especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers, leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14), partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and practicality for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |
| **[GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, under peer review</p></details> |
| **[A Training-Free Framework for Open-Vocabulary Image Segmentation and Recognition with EfficientNet and CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19333v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel training-free framework for open-vocabulary image segmentation and object recognition (OVSR), which leverages EfficientNetB0, a convolutional neural network, for unsupervised segmentation and CLIP, a vision-language model, for open-vocabulary object recognition. The proposed framework adopts a two stage pipeline: unsupervised image segmentation followed by segment-level recognition via vision-language alignment. In the first stage, pixel-wise features extracted from EfficientNetB0 are decomposed using singular value decomposition to obtain latent representations, which are then clustered using hierarchical clustering to segment semantically meaningful regions. The number of clusters is adaptively determined by the distribution of singular values. In the second stage, the segmented regions are localized and encoded into image embeddings using the Vision Transformer backbone of CLIP. Text embeddings are precomputed using CLIP's text encoder from category-specific prompts, including a generic something else prompt to support open set recognition. The image and text embeddings are concatenated and projected into a shared latent feature space via SVD to enhance cross-modal alignment. Recognition is performed by computing the softmax over the similarities between the projected image and text embeddings. The proposed method is evaluated on standard benchmarks, including COCO, ADE20K, and PASCAL VOC, achieving state-of-the-art performance in terms of Hungarian mIoU, precision, recall, and F1-score. These results demonstrate the effectiveness, flexibility, and generalizability of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[VITRIX-CLIPIN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[BrainMCLIP: Brain Image Decoding with Multi-Layer feature Fusion of CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19332v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoding images from fMRI often involves mapping brain activity to CLIP's final semantic layer. To capture finer visual details, many approaches add a parameter-intensive VAE-based pipeline. However, these approaches overlook rich object information within CLIP's intermediate layers and contradicts the brain's functionally hierarchical. We introduce BrainMCLIP, which pioneers a parameter-efficient, multi-layer fusion approach guided by human visual system's functional hierarchy, eliminating the need for such a separate VAE pathway. BrainMCLIP aligns fMRI signals from functionally distinct visual areas (low-/high-level) to corresponding intermediate and final CLIP layers, respecting functional hierarchy. We further introduce a Cross-Reconstruction strategy and a novel multi-granularity loss. Results show BrainMCLIP achieves highly competitive performance, particularly excelling on high-level semantic metrics where it matches or surpasses SOTA(state-of-the-art) methods, including those using VAE pipelines. Crucially, it achieves this with substantially fewer parameters, demonstrating a reduction of 71.7\%(Table.\ref{tab:compare_clip_vae}) compared to top VAE-based SOTA methods, by avoiding the VAE pathway. By leveraging intermediate CLIP features, it effectively captures visual details often missed by CLIP-only approaches, striking a compelling balance between semantic accuracy and detail fidelity without requiring a separate VAE pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[BAPO: Stabilizing Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning for LLMs via Balanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18927v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the core paradigm for aligning and strengthening large language models (LLMs). Yet, applying RL in off-policy settings--where stale data from past policies are used for training--improves sample efficiency, but remains challenging: policy entropy declines sharply, optimization often becomes unstable and may even collapse. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we identify two key insights: (i) an imbalance in optimization, where negative-advantage samples dominate the policy gradient, suppressing useful behaviors and risking gradient explosions; and (ii) the derived Entropy-Clip Rule, which reveals that the fixed clipping mechanism in PPO-like objectives systematically blocks entropy-increasing updates, thereby driving the policy toward over-exploitation at the expense of exploration. Building on these insights, we propose BAlanced Policy Optimization with Adaptive Clipping (BAPO), a simple yet effective method that dynamically adjusts clipping bounds to adaptively re-balance positive and negative contributions, preserve entropy, and stabilize RL optimization. Across diverse off-policy scenarios--including sample replay and partial rollout--BAPO achieves fast, stable, and data-efficient training. On AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 benchmarks, our 7B BAPO model surpasses open-source counterparts such as SkyWork-OR1-7B, while our 32B BAPO model not only achieves state-of-the-art results among models of the same scale but also outperforms leading proprietary systems like o3-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Thinking.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP Adapter for Domain Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21808v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing approaches.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Frame-Difference Guided Dynamic Region Perception for CLIP Adaptation in Text-Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21806v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13% to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Compositional Reasoning in CLIP via Reconstruction and Alignment of Text Descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16540v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 (poster).

QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls.

| **[Theoretical Refinement of CLIP by Utilizing Linear Structure of Optimal Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15508v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information (PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI. We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across several retrieval and classification tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[FG-CLIP 2: A Bilingual Fine-grained Vision-Language Alignment Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10921v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Learning with Unpaired Clips for Instruction-based Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14648v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-GPPO: Coordinating Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |

While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shrinking the Variance: Shrinkage Baselines for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03710v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline), reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator. Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy -- particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article was accepted by 2025 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design (ICCAD 2025) and was presented in Munich, October 2025</p></details> |
| **[Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning: A Unifying Framework for Offline-to-Online RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03695v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables training from fixed data without online interaction, but policies learned offline often struggle when deployed in dynamic environments due to distributional shift and unreliable value estimates on unseen state-action pairs. We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that (i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.</p></details> |  |

This study presents an integrated 4D/5D digital-twin framework that couples Building Information Modeling (BIM) with natural-language processing (NLP)-based cost mapping, computer-vision (CV)-driven progress measurement, Bayesian probabilistic CPM updating, and deep-reinforcement-learning (DRL) resource-leveling. A nine-month case implementation on a Dallas-Fort Worth mid-rise project demonstrated measurable gains in accuracy and efficiency: 43% reduction in estimating labor, 6% reduction in overtime, and 30% project-buffer utilization, while maintaining an on-time finish at 128 days within P50-P80 confidence bounds. The digital-twin sandbox also enabled real-time "what-if" forecasting and traceable cost-schedule alignment through a 5D knowledge graph. Findings confirm that integrating AI-based analytics with probabilistic CPM and DRL enhances forecasting precision, transparency, and control resilience. The validated workflow establishes a practical pathway toward predictive, adaptive, and auditable construction management.</p></details> |  |

While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise in training policies for specific autonomous robots, existing frameworks and benchmarks are often constrained to unique platforms, limiting generalization and fair comparisons across different mobility systems. In this paper, we present a multi-domain framework for training, evaluating and deploying RL-based navigation policies across diverse robotic platforms and operational environments. Our work presents four key contributions: (1) a scalable and modular framework, facilitating seamless robot-task interchangeability and reproducible training pipelines; (2) sim-to-real transfer demonstrated through real-world experiments with multiple robots, including a satellite robotic simulator, an unmanned surface vessel, and a wheeled ground vehicle; (3) the release of the first open-source API for deploying Isaac Lab-trained policies to real robots, enabling lightweight inference and rapid field validation; and (4) uniform tasks and metrics for cross-medium evaluation, through a unified evaluation testbed to assess performance of navigation tasks in diverse operational conditions (aquatic, terrestrial and space). By ensuring consistency between simulation and real-world deployment, RoboRAN lowers the barrier to developing adaptable RL-based navigation strategies. Its modular design enables straightforward integration of new robots and tasks through predefined templates, fostering reproducibility and extension to diverse domains. To support the community, we release RoboRAN as open-source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Machine Learning Research (TMLR)</p></details> |

For instance, reward-free and goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first remarking that the successor measure itself is not approximately low-rank. Instead, we demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation and estimation errors are primarily governed by a newly introduced quantitity: the spectral recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 11 figures.

One fundamental challenge in analyzing a stochastic approximation algorithm is to establish its stability, i.e., to show that the stochastic vector iterates are bounded almost surely. In this paper, we extend the celebrated Borkar-Meyn theorem for stability from the Martingale difference noise setting to the Markovian noise setting, which greatly improves its applicability in reinforcement learning, especially in those off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation and eligibility traces. Central to our analysis is the diminishing asymptotic rate of change of a few functions, which is implied by both a form of the strong law of large numbers and a form of the law of the iterated logarithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR), 2025</p></details> |

The investigation of their convergence properties is not only a major research topic during the early development of the RL field but also receives increasing attention nowadays. This paper formally verifies their almost sure convergence in a unified framework based on the Robbins-Siegmund theorem. The framework developed in this work can be easily extended to convergence rates and other modes of convergence. This work thus makes an important step towards fully formalizing convergent RL results. The code is available at https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/rl-theory-in-lean.</p></details> |  |
| **[Going Beyond Expert Performance via Deep Implicit Imitation Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03616v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning. This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature. HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset sizes and hyperparameter configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor-Efficient High-Dimensional Q-learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03595v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional reinforcement learning faces challenges with complex calculations and low sample efficiency in large state-action spaces. Q-learning algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods, we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling costs are high.</p></details> |  |
| **[PerfDojo: Automated ML Library Generation for Heterogeneous Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03586v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing complexity of machine learning models and the proliferation of diverse hardware architectures (CPUs, GPUs, accelerators) make achieving optimal performance a significant challenge. Heterogeneity in instruction sets, specialized kernel requirements for different data types and model features (e.g., sparsity, quantization), and architecture-specific optimizations complicate performance tuning. Manual optimization is resource-intensive, while existing automatic approaches often rely on complex hardware-specific heuristics and uninterpretable intermediate representations, hindering performance portability. We introduce PerfLLM, a novel automatic optimization methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Central to this is PerfDojo, an environment framing optimization as an RL game using a human-readable, mathematically-inspired code representation that guarantees semantic validity through transformations. This allows effective optimization without prior hardware knowledge, facilitating both human analysis and RL agent training. We demonstrate PerfLLM's ability to achieve significant performance gains across diverse CPU (x86, Arm, RISC-V) and GPU architectures.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Foundations for Deep Research Systems: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06733v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator, and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback. Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent, off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration, recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence on such human priors and rater biases. This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations of deep research systems. It systematizes recent work along three axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii) agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA, VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, second version</p></details> |

Revisiting GRPO in Classical Reinforcement Learning Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03527v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting (gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes. These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to learned value functions.</p></details> |  |

We propose Anchored Direct Preference Optimization (ADPO), a theoretically grounded framework that extends preference learning to soft, listwise supervision through reference anchoring. Our key theoretical contributions are threefold: (1) we establish that ADPO unifies major learning paradigms, including supervised fine-tuning, knowledge distillation, maximum-entropy reinforcement learning, and DPO, as special cases through different choices of target distribution, anchor policy, and temperature; (2) we prove that anchoring induces an implicit trust region governed by the softmax Fisher metric; and (3) we formalize the stability of dynamic anchor updates. Empirically, we discover a task-dependent tradeoff: dynamic anchors suit online exploration, while fixed anchors excel at offline distillation, reducing teacher-student KL divergence by two to three orders of magnitude (170 to 5000 times).</p></details> |  |
| **[ViFP: A Framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04201v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During reasoning in vision-language models (VLMs), false positive (FP) reasoning occurs when a model produces the correct answer but follows an incorrect reasoning path, resulting in undermined reasoning reliability. Existing approaches mainly rely on prompt engineering, knowledge distillation or reinforcement learning to improve reasoning reliability, both of which require large amounts of high-quality data and thus limit practical applicability. Few approaches have focused on directly detecting and correcting FPs. To address these issues, we propose ViFP, a framework for Visual False Positive Detection to Enhance Reasoning Reliability in VLMs. ViFP builds effective reasoning paths through multi-turn QA and dynamically analyzes the consistency of the reasoning path to identify potential FPs. It also introduces a targeted reasoning chain correction mechanism to modify FP reasoning, thereby improving logical consistency and accuracy. Finally, we introduce a reliability evaluation metric, VoC, which integrates answer accuracy and the FP rate, providing a quantitative tool to assess whether a VLM not only answers correctly but also reasons reliably. Our experiments on closed-source VLMs show that ViFP consistently improves performance across three datasets: A-OKVQA, OK-VQA, and FVQA. On A-OKVQA, ViFP improves accuracy by up to 5.4%, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art by 4.3%, and significantly reduces the number of FPs, validating its benefits in enhancing reasoning reliability.</p></details> |  |

This paper develops a theoretical and algorithmic framework for incorporating known group symmetries into kernel-based RL. We propose a symmetry-aware variant of optimistic least-squares value iteration (LSVI), which leverages invariant kernels to encode invariance in both rewards and transition dynamics. Our analysis establishes new bounds on the maximum information gain and covering numbers for invariant RKHSs, explicitly quantifying the sample efficiency gains from symmetry. Empirical results on a customized Frozen Lake environment and a 2D placement design problem confirm the theoretical improvements, demonstrating that symmetry-aware RL achieves significantly better performance than their standard kernel counterparts. These findings highlight the value of structural priors in designing more sample-efficient reinforcement learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) struggle with this task, frequently failing to interpret user intent (misinterpretation) or unnecessarily altering the original question's structure (over-correction). We propose QuestionRAG, a framework that tackles these problems. To address misinterpretation, it enriches the input with external knowledge (e.g., search results, related entities). To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's ability to follow instructions and generalize. By integrating these two strategies, QuestionRAG unlocks the full potential of LLMs for the question correction task.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

This combination makes them also suitable for classical search problems. However, the original method of training the network with simulation results is limited in sparse reward settings, especially in the early stages, where the network cannot yet give guidance. Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) addresses this issue by relabeling unsuccessful trajectories from the search tree as supervised learning signals. We introduce Adaptable HER (\ours{}), a flexible framework that integrates HER with AlphaZero, allowing easy adjustments to HER properties such as relabeled goals, policy targets, and trajectory selection. Our experiments, including equation discovery, show that the possibility of modifying HER is beneficial and surpasses the performance of pure supervised or reinforcement learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, Presented at the 9th International Workshop on Interactive Adaptive Learning</p></details> |

Centralized architectures fall short in addressing these demands, often resulting in elevated energy consumption, latency, and privacy concerns. This paper proposes MetaFed, a decentralized federated learning (FL) framework that enables sustainable and intelligent resource orchestration for Metaverse environments. MetaFed integrates (i) multi-agent reinforcement learning for dynamic client selection, (ii) privacy-preserving FL using homomorphic encryption, and (iii) carbon-aware scheduling aligned with renewable energy availability. Evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 using lightweight ResNet architectures demonstrate that MetaFed achieves up to 25% reduction in carbon emissions compared to conventional approaches, while maintaining high accuracy and minimal communication overhead. These results highlight MetaFed as a scalable solution for building environmentally responsible and privacy-compliant Metaverse infrastructures.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE International Symposium on Emerging Metaverse (ISEMV), co-located with the 2025 IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV)</p></details> |
| **[Learning Communication Skills in Multi-task Multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03348v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can communicate with one another to perform a task in a coordinated manner. When multiple tasks are involved, agents can also leverage knowledge from one task to improve learning in other tasks. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Communication Skills (MCS), a MADRL with communication method that learns and performs multiple tasks simultaneously, with agents interacting through learnable communication protocols. MCS employs a Transformer encoder to encode task-specific observations into a shared message space, capturing shared communication skills among agents. To enhance coordination among agents, we introduce a prediction network that correlates messages with the actions of sender agents in each task. We adapt three multi-agent benchmark environments to multi-task settings, where the number of agents as well as the observation and action spaces vary across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MCS achieves better performance than multi-task MADRL baselines without communication, as well as single-task MADRL baselines with and without communication.</p></details> | 20 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Decentralized Aerial Manipulation of a Cable-Suspended Load using Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01522v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first decentralized method to enable real-world 6-DoF manipulation of a cable-suspended load using a team of Micro-Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our method leverages multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to train an outer-loop control policy for each MAV. Unlike state-of-the-art controllers that utilize a centralized scheme, our policy does not require global states, inter-MAV communications, nor neighboring MAV information. Instead, agents communicate implicitly through load pose observations alone, which enables high scalability and flexibility. It also significantly reduces computing costs during inference time, enabling onboard deployment of the policy. In addition, we introduce a new action space design for the MAVs using linear acceleration and body rates. This choice, combined with a robust low-level controller, enables reliable sim-to-real transfer despite significant uncertainties caused by cable tension during dynamic 3D motion. We validate our method in various real-world experiments, including full-pose control under load model uncertainties, showing setpoint tracking performance comparable to the state-of-the-art centralized method. We also demonstrate cooperation amongst agents with heterogeneous control policies, and robustness to the complete in-flight loss of one MAV.

| **[DRL-Based Robust Multi-Timescale Anti-Jamming Approaches under State Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03305v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Owing to the openness of wireless channels, wireless communication systems are highly susceptible to malicious jamming. Most existing anti-jamming methods rely on the assumption of accurate sensing and optimize parameters on a single timescale. However, such methods overlook two practical issues: mismatched execution latencies across heterogeneous actions and measurement errors caused by sensor imperfections. Especially for deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods, the inherent sensitivity of neural networks implies that even minor perturbations in the input can mislead the agent into choosing suboptimal actions, with potentially severe consequences. To ensure reliable wireless transmission, we establish a multi-timescale decision model that incorporates state uncertainty. Subsequently, we propose two robust schemes that sustain performance under bounded sensing errors. First, a Projected Gradient Descent-assisted Double Deep Q-Network (PGD-DDQN) algorithm is designed, which derives worst-case perturbations under a norm-bounded error model and applies PGD during training for robust optimization. Second, a Nonlinear Q-Compression DDQN (NQC-DDQN) algorithm introduces a nonlinear compression mechanism that adaptively contracts Q-value ranges to eliminate action aliasing. Simulation results indicate that, compared with the perfect-sensing baseline, the proposed algorithms show only minor degradation in anti-jamming performance while maintaining robustness under various perturbations, thereby validating their practicality in imperfect sensing conditions.</p></details> | 13pages,12figures |
| **[Multi-Objective Adaptive Rate Limiting in Microservices Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03279v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As cloud computing and microservice architectures become increasingly prevalent, API rate limiting has emerged as a critical mechanism for ensuring system stability and service quality. Traditional rate limiting algorithms, such as token bucket and sliding window, while widely adopted, struggle to adapt to dynamic traffic patterns and varying system loads. This paper proposes an adaptive rate limiting strategy based on deep reinforcement learning that dynamically balances system throughput and service latency. We design a hybrid architecture combining Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic (A3C) algorithms, modeling the rate limiting decision process as a Markov Decision Process. The system continuously monitors microservice states and learns optimal rate limiting policies through environmental interaction. Extensive experiments conducted in a Kubernetes cluster environment demonstrate that our approach achieves 23.7% throughput improvement and 31.4% P99 latency reduction compared to traditional fixed-threshold strategies under high-load scenarios. Results from a 90-day production deployment handling 500 million daily requests validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed method, with 82% reduction in service degradation incidents and 68% decrease in manual interventions.</p></details> |  |
| **[L2T-Tune:LLM-Guided Hybrid Database Tuning with LHS and TD3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01602v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Configuration tuning is critical for database performance. Although recent advancements in database tuning have shown promising results in throughput and latency improvement, challenges remain. First, the vast knob space makes direct optimization unstable and slow to converge. Second, reinforcement learning pipelines often lack effective warm-start guidance and require long offline training. Third, transferability is limited: when hardware or workloads change, existing models typically require substantial retraining to recover performance. To address these limitations, we propose L2T-Tune, a new LLM-guided hybrid database tuning framework that features a three-stage pipeline: Stage one performs a warm start that simultaneously generates uniform samples across the knob space and logs them into a shared pool; Stage two leverages a large language model to mine and prioritize tuning hints from manuals and community documents for rapid convergence. Stage three uses the warm-start sample pool to reduce the dimensionality of knobs and state features, then fine-tunes the configuration with the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm. We conduct experiments on L2T-Tune and the state-of-the-art models. Compared with the best-performing alternative, our approach improves performance by an average of 37.1% across all workloads, and by up to 73% on TPC-C. Compared with models trained with reinforcement learning, it achieves rapid convergence in the offline tuning stage on a single server. Moreover, during the online tuning stage, it only takes 30 steps to achieve best results.</p></details> |  |

Designing effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g. economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can alter adaptation policy.

Meanwhile, policymakers must devise adaptation strategies that can cope with the uncertain nature of climate change and the complex and dynamic nature of urban flooding. Reinforcement Learning (RL) holds significant promise in tackling such complex, dynamic, and uncertain problems. Because of this, we use RL to identify which climate adaptation pathways lead to a higher QoL in the long term. We do this using an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) which combines a rainfall projection model, a flood model, a transport accessibility model, and a quality of life index. Our preliminary results suggest that this approach can be used to learn optimal adaptation measures and it outperforms other realistic and real-world planning strategies.

| **[Layer Importance for Mathematical Reasoning is Forged in Pre-Training and Invariant after Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22638v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models improve at math after instruction tuning, reinforcement learning, or knowledge distillation. We ask whether these gains come from major changes in the transformer layers or from smaller adjustments that keep the original structure. Using layer-wise ablation on base and trained variants, we find that math reasoning depends on a few critical layers, which stay important across all post-training methods. Removing these layers reduces math accuracy by as much as 80%, whereas factual recall tasks only show relatively smaller drops. This suggests that specialized layers for mathematical tasks form during pre-training and remain stable afterward. As measured by Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), we find that near these critical layers, tokens drift from their original syntactic clusters toward representations aligned with tokens less syntactically related but potentially more useful for downstream task.</p></details> |  |

| **[Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation via Heat Conduction Equation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03260v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation has been significantly advanced by deep learning architectures, notably U-Net variants. However, existing models struggle to achieve efficient global context modeling and long-range dependency reasoning under practical computational budgets simultaneously. In this work, we propose a novel hybrid architecture utilizing U-Mamba with Heat Conduction Equation. Our model combines Mamba-based state-space modules for efficient long-range reasoning with Heat Conduction Operators (HCOs) in the bottleneck layers, simulating frequency-domain thermal diffusion for enhanced semantic abstraction. Experimental results on multimodal abdominal CT and MRI datasets demonstrate that the proposed model consistently outperforms strong baselines, validating its effectiveness and generalizability. It suggest that blending state-space dynamics with heat-based global diffusion offers a scalable and interpretable solution for medical segmentation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Guided Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing for Endoscopic Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03219v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmentation for dense prediction typically relies on either sample mixing or generative synthesis. Mixing improves robustness but misaligned masks yield soft label ambiguity. Diffusion synthesis increases apparent diversity but, when trained as common samples, overlooks the structural benefit of mask conditioning and introduces synthetic-real domain shift. We propose a paired, diffusion-guided paradigm that fuses the strengths of both. For each real image, a synthetic counterpart is generated under the same mask and the pair is used as a controllable input for Mask-Consistent Paired Mixing (MCPMix), which mixes only image appearance while supervision always uses the original hard mask. This produces a continuous family of intermediate samples that smoothly bridges synthetic and real appearances under shared geometry, enlarging diversity without compromising pixel-level semantics. To keep learning aligned with real data, Real-Anchored Learnable Annealing (RLA) adaptively adjusts the mixing strength and the loss weight of mixed samples over training, gradually re-anchoring optimization to real data and mitigating distributional bias. Across Kvasir-SEG, PICCOLO, CVC-ClinicDB, a private NPC-LES cohort, and ISIC 2017, the approach achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and consistent gains over baselines. The results show that combining label-preserving mixing with diffusion-driven diversity, together with adaptive re-anchoring, yields robust and generalizable endoscopic segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[BoxCell: Leveraging SAM for Cell Segmentation with Box Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17960v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cell segmentation in histopathological images is vital for diagnosis, and treatment of several diseases. Annotating data is tedious, and requires medical expertise, making it difficult to employ supervised learning. Instead, we study a weakly supervised setting, where only bounding box supervision is available, and present the use of Segment Anything (SAM) for this without any finetuning, i.e., directly utilizing the pre-trained model. We propose BoxCell, a cell segmentation framework that utilizes SAM's capability to interpret bounding boxes as prompts, \emph{both} at train and test times. At train time, gold bounding boxes given to SAM produce (pseudo-)masks, which are used to train a standalone segmenter. At test time, BoxCell generates two segmentation masks: (1) generated by this standalone segmenter, and (2) a trained object detector outputs bounding boxes, which are given as prompts to SAM to produce another mask. Recognizing complementary strengths, we reconcile the two segmentation masks using a novel integer programming formulation with intensity and spatial constraints. We experiment on three publicly available cell segmentation datasets namely, CoNSep, MoNuSeg, and TNBC, and find that BoxCell significantly outperforms existing box supervised image segmentation models, obtaining 6-10 point Dice gains.</p></details> |  |

It allows for the exact delineation of anatomical and pathological features in two- or three-dimensional pictures by utilizing notions like pixel intensity, texture, and anatomical context. With the advent of automated segmentation, physicians and radiologists may now concentrate on diagnosis and treatment planning while intelligent computers perform routine image processing tasks. This study used the BraTS Sub-Saharan Africa dataset, a selected subset of the BraTS dataset that included 60 multimodal MRI cases from patients with glioma. Surprisingly, the nnU Net model trained on the initial 60 instances performed better than the network trained on an offline-augmented dataset of 360 cases. Hypothetically, the offline augmentations introduced artificial anatomical variances or intensity distributions, reducing generalization. In contrast, the original dataset, when paired with nnU Net's robust online augmentation procedures, maintained realistic variability and produced better results. The study achieved a Dice score of 0.84 for whole tumor segmentation. These findings highlight the significance of data quality and proper augmentation approaches in constructing accurate, generalizable medical picture segmentation models, particularly for under-represented locations.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Label tree semantic losses for rich multi-class medical image segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15777v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rich and accurate medical image segmentation is poised to underpin the next generation of AI-defined clinical practice by delineating critical anatomy for pre-operative planning, guiding real-time intra-operative navigation, and supporting precise post-operative assessment. However, commonly used learning methods for medical and surgical imaging segmentation tasks penalise all errors equivalently and thus fail to exploit any inter-class semantics in the labels space. This becomes particularly problematic as the cardinality and richness of labels increases to include subtly different classes. In this work, we propose two tree-based semantic loss functions which take advantage of a hierarchical organisation of the labels. We further incorporate our losses in a recently proposed approach for training with sparse, background-free annotations to extend the applicability of our proposed losses. Extensive experiments are reported on two medical and surgical image segmentation tasks, namely head MRI for whole brain parcellation (WBP) with full supervision and neurosurgical hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for scene understanding with sparse annotations. Results demonstrate that our proposed method reaches state-of-the-art performance in both cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Progressive Growing of Patch Size: Curriculum Learning for Accelerated and Improved Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23241v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably, across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Extension of "Progressive Growing of Patch Size: Resource-Efficient Curriculum Learning for Dense Prediction Tasks" (MICCAI2024) submitted to MedIA</p></details> |

We propose RDTE-UNet, a segmentation network that unifies local modeling with global context to strengthen boundary delineation and detail preservation. RDTE-UNet employs a hybrid ResBlock detail-aware Transformer backbone and three modules: ASBE for adaptive boundary enhancement, HVDA for fine-grained feature modeling, and EulerFF for fusion weighting guided by Euler's formula.

| **[Scalable Maxflow Processing for Dynamic Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01235v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Maximum Flow (Max-Flow) problem is a cornerstone in graph theory and combinatorial optimization, aiming to determine the largest possible flow from a designated source node to a sink node within a capacitated flow network. It has extensive applications across diverse domains such as computer networking, transportation systems, and image segmentation. The objective is to maximize the total throughput while respecting edge capacity constraints and maintaining flow conservation at all intermediate vertices. Among the various algorithms proposed for solving the Max-Flow problem, the Push--Relabel algorithm is particularly notable for its efficiency and suitability for parallelization, owing to its localized vertex-based operations. This property has motivated extensive research into GPU-accelerated Max-Flow computation, leveraging the high degree of parallelism inherent to modern GPU architectures. In this paper, we present a novel GPU-parallel Max-Flow algorithm capable of incrementally recomputing the maximum flow of a dynamic graph following a batch of edge updates. In addition, we introduce a high-performance static GPU algorithm designed for efficiently computing the initial Max-Flow on static graphs. We further describe a series of CUDA-specific implementation optimizations that enhance performance, scalability, and memory efficiency on GPU platforms.</p></details> |  |

However, current deep learning-based polyp segmentation models either compromise clinical decision-making by providing ambiguous polyp margins in segmentation outputs or rely on heavy architectures with high computational complexity, resulting in insufficient inference speeds for real-time colorectal endoscopic applications. To address this problem, we propose MicroAUNet, a light-weighted attention-based segmentation network that combines depthwise-separable dilated convolutions with a single-path, parameter-shared channel-spatial attention block to strengthen multi-scale boundary features. On the basis of it, a progressive two-stage knowledge-distillation scheme is introduced to transfer semantic and boundary cues from a high-capacity teacher. Extensive experiments on benchmarks also demonstrate the state-of-the-art accuracy under extremely low model complexity, indicating that MicroAUNet is suitable for real-time clinical polyp segmentation.

However, FL systems remain vulnerable to membership-inference attacks and data heterogeneity. This paper presents FedOnco-Bench, a reproducible benchmark for privacy-aware FL using synthetic oncologic CT scans with tumor annotations. It evaluates segmentation performance and privacy leakage across FL methods: FedAvg, FedProx, FedBN, and FedAvg with DP-SGD. Results show a distinct trade-off between privacy and utility: FedAvg is high performance (Dice around 0.85) with more privacy leakage (attack AUC about 0.72), while DP-SGD provides a higher level of privacy (AUC around 0.25) at the cost of accuracy (Dice about 0.79). FedProx and FedBN offer balanced performance under heterogeneous data, especially with non-identical distributed client data. FedOnco-Bench serves as a standardized, open-source platform for benchmarking and developing privacy-preserving FL methods for medical image segmentation.</p></details> | Published in IEEE |

Traditional, fully-supervised segmentation models rely on large amounts of labeled training data, typically obtained through manual annotation, which can be an expensive, time-consuming, and error-prone process. This signals a need for accurate, automatic, and annotation-efficient methods of training these models. We propose ADA-SAM (automated, domain-specific, and adaptive segment anything model), a novel multitask learning framework for medical image segmentation that leverages class activation maps from an auxiliary classifier to guide the predictions of the semi-supervised segmentation branch, which is based on the Segment Anything (SAM) framework. Additionally, our ADA-SAM model employs a novel gradient feedback mechanism to create a learnable connection between the segmentation and classification branches by using the segmentation gradients to guide and improve the classification predictions. We validate ADA-SAM on real-world clinical data collected during rehabilitation trials, and demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms both fully-supervised and semi-supervised baselines by double digits in limited label settings.

As improvements in image segmentation become increasingly challenging to achieve, combining image matting and grayscale segmentation techniques offers promising new directions for architectural innovation. Inspired by the possibility of aligning these two model tasks, we propose a new architectural approach for DIS called Confidence-Guided Matting (CGM). We created the first CGM model called Background Erase Network (BEN). BEN consists of two components: BEN Base for initial segmentation and BEN Refiner for confidence-based refinement. Our approach achieves substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods on the DIS5K validation dataset, demonstrating that matting-based refinement can significantly enhance segmentation quality.

However, existing methods primarily focus on designing and combining various perturbation schemes, overlooking the inherent potential and limitations within the framework itself. In this paper, we first identify two critical deficiencies: (1) separated training data streams, which lead to confirmation bias dominated by the labeled stream; and (2) incomplete utilization of supervisory information, which limits exploration of strong-to-weak consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a style-aware blending and prototype-based cross-contrast consistency learning framework. Specifically, inspired by the empirical observation that the distribution mismatch between labeled and unlabeled data can be characterized by statistical moments, we design a style-guided distribution blending module to break the independent training data streams. Meanwhile, considering the potential noise in strong pseudo-labels, we introduce a prototype-based cross-contrast strategy to encourage the model to learn informative supervisory signals from both weak-to-strong and strong-to-weak predictions, while mitigating the adverse effects of noise. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our framework across multiple medical segmentation benchmarks under various semi-supervised settings.</p></details> |  |

This need is particularly pronounced in mobile medical devices, which require lightweight, deployable models with real-time performance. However, existing lightweight models often suffer from poor robustness across datasets, limiting their widespread adoption. To address these challenges, this paper introduces LV-UNet, a lightweight and vanilla model that leverages pre-trained MobileNetv3-Large backbones and incorporates fusible modules.

Investigating Age and Ethnic Bias in the MAMA-MIA Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27421v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models aim to improve diagnostic workflows, but fairness evaluation remains underexplored beyond classification, e.g., in image segmentation. Unaddressed segmentation bias can lead to disparities in the quality of care for certain populations, potentially compounded across clinical decision points and amplified through iterative model development. Here, we audit the fairness of the automated segmentation labels provided in the breast cancer tumor segmentation dataset MAMA-MIA. We evaluate automated segmentation quality across age, ethnicity, and data source. Our analysis reveals an intrinsic age-related bias against younger patients that continues to persist even after controlling for confounding factors, such as data source. We hypothesize that this bias may be linked to physiological factors, a known challenge for both radiologists and automated systems. Finally, we show how aggregating data from multiple data sources influences site-specific ethnic biases, underscoring the necessity of investigating data at a granular level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Imaging Meets EurIPS (NeurIPS-endorsed workshop) - MedEurIPS</p></details> |
| **[BALR-SAM: Boundary-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of SAM for Resource-Efficient Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24204v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM), pretrained on large-scale natural image datasets, often struggle in medical image segmentation due to a lack of domain-specific adaptation. In clinical practice, fine-tuning such models efficiently for medical downstream tasks with minimal resource demands, while maintaining strong performance, is challenging. To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.</p></details> |  |

| **[SPG-CDENet: Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network for Multi-Organ Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26390v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-organ segmentation is a critical task in computer-aided diagnosis. While recent deep learning methods have achieved remarkable success in image segmentation, huge variations in organ size and shape challenge their effectiveness in multi-organ segmentation. To address these challenges, we propose a Spatial Prior-Guided Cross Dual Encoder Network (SPG-CDENet), a novel two-stage segmentation paradigm designed to improve multi-organ segmentation accuracy. Our SPG-CDENet consists of two key components: a spatial prior network and a cross dual encoder network. The prior network generates coarse localization maps that delineate the approximate ROI, serving as spatial guidance for the dual encoder network. The cross dual encoder network comprises four essential components: a global encoder, a local encoder, a symmetric cross-attention module, and a flow-based decoder. The global encoder captures global semantic features from the entire image, while the local encoder focuses on features from the prior network. To enhance the interaction between the global and local encoders, a symmetric cross-attention module is proposed across all layers of the encoders to fuse and refine features. Furthermore, the flow-based decoder directly propagates high-level semantic features from the final encoder layer to all decoder layers, maximizing feature preservation and utilization. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the superior performance of SPG-CDENet compared to existing segmentation methods. Furthermore, ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules in improving segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, the segmentation of CT images is impeded by low contrast and complex vertebral boundaries. Although advanced models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) have shown promise in various segmentation tasks, their performance in spinal CT imaging is limited by high annotation requirements and poor domain adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose SpinalSAM-R1, a multimodal vision-language interactive system that integrates a fine-tuned SAM with DeepSeek-R1, for spine CT image segmentation. Specifically, our SpinalSAM-R1 introduces an anatomy-guided attention mechanism to improve spine segmentation performance, and a semantics-driven interaction protocol powered by DeepSeek-R1, enabling natural language-guided refinement. The SpinalSAM-R1 is fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient adaptation. We validate our SpinalSAM-R1 on the spine anatomical structure with CT images. Experimental results suggest that our method achieves superior segmentation performance. Meanwhile, we develop a PyQt5-based interactive software, which supports point, box, and text-based prompts. The system supports 11 clinical operations with 94.3\% parsing accuracy and sub-800 ms response times.

Automatic segmentation of musculoskeletal structures in ultrasound (US) can improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning. Fractures appear as cortical defects but require expert interpretation. Deep learning (DL) can provide real-time feedback and highlight key structures, helping lightly trained users perform exams more confidently. However, pixel-wise expert annotations for training remain time-consuming and costly. To address this challenge, we propose FlexICL, a novel and flexible in-context learning (ICL) framework for segmenting bony regions in US images. We apply it to an intra-video segmentation setting, where experts annotate only a small subset of frames, and the model segments unseen frames. We systematically investigate various image concatenation techniques and training strategies for visual ICL and introduce novel concatenation methods that significantly enhance model performance with limited labeled data. By integrating multiple augmentation strategies, FlexICL achieves robust segmentation performance across four wrist and elbow US datasets while requiring only 5% of the training images. It outperforms state-of-the-art visual ICL models like Painter, MAE-VQGAN, and conventional segmentation models like U-Net and TransUNet by 1-27% Dice coefficient on 1,252 US sweeps. These initial results highlight the potential of FlexICL as an efficient and scalable solution for US image segmentation well suited for medical imaging use cases where labeled data is scarce.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+ with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights. Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance. ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of 0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ScribbleVS: Scribble-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Dynamic Competitive Pseudo Label Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10237v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In clinical medicine, precise image segmentation can provide substantial support to clinicians. However, obtaining high-quality segmentation typically demands extensive pixel-level annotations, which are labor-intensive and expensive. Scribble annotations offer a more cost-effective alternative by improving labeling efficiency. Nonetheless, using such sparse supervision for training reliable medical image segmentation models remains a significant challenge. Some studies employ pseudo-labeling to enhance supervision, but these methods are susceptible to noise interference. To address these challenges, we introduce ScribbleVS, a framework designed to learn from scribble annotations. We introduce a Regional Pseudo Labels Diffusion Module to expand the scope of supervision and reduce the impact of noise present in pseudo labels. Additionally, we introduce a Dynamic Competitive Selection module for enhanced refinement in selecting pseudo labels. Experiments conducted on the ACDC, MSCMRseg, WORD, and BraTS2020 datasets demonstrate promising results, achieving segmentation precision comparable to fully supervised models.

We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First, unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods, delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation for Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08549v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.</p></details> | Under Review |

However, existing models are often task-specific, with performance varying across modalities and anatomical regions. Balancing model complexity and performance remains challenging, particularly in clinical settings where both accuracy and efficiency are critical. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid segmentation architecture featuring a three-branch encoder that integrates CNNs, Transformers, and a Mamba-based Attention Fusion (MAF) mechanism to capture local, global, and long-range dependencies. A multi-scale attention-based CNN decoder reconstructs fine-grained segmentation maps while preserving contextual consistency. Additionally, a co-attention gate enhances feature selection by emphasizing relevant spatial and semantic information across scales during both encoding and decoding, improving feature interaction and cross-scale communication. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and generalization, while maintaining comparable computational complexity. By effectively balancing efficiency and effectiveness, our architecture offers a practical and scalable solution for diverse medical imaging tasks. Source code and trained models will be publicly released upon acceptance to support reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of fully annotated datasets and strict privacy regulations present significant barriers to data sharing. Federated Learning (FL) allows decentralized model training, but existing FL methods often struggle with partial labeling, leading to model divergence and catastrophic forgetting. We propose ConDistFL, a novel FL framework incorporating conditional distillation to address these challenges. ConDistFL enables effective learning from partially labeled datasets, significantly improving segmentation accuracy across distributed and non-uniform datasets. In addition to its superior segmentation performance, ConDistFL maintains computational and communication efficiency, ensuring its scalability for real-world applications. Furthermore, ConDistFL demonstrates remarkable generalizability, significantly outperforming existing FL methods in out-of-federation tests, even adapting to unseen contrast phases (e.g., non-contrast CT images) in our experiments. Extensive evaluations on 3D CT and 2D chest X-ray datasets show that ConDistFL is an efficient, adaptable solution for collaborative medical image segmentation in privacy-constrained settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was submitted to IEEE JBHI and is currently under peer review</p></details> |

Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty, which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated. Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.

Its successor, SAM2, has attracted significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2 significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

These outputs include architectural elements like walls, doors, windows, and oriented object boxes with their semantic categories. Unlike previous methods which exploit task-specific network designs, our model adheres to the standard multimodal LLM architecture and is fine-tuned directly from open-source LLMs. To train SpatialLM, we collect a large-scale, high-quality synthetic dataset consisting of the point clouds of 12,328 indoor scenes (54,778 rooms) with ground-truth 3D annotations, and conduct a careful study on various modeling and training decisions. On public benchmarks, our model gives state-of-the-art performance in layout estimation and competitive results in 3D object detection.

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo and OpenVLA. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

Dependable perception is one of the initial stages for ISC-aware robots. However, this is hampered by the absence of a dedicated image corpus, as collecting photographs on active construction sites is logistically difficult and raises safety and privacy concerns. In response, we introduce ISC-Perception, the first hybrid dataset expressly designed for ISC component detection. It blends procedurally rendered CAD images, game-engine photorealistic scenes, and a limited, curated set of real photographs, enabling fully automatic labelling of the synthetic portion. We explicitly account for all human effort to produce the dataset, including simulation engine and scene setup, asset preparation, post-processing scripts and quality checks; our total human time to generate a 10,000-image dataset was 30.5,h versus 166.7,h for manual labelling at 60,s per image (-81.7%). A manual pilot on a representative image with five instances of ISC members took 60,s (maximum 80,s), anchoring the manual baseline. Detectors trained on ISC-Perception achieved a mean Average Precision at IoU 0.50 of 0.756, substantially surpassing models trained on synthetic-only or photorealistic-only data. On a 1,200-frame bench test, we report mAP@0.50/mAP@[0.50:0.95] of 0.943/0.823. By bridging the data gap for construction-robotics perception, ISC-Perception facilitates rapid development of custom object detectors and is freely available for research and industrial use upon request.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention poses a significant barrier to scalability, particularly for large models and high-resolution images. While the linear-complexity Mamba architecture offers a promising alternative, existing RS applications of Mamba remain limited to supervised tasks on small, domain-specific datasets. To address these challenges, we propose RoMA, a framework that enables scalable self-supervised pretraining of Mamba-based RS foundation models using large-scale, diverse, unlabeled data. RoMA enhances scalability for high-resolution images through a tailored auto-regressive learning strategy, incorporating two key innovations: 1) a rotation-aware pretraining mechanism combining adaptive cropping with angular embeddings to handle sparsely distributed objects with arbitrary orientations, and 2) multi-scale token prediction objectives that address the extreme variations in object scales inherent to RS imagery. Systematic empirical studies validate that Mamba adheres to RS data and parameter scaling laws, with performance scaling reliably as model and data size increase. Furthermore, experiments across scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that RoMA-pretrained Mamba models consistently outperform ViT-based counterparts in both accuracy and computational efficiency.

To address this gap, we introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world scenarios.

However, in GNSS-denied areas, satellite-based localization methods are prone to failure. This paper presents a cross-view UAV localization framework that performs map matching via object detection, aimed at effectively addressing cross-temporal, cross-view, heterogeneous aerial image matching. In typical pipelines, UAV visual localization is formulated as an image-retrieval problem: features are extracted to build a localization map, and the pose of a query image is estimated by matching it to a reference database with known poses. Because publicly available UAV localization datasets are limited, many approaches recast localization as a classification task and rely on scene labels in these datasets to ensure accuracy. Other methods seek to reduce cross-domain differences using polar-coordinate reprojection, perspective transformations, or generative adversarial networks; however, they can suffer from misalignment, content loss, and limited realism. In contrast, we leverage modern object detection to accurately extract salient instances from UAV and satellite images, and integrate a graph neural network to reason about inter-image and intra-image node relationships. Using a fine-grained, graph-based node-similarity metric, our method achieves strong retrieval and localization performance. Extensive experiments on public and real-world datasets show that our approach handles heterogeneous appearance differences effectively and generalizes well, making it applicable to scenarios with larger modality gaps, such as infrared-visible image matching.

While recent transformer-based detectors like RT-DETR have shown promise in object detection tasks, their application to medical imaging, particularly pneumonia detection in chest X-rays, remains underexplored. This paper presents CGF-DETR, an enhanced real-time detection transformer specifically designed for pneumonia detection. We introduce XFABlock in the backbone to improve multi-scale feature extraction through convolutional attention mechanisms integrated with CSP architecture. To achieve efficient feature aggregation, we propose SPGA module that replaces standard multi-head attention with dynamic gating mechanisms and single-head self-attention. Additionally, GCFC3 is designed for the neck to enhance feature representation through multi-path convolution fusion while maintaining real-time performance via structural re-parameterization.

| **[Deep Fourier-embedded Network for RGB and Thermal Salient Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18409v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of deep learning has significantly improved salient object detection (SOD) combining both RGB and thermal (RGB-T) images. However, existing Transformer-based RGB-T SOD models with quadratic complexity are memory-intensive, limiting their application in high-resolution bimodal feature fusion. To overcome this limitation, we propose a purely Fourier Transform-based model, namely Deep Fourier-embedded Network (FreqSal), for accurate RGB-T SOD. Specifically, we leverage the efficiency of Fast Fourier Transform with linear complexity to design three key components: (1) To fuse RGB and thermal modalities, we propose Modal-coordinated Perception Attention, which aligns and enhances bimodal Fourier representation in multiple dimensions; (2) To clarify object edges and suppress noise, we design Frequency-decomposed Edge-aware Block, which deeply decomposes and filters Fourier components of low-level features; (3) To accurately decode features, we propose Fourier Residual Channel Attention Block, which prioritizes high-frequency information while aligning channel-wise global relationships. Additionally, even when converged, existing deep learning-based SOD models' predictions still exhibit frequency gaps relative to ground-truth. To address this problem, we propose Co-focus Frequency Loss, which dynamically weights hard frequencies during edge frequency reconstruction by cross-referencing bimodal edge information in the Fourier domain. Extensive experiments on ten bimodal SOD benchmark datasets demonstrate that FreqSal outperforms twenty-nine existing state-of-the-art bimodal SOD models. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the value and effectiveness of our newly proposed components.

Particularly in the field of sensing, 3D point cloud data collected by LiDAR is utilized to run deep neural network models for 3D object detection. However, these state-of-the-art models are complex, leading to longer processing times and increased power consumption on edge devices. The objective of this study is to address these issues by leveraging Split Computing, a distributed machine learning inference method. Split Computing aims to lessen the computational burden on edge devices, thereby reducing processing time and power consumption. Furthermore, it minimizes the risk of data breaches by only transmitting intermediate data from the deep neural network model. Experimental results show that splitting after voxelization reduces the inference time by 70.8% and the edge device execution time by 90.0%. When splitting within the network, the inference time is reduced by up to 57.1%, and the edge device execution time is reduced by up to 69.5%.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages.

| **[Parameterized Prompt for Incremental Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27316v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have demonstrated that incorporating trainable prompts into pretrained models enables effective incremental learning. However, the application of prompts in incremental object detection (IOD) remains underexplored. Existing prompts pool based approaches assume disjoint class sets across incremental tasks, which are unsuitable for IOD as they overlook the inherent co-occurrence phenomenon in detection images. In co-occurring scenarios, unlabeled objects from previous tasks may appear in current task images, leading to confusion in prompts pool. In this paper, we hold that prompt structures should exhibit adaptive consolidation properties across tasks, with constrained updates to prevent catastrophic forgetting. Motivated by this, we introduce Parameterized Prompts for Incremental Object Detection (P$^2$IOD). Leveraging neural networks global evolution properties, P$^2$IOD employs networks as the parameterized prompts to adaptively consolidate knowledge across tasks. To constrain prompts structure updates, P$^2$IOD further engages a parameterized prompts fusion strategy. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC2007 and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that P$^2$IOD's effectiveness in IOD and achieves the state-of-the-art performance among existing baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[WXSOD: A Benchmark for Robust Salient Object Detection in Adverse Weather Conditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12250v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) in complex environments remains a challenging research topic. Most existing methods perform well in natural scenes with negligible noise, and tend to leverage multi-modal information (e.g., depth and infrared) to enhance accuracy. However, few studies are concerned with the damage of weather noise on SOD performance due to the lack of dataset with pixel-wise annotations. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces a novel Weather-eXtended Salient Object Detection (WXSOD) dataset. It consists of 14,945 RGB images with diverse weather noise, along with the corresponding ground truth annotations and weather labels. To verify algorithm generalization, WXSOD contains two test sets, i.e., a synthesized test set and a real test set. The former is generated by adding weather noise to clean images, while the latter contains real-world weather noise. Based on WXSOD, we propose an efficient baseline, termed Weather-aware Feature Aggregation Network (WFANet), which adopts a fully supervised two-branch architecture. Specifically, the weather prediction branch mines weather-related deep features, while the saliency detection branch fuses semantic features extracted from the backbone with weather features for SOD. Comprehensive comparisons against 17 SOD methods shows that our WFANet achieves superior performance on WXSOD. The code and benchmark results will be made publicly available at https://github.com/C-water/WXSOD</p></details> | Under review |

In this paper, we present a unified autonomous driving model, UniLION, which efficiently handles large-scale LiDAR point clouds, high-resolution multi-view images, and even temporal sequences based on the linear group RNN operator (i.e., performs linear RNN for grouped features). Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single versatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized variants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal temporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or multi-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive and even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks, including 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D occupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion prediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm naturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous driving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope UniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models in autonomous driving. Code is available at https://github.com/happinesslz/UniLION</p></details> |  |

Existing event detectors, however, are limited by fixed-frequency paradigms and fail to fully exploit the high-temporal resolution and adaptability of event data. To address these limitations, we propose FlexEvent, a novel framework that enables detection at varying frequencies. Our approach consists of two key components: FlexFuse, an adaptive event-frame fusion module that integrates high-frequency event data with rich semantic information from RGB frames, and FlexTune, a frequency-adaptive fine-tuning mechanism that generates frequency-adjusted labels to enhance model generalization across varying operational frequencies. This combination allows our method to detect objects with high accuracy in both fast-moving and static scenarios, while adapting to dynamic environments. Extensive experiments on large-scale event camera datasets demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, achieving significant improvements in both standard and high-frequency settings. Notably, our method maintains robust performance when scaling from 20 Hz to 90 Hz and delivers accurate detection up to 180 Hz, proving its effectiveness in extreme conditions. Our framework sets a new benchmark for event-based object detection and paves the way for more adaptable, real-time vision systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 28 pages, 14 figures, 10 tables; Code at https://flexevent.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Contrast-Guided Cross-Modal Distillation for Thermal Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01435v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust perception at night remains challenging for thermal-infrared detection: low contrast and weak high-frequency cues lead to duplicate, overlapping boxes, missed small objects, and class confusion. Prior remedies either translate TIR to RGB and hope pixel fidelity transfers to detection -- making performance fragile to color or structure artifacts -- or fuse RGB and TIR at test time, which requires extra sensors, precise calibration, and higher runtime cost. Both lines can help in favorable conditions, but do not directly shape the thermal representation used by the detector. We keep mono-modality inference and tackle the root causes during training. Specifically, we introduce training-only objectives that sharpen instance-level decision boundaries by pulling together features of the same class and pushing apart those of different classes -- suppressing duplicate and confusing detections -- and that inject cross-modal semantic priors by aligning the student's multi-level pyramid features with an RGB-trained teacher, thereby strengthening texture-poor thermal features without visible input at test time. In experiments, our method outperformed prior approaches and achieved state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Agnostic Instance-level Descriptor for Visual Instance Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16745v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the great success of the deep features in content-based image retrieval, the visual instance search remains challenging due to the lack of effective instance-level feature representation. Supervised or weakly supervised object detection methods are not the appropriate solutions due to their poor performance on the unknown object categories. In this paper, based on the feature set output from self-supervised ViT, the instance-level region discovery is modeled as detecting the compact feature subsets in a hierarchical fashion. The hierarchical decomposition results in a hierarchy of instance regions. On the one hand, this kind of hierarchical decomposition well addresses the problem of object embedding and occlusions, which are widely observed in real scenarios. On the other hand, the non-leaf nodes and leaf nodes on the hierarchy correspond to the instance regions in different granularities within an image. Therefore, features in uniform length are produced for these instance regions, which may cover across a dominant image region, an integral of multiple instances, or various individual instances. Such a collection of features allows us to unify the image retrieval, multi-instance search, and instance search into one framework. The empirical studies on three benchmarks show that such an instance-level descriptor remains effective on both the known and unknown object categories. Moreover, the superior performance is achieved on single-instance and multi-instance search, as well as image retrieval tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[DTAA: A Detect, Track and Avoid Architecture for navigation in spaces with Multiple Velocity Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08121v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proactive collision avoidance measures are imperative in environments where humans and robots coexist. Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose Eyes on Target, a novel depth-aware and gaze-guided object detection framework designed for egocentric videos. Our approach injects gaze-derived features into the attention mechanism of a Vision Transformer (ViT), effectively biasing spatial feature selection toward human-attended regions. Unlike traditional object detectors that treat all regions equally, our method emphasises viewer-prioritised areas to enhance object detection. We validate our method on an egocentric simulator dataset where human visual attention is critical for task assessment, illustrating its potential in evaluating human performance in simulation scenarios. We evaluate the effectiveness of our gaze-integrated model through extensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating consistent gains in detection accuracy over gaze-agnostic baselines on both the custom simulator dataset and public benchmarks, including Ego4D Ego-Motion and Ego-CH-Gaze datasets. To interpret model behaviour, we also introduce a gaze-aware attention head importance metric, revealing how gaze cues modulate transformer attention dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at RAAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reflectance Prediction-based Knowledge Distillation for Robust 3D Object Detection in Compressed Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17442v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Regarding intelligent transportation systems, low-bitrate transmission via lossy point cloud compression is vital for facilitating real-time collaborative perception among connected agents, such as vehicles and infrastructures, under restricted bandwidth. In existing compression transmission systems, the sender lossily compresses point coordinates and reflectance to generate a transmission code stream, which faces transmission burdens from reflectance encoding and limited detection robustness due to information loss. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 3D object detection framework with reflectance prediction-based knowledge distillation (RPKD). We compress point coordinates while discarding reflectance during low-bitrate transmission, and feed the decoded non-reflectance compressed point clouds into a student detector. The discarded reflectance is then reconstructed by a geometry-based reflectance prediction (RP) module within the student detector for precise detection. A teacher detector with the same structure as the student detector is designed for performing reflectance knowledge distillation (RKD) and detection knowledge distillation (DKD) from raw to compressed point clouds. Our cross-source distillation training strategy (CDTS) equips the student detector with robustness to low-quality compressed data while preserving the accuracy benefits of raw data through transferred distillation knowledge. Experimental results on the KITTI and DAIR-V2X-V datasets demonstrate that our method can boost detection accuracy for compressed point clouds across multiple code rates. We will release the code publicly at https://github.com/HaoJing-SX/RPKD.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid YOLOv5-SSD IoT-Based Animal Detection System for Durian Plantation Protection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00777v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Durian plantation suffers from animal intrusions that cause crop damage and financial loss. The traditional farming practices prove ineffective due to the unavailability of monitoring without human intervention. The fast growth of machine learning and Internet of Things (IoT) technology has led to new ways to detect animals. However, current systems are limited by dependence on single object detection algorithms, less accessible notification platforms, and limited deterrent mechanisms. This research suggests an IoT-enabled animal detection system for durian crops. The system integrates YOLOv5 and SSD object detection algorithms to improve detection accuracy. The system provides real-time monitoring, with detected intrusions automatically reported to farmers via Telegram notifications for rapid response. An automated sound mechanism (e.g., tiger roar) is triggered once the animal is detected. The YOLO+SSD model achieved accuracy rates of elephant, boar, and monkey at 90%, 85% and 70%, respectively. The system shows the highest accuracy in daytime and decreases at night, regardless of whether the image is still or a video. Overall, this study contributes a comprehensive and practical framework that combines detection, notification, and deterrence, paving the way for future innovations in automated farming solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Space Object Detection using Multi-frame Temporal Trajectory Completion Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19220v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Space objects in Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) present significant detection challenges in optical imaging due to weak signals, complex stellar backgrounds, and environmental interference. In this paper, we enhance high-frequency features of GEO targets while suppressing background noise at the single-frame level through wavelet transform. Building on this, we propose a multi-frame temporal trajectory completion scheme centered on the Hungarian algorithm for globally optimal cross-frame matching. To effectively mitigate missing and false detections, a series of key steps including temporal matching and interpolation completion, temporal-consistency-based noise filtering, and progressive trajectory refinement are designed in the post-processing pipeline. Experimental results on the public SpotGEO dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, achieving an F_1 score of 90.14%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%).

Tusks seized by law enforcement officials carry forensic information on the traffickers responsible for their export, including DNA evidence and handwritten markings made by traffickers. For 20 years, analyses of tusk DNA have identified where elephants were poached and established connections among shipments of ivory. While the links established using genetic evidence are extremely conclusive, genetic data is expensive and sometimes impossible to obtain. But though handwritten markings are easy to photograph, they are rarely documented or analyzed. Here, we present an AI-driven pipeline for extracting and analyzing handwritten markings on seized elephant tusks, offering a novel, scalable, and low-cost source of forensic evidence. Having collected 6,085 photographs from eight large seizures of ivory over a 6-year period (2014-2019), we used an object detection model to extract over 17,000 individual markings, which were then labeled and described using state-of-the-art AI tools. We identified 184 recurring "signature markings" that connect the tusks on which they appear. 20 signature markings were observed in multiple seizures, establishing forensic links between these seizures through traffickers involved in both shipments. This work complements other investigative techniques by filling in gaps where other data sources are unavailable. The study demonstrates the transformative potential of AI in wildlife forensics and highlights practical steps for integrating handwriting analysis into efforts to disrupt organized wildlife crime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted. 5 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

However, their deployment in safety-critical applications is hindered by the inherent lack of reliability of neural networks and the complex structure of object detection models. To address these challenges, we turn to Conformal Prediction, a post-hoc predictive uncertainty quantification procedure with statistical guarantees that are valid for any dataset size, without requiring prior knowledge on the model or data distribution. Our contribution is manifold. First, we formally define the problem of Conformal Object Detection (COD). We introduce a novel method, Sequential Conformal Risk Control (SeqCRC), that extends the statistical guarantees of Conformal Risk Control to two sequential tasks with two parameters, as required in the COD setting. Then, we present old and new loss functions and prediction sets suited to applying SeqCRC to different cases and certification requirements. Finally, we present a conformal toolkit for replication and further exploration of our method. Using this toolkit, we perform extensive experiments that validate our approach and emphasize trade-offs and other practical consequences.</p></details> | 29 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Gaussian Combined Distance: A Generic Metric for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27649v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In object detection, a well-defined similarity metric can significantly enhance model performance. Currently, the IoU-based similarity metric is the most commonly preferred choice for detectors. However, detectors using IoU as a similarity metric often perform poorly when detecting small objects because of their sensitivity to minor positional deviations. To address this issue, recent studies have proposed the Wasserstein Distance as an alternative to IoU for measuring the similarity of Gaussian-distributed bounding boxes. However, we have observed that the Wasserstein Distance lacks scale invariance, which negatively impacts the model's generalization capability. Additionally, when used as a loss function, its independent optimization of the center attributes leads to slow model convergence and unsatisfactory detection precision. To address these challenges, we introduce the Gaussian Combined Distance (GCD). Through analytical examination of GCD and its gradient, we demonstrate that GCD not only possesses scale invariance but also facilitates joint optimization, which enhances model localization performance. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset for tiny object detection show that GCD, as a bounding box regression loss function and label assignment metric, achieves state-of-the-art performance across various detectors. We further validated the generalizability of GCD on the MS-COCO-2017 and Visdrone-2019 datasets, where it outperforms the Wasserstein Distance across diverse scales of datasets.

However, they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can cause incorrect predictions with small perturbations in input images. Addressing this issue is crucial for deploying robust deep-learning systems. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes contrastive learning for adversarial defense, a previously unexplored area. Our method leverages the contrastive loss function to enhance the robustness of classification models by training them with both clean and adversarially perturbed images. By optimizing the model's parameters alongside the perturbations, our approach enables the network to learn robust representations that are less susceptible to adversarial attacks. Experimental results show significant improvements in the model's robustness against various types of adversarial perturbations. This suggests that contrastive loss helps extract more informative and resilient features, contributing to the field of adversarial robustness in deep learning.</p></details> |  |

Fusing the these complementary modalities has great potential for cost-effective 3D perception. However, most existing camera-radar fusion methods are limited to single-frame inputs, capturing only a partial view of the scene. The incomplete scene information, compounded by image degradation and 4D radar sparsity, hinders overall detection performance. In contrast, multi-frame fusion offers richer spatiotemporal information but faces two challenges: achieving robust and effective object feature fusion across frames and modalities, and mitigating the computational cost of redundant feature extraction. Consequently, we propose M^3Detection, a unified multi-frame 3D object detection framework that performs multi-level feature fusion on multi-modal data from camera and 4D imaging radar. Our framework leverages intermediate features from the baseline detector and employs the tracker to produce reference trajectories, improving computational efficiency and providing richer information for second-stage. In the second stage, we design a global-level inter-object feature aggregation module guided by radar information to align global features across candidate proposals and a local-level inter-grid feature aggregation module that expands local features along the reference trajectories to enhance fine-grained object representation. The aggregated features are then processed by a trajectory-level multi-frame spatiotemporal reasoning module to encode cross-frame interactions and enhance temporal representation. Extensive experiments on the VoD and TJ4DRadSet datasets demonstrate that M^3Detection achieves state-of-the-art 3D detection performance, validating its effectiveness in multi-frame detection with camera-4D imaging radar fusion.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Generating Accurate and Detailed Captions for High-Resolution Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27164v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) often struggle to generate accurate and detailed captions for high-resolution images since they are typically pre-trained on low-resolution inputs (e.g., 224x224 or 336x336 pixels). Downscaling high-resolution images to these dimensions may result in the loss of visual details and the omission of important objects. To address this limitation, we propose a novel pipeline that integrates vision-language models, large language models (LLMs), and object detection systems to enhance caption quality. Our proposed pipeline refines captions through a novel, multi-stage process. Given a high-resolution image, an initial caption is first generated using a VLM, and key objects in the image are then identified by an LLM. The LLM predicts additional objects likely to co-occur with the identified key objects, and these predictions are verified by object detection systems. Newly detected objects not mentioned in the initial caption undergo focused, region-specific captioning to ensure they are incorporated. This process enriches caption detail while reducing hallucinations by removing references to undetected objects. We evaluate the enhanced captions using pairwise comparison and quantitative scoring from large multimodal models, along with a benchmark for hallucination detection. Experiments on a curated dataset of high-resolution images demonstrate that our pipeline produces more detailed and reliable image captions while effectively minimizing hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work conducted in 2024; released for archival purposes</p></details> |

We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3). Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead (21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil engineering datasets (<10K images) while preserving computational efficiency, providing practical solutions for construction safety monitoring and infrastructure inspection in data-constrained environments.</p></details> |  |

Remarkably, UniLION serves as a single versatile architecture that can seamlessly support multiple specialized variants (i.e., LiDAR-only, temporal LiDAR, multi-modal, and multi-modal temporal fusion configurations) without requiring explicit temporal or multi-modal fusion modules. Moreover, UniLION consistently delivers competitive and even state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of core tasks, including 3D perception (e.g., 3D object detection, 3D object tracking, 3D occupancy prediction, BEV map segmentation), prediction (e.g., motion prediction), and planning (e.g., end-to-end planning). This unified paradigm naturally simplifies the design of multi-modal and multi-task autonomous driving systems while maintaining superior performance. Ultimately, we hope UniLION offers a fresh perspective on the development of 3D foundation models in autonomous driving. Code is available at https://github.com/happinesslz/UniLION</p></details> |  |
| **[UniSOT: A Unified Framework for Multi-Modality Single Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01427v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single object tracking aims to localize target object with specific reference modalities (bounding box, natural language or both) in a sequence of specific video modalities (RGB, RGB+Depth, RGB+Thermal or RGB+Event.). Different reference modalities enable various human-machine interactions, and different video modalities are demanded in complex scenarios to enhance tracking robustness. Existing trackers are designed for single or several video modalities with single or several reference modalities, which leads to separate model designs and limits practical applications. Practically, a unified tracker is needed to handle various requirements. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no tracker that can perform tracking with these above reference modalities across these video modalities simultaneously. Thus, in this paper, we present a unified tracker, UniSOT, for different combinations of three reference modalities and four video modalities with uniform parameters. Extensive experimental results on 18 visual tracking, vision-language tracking and RGB+X tracking benchmarks demonstrate that UniSOT shows superior performance against modality-specific counterparts. Notably, UniSOT outperforms previous counterparts by over 3.0\% AUC on TNL2K across all three reference modalities and outperforms Un-Track by over 2.0\% main metric across all three RGB+X video modalities.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted by TPAMI</p></details> |

Moreover, the introduction of high quality legged robots into workplaces highlighted the crucial role of a robust, fully autonomous safety solution for robots to be viable in shared spaces or in co-existence with humans. This article establishes for the first time ever an innovative Detect-Track-and-Avoid Architecture (DTAA) to enhance safety and overall mission performance. The proposed novel architectyre has the merit ot integrating object detection using YOLOv8, utilizing Ultralytics embedded object tracking, and state estimation of tracked objects through Kalman filters. Moreover, a novel heuristic clustering is employed to facilitate active avoidance of multiple closely positioned objects with similar velocities, creating sets of unsafe spaces for the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) to navigate around. The NMPC identifies the most hazardous unsafe space, considering not only their current positions but also their predicted future locations. In the sequel, the NMPC calculates maneuvers to guide the robot along a path planned by D$^{*}_{+}$ towards its intended destination, while maintaining a safe distance to all identified obstacles. The efficacy of the novelly suggested DTAA framework is being validated by Real-life experiments featuring a Boston Dynamics Spot robot that demonstrates the robot's capability to consistently maintain a safe distance from humans in dynamic subterranean, urban indoor, and outdoor environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniTrack++: Omnidirectional Multi-Object Tracking by Learning Large-FoV Trajectory Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00510v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) in panoramic imagery, which introduces unique challenges including a 360{\deg} Field of View (FoV), resolution dilution, and severe view-dependent distortions. Conventional MOT methods designed for narrow-FoV pinhole cameras generalize unsatisfactorily under these conditions. To address panoramic distortion, large search space, and identity ambiguity under a 360{\deg} FoV, OmniTrack++ adopts a feedback-driven framework that progressively refines perception with trajectory cues. A DynamicSSM block first stabilizes panoramic features, implicitly alleviating geometric distortion. On top of normalized representations, FlexiTrack Instances use trajectory-informed feedback for flexible localization and reliable short-term association. To ensure long-term robustness, an ExpertTrack Memory consolidates appearance cues via a Mixture-of-Experts design, enabling recovery from fragmented tracks and reducing identity drift. Finally, a Tracklet Management module adaptively switches between end-to-end and tracking-by-detection modes according to scene dynamics, offering a balanced and scalable solution for panoramic MOT. To support rigorous evaluation, we establish the EmboTrack benchmark, a comprehensive dataset for panoramic MOT that includes QuadTrack, captured with a quadruped robot, and BipTrack, collected with a bipedal wheel-legged robot. Together, these datasets span wide-angle environments and diverse motion patterns, providing a challenging testbed for real-world panoramic perception. Extensive experiments on JRDB and EmboTrack demonstrate that OmniTrack++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, yielding substantial HOTA improvements of +25.5% on JRDB and +43.07% on QuadTrack over the original OmniTrack.

| **[Lattice Boltzmann Model for Learning Real-World Pixel Dynamicity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16527v2)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to learn real-world pixel dynamicity for visual tracking. LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%). We will release our code soon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is submitted to the IEEE Transactions</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behaviour classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviours such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioural analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Approach for Visual Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24410v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers.

Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art trackers, with integrated implementations of baselines for fair comparison.

| **[Bootstrapping Referring Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05039v2)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring understanding is a fundamental task that bridges natural language and visual content by localizing objects described in free-form expressions. However, existing works are constrained by limited language expressiveness, lacking the capacity to model object dynamics in spatial numbers and temporal states. To address these limitations, we introduce a new and general referring understanding task, termed referring multi-object tracking (RMOT). Its core idea is to employ a language expression as a semantic cue to guide the prediction of multi-object tracking, comprehensively accounting for variations in object quantity and temporal semantics. Along with RMOT, we introduce a RMOT benchmark named Refer-KITTI-V2, featuring scalable and diverse language expressions. To efficiently generate high-quality annotations covering object dynamics with minimal manual effort, we propose a semi-automatic labeling pipeline that formulates a total of 9,758 language prompts. In addition, we propose TempRMOT, an elegant end-to-end Transformer-based framework for RMOT. At its core is a query-driven Temporal Enhancement Module that represents each object as a Transformer query, enabling long-term spatial-temporal interactions with other objects and past frames to efficiently refine these queries. TempRMOT achieves state-of-the-art performance on both Refer-KITTI and Refer-KITTI-V2, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.

| **[PlanarTrack: A high-quality and challenging benchmark for large-scale planar object tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23368v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short- and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations, each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at https://github.com/HengLan/PlanarTrack</p></details> |  |

Our novel graph-weighted solution updates a person's identification label online based on tracks and the person's characteristic features. To find the best solution, we deeply investigated all elements of the MOT process, including feature extraction, tracking, and community search. Furthermore, GRAP-MOT is equipped with a person's position estimation module, which gives additional key information to the MOT method, ensuring better results than methods without position data. We tested GRAP-MOT on recordings acquired in a closed-area model and on publicly available real datasets that fulfil the requirement of a highly congested space, showing the superiority of our proposition. Finally, we analyzed existing metrics used to compare MOT algorithms and concluded that IDF1 is more adequate than MOTA in such comparisons. We made our code, along with the acquired dataset, publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models, and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter efficient, and interpretable approach.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |

Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAD: Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation to Bridge Spatio-Temporal Gaps in Event-Based Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19560v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB cameras excel at capturing rich texture details with high spatial resolution, whereas event cameras offer exceptional temporal resolution and a high dynamic range (HDR). Leveraging their complementary strengths can substantially enhance object tracking under challenging conditions, such as high-speed motion, HDR environments, and dynamic background interference. However, a significant spatio-temporal asymmetry exists between these two modalities due to their fundamentally different imaging mechanisms, hindering effective multi-modal integration. To address this issue, we propose {Hierarchical Asymmetric Distillation} (HAD), a multi-modal knowledge distillation framework that explicitly models and mitigates spatio-temporal asymmetries. Specifically, HAD proposes a hierarchical alignment strategy that minimizes information loss while maintaining the student network's computational efficiency and parameter compactness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, and comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness and necessity of each designed component. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Attacks on LiDAR-Based Tracking Across Road Users: Robustness Evaluation and Target-Aware Black-Box Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20893v3)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we delve into the robustness of neural network-based LiDAR point cloud tracking models under adversarial attacks, a critical aspect often overlooked in favor of performance enhancement. These models, despite incorporating advanced architectures like Transformer or Bird's Eye View (BEV), tend to neglect robustness in the face of challenges such as adversarial attacks, domain shifts, or data corruption. We instead focus on the robustness of the tracking models under the threat of adversarial attacks. We begin by establishing a unified framework for conducting adversarial attacks within the context of 3D object tracking, which allows us to thoroughly investigate both white-box and black-box attack strategies. For white-box attacks, we tailor specific loss functions to accommodate various tracking paradigms and extend existing methods such as FGSM, C\&W, and PGD to the point cloud domain. In addressing black-box attack scenarios, we introduce a novel transfer-based approach, the Target-aware Perturbation Generation (TAPG) algorithm, with the dual objectives of achieving high attack performance and maintaining low perceptibility. This method employs a heuristic strategy to enforce sparse attack constraints and utilizes random sub-vector factorization to bolster transferability. Our experimental findings reveal a significant vulnerability in advanced tracking methods when subjected to both black-box and white-box attacks, underscoring the necessity for incorporating robustness against adversarial attacks into the design of LiDAR point cloud tracking models. Notably, compared to existing methods, the TAPG also strikes an optimal balance between the effectiveness of the attack and the concealment of the perturbations.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniHPR: Unified Human Pose Representation via Singular Value Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19078v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing interest in developing effective alignment pipelines to generate unified representations from different modalities for multi-modal fusion and generation. As an important component of Human-Centric applications, Human Pose representations are critical in many downstream tasks, such as Human Pose Estimation, Action Recognition, Human-Computer Interaction, Object tracking, etc. Human Pose representations or embeddings can be extracted from images, 2D keypoints, 3D skeletons, mesh models, and lots of other modalities. Yet, there are limited instances where the correlation among all of those representations has been clearly researched using a contrastive paradigm. In this paper, we propose UniHPR, a unified Human Pose Representation learning pipeline, which aligns Human Pose embeddings from images, 2D and 3D human poses. To align more than two data representations at the same time, we propose a novel singular value-based contrastive learning loss, which better aligns different modalities and further boosts performance. To evaluate the effectiveness of the aligned representation, we choose 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation (HPE) as our evaluation tasks. In our evaluation, with a simple 3D human pose decoder, UniHPR achieves remarkable performance metrics: MPJPE 49.9mm on the Human3.6M dataset and PA-MPJPE 51.6mm on the 3DPW dataset with cross-domain evaluation. Meanwhile, we are able to achieve 2D and 3D pose retrieval with our unified human pose representations in Human3.6M dataset, where the retrieval error is 9.24mm in MPJPE.</p></details> |  |

The system leverages YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall. To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and stable management.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

These issues are further exacerbated by abrupt UAV movements, leading to unreliable trajectory estimation and identity switches. Conventional motion models, such as Kalman filters or static sequence encoders, often fall short in capturing both linear and non-linear dynamics under such conditions. To tackle these limitations, we propose DMTrack, a deformable motion tracking framework tailored for UAV-based MOT. Our DMTrack introduces three key components: DeformMamba, a deformable state-space predictor that dynamically aggregates historical motion states for adaptive trajectory modeling; MotionGate, a lightweight gating module that fuses Kalman and Mamba predictions based on motion context and uncertainty; and an uncertainty-aware association strategy that enhances identity preservation by aligning motion trends with prediction confidence. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone-MOT and UAVDT benchmarks demonstrate that our DMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance in identity consistency and tracking accuracy, particularly under high-speed and non-linear motion. Importantly, our method operates without appearance models and maintains competitive efficiency, highlighting its practicality for robust UAV-based tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[EPIPTrack: Rethinking Prompt Modeling with Explicit and Implicit Prompts for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13235v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal semantic cues, such as textual descriptions, have shown strong potential in enhancing target perception for tracking. However, existing methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment. Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust adaptability and superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT.</p></details> |  |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |

| **[CASteer: Steering Diffusion Models for Controllable Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09630v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have transformed image generation, yet controlling their outputs to reliably erase undesired concepts remains challenging. Existing approaches usually require task-specific training and struggle to generalize across both concrete (e.g., objects) and abstract (e.g., styles) concepts. We propose CASteer (Cross-Attention Steering), a training-free framework for concept erasure in diffusion models using steering vectors to influence hidden representations dynamically. CASteer precomputes concept-specific steering vectors by averaging neural activations from images generated for each target concept. During inference, it dynamically applies these vectors to suppress undesired concepts only when they appear, ensuring that unrelated regions remain unaffected. This selective activation enables precise, context-aware erasure without degrading overall image quality. This approach achieves effective removal of harmful or unwanted content across a wide range of visual concepts, all without model retraining. CASteer outperforms state-of-the-art concept erasure techniques while preserving unrelated content and minimizing unintended effects. Pseudocode is provided in the supplementary.</p></details> |  |

At its core is a speech information bottleneck (SIB) module, which compresses raw speech into compact semantic tokens, preserving prosody and emotional nuance. By operating directly on these tokens, VoxStudio eliminates the need for an additional speech-to-text system, which often ignores the hidden details beyond text, e.g., tone or emotion. We also release VoxEmoset, a large-scale paired emotional speech-image dataset built via an advanced TTS engine to affordably generate richly expressive utterances. Comprehensive experiments on the SpokenCOCO, Flickr8kAudio, and VoxEmoset benchmarks demonstrate the feasibility of our method and highlight key challenges, including emotional consistency and linguistic ambiguity, paving the way for future research.</p></details> | In progress |
| **[Finetuning-Free Personalization of Text to Image Generation via Hypernetworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03156v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Personalizing text-to-image diffusion models has traditionally relied on subject-specific fine-tuning approaches such as DreamBooth~\cite{ruiz2023dreambooth}, which are computationally expensive and slow at inference. Recent adapter- and encoder-based methods attempt to reduce this overhead but still depend on additional fine-tuning or large backbone models for satisfactory results. In this work, we revisit an orthogonal direction: fine-tuning-free personalization via Hypernetworks that predict LoRA-adapted weights directly from subject images. Prior hypernetwork-based approaches, however, suffer from costly data generation or unstable attempts to mimic base model optimization trajectories. We address these limitations with an end-to-end training objective, stabilized by a simple output regularization, yielding reliable and effective hypernetworks. Our method removes the need for per-subject optimization at test time while preserving both subject fidelity and prompt alignment. To further enhance compositional generalization at inference time, we introduce Hybrid-Model Classifier-Free Guidance (HM-CFG), which combines the compositional strengths of the base diffusion model with the subject fidelity of personalized models during sampling. Extensive experiments on CelebA-HQ, AFHQ-v2, and DreamBench demonstrate that our approach achieves strong personalization performance and highlights the promise of hypernetworks as a scalable and effective direction for open-category personalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Erasing 'Ugly' from the Internet: Propagation of the Beauty Myth in Text-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00749v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social media has exacerbated the promotion of Western beauty norms, leading to negative self-image, particularly in women and girls, and causing harm such as body dysmorphia. Increasingly content on the internet has been artificially generated, leading to concerns that these norms are being exaggerated. The aim of this work is to study how generative AI models may encode 'beauty' and erase 'ugliness', and discuss the implications of this for society. To investigate these aims, we create two image generation pipelines: a text-to-image model and a text-to-language model-to image model. We develop a structured beauty taxonomy which we use to prompt three language models (LMs) and two text-to-image models to cumulatively generate 5984 images using our two pipelines. We then recruit women and non-binary social media users to evaluate 1200 of the images through a Likert-scale within-subjects study. Participants show high agreement in their ratings. Our results show that 86.5% of generated images depicted people with lighter skin tones, 22% contained explicit content despite Safe for Work (SFW) training, and 74% were rated as being in a younger age demographic. In particular, the images of non-binary individuals were rated as both younger and more hypersexualised, indicating troubling intersectional effects. Notably, prompts encoded with 'negative' or 'ugly' beauty traits (such as "a wide nose") consistently produced higher Not SFW (NSFW) ratings regardless of gender. This work sheds light on the pervasive demographic biases related to beauty standards present in generative AI models -- biases that are actively perpetuated by model developers, such as via negative prompting. We conclude by discussing the implications of this on society, which include pollution of the data streams and active erasure of features that do not fall inside the stereotype of what is considered beautiful by developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint under review</p></details> |
| **[Inference-Time Personalized Alignment with a Few User Preference Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02966v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of aligning a generative model's response with a user's preferences. Recent works have proposed several different formulations for personalized alignment; however, they either require a large amount of user preference queries or require that the preference be explicitly specified as a text input. In this paper, we propose a novel inference-time personalized alignment method, UserAlign, that elicits the user's preferences with a few queries as pairwise response comparisons. In particular, UserAlign builds on the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the best response quickly. Experimental results across several tasks, involving personalized text and image generation, showcase the effectiveness of UserAlign in achieving personalized alignment.</p></details> | NeurIPS'25 paper |

We trace these limitations to a myopic view of the denoising trajectories that govern diffusion based generation. We introduce EraseFlow, the first framework that casts concept unlearning as exploration in the space of denoising paths and optimizes it with GFlowNets equipped with the trajectory balance objective. By sampling entire trajectories rather than single end states, EraseFlow learns a stochastic policy that steers generation away from target concepts while preserving the model's prior. EraseFlow eliminates the need for carefully crafted reward models and by doing this, it generalizes effectively to unseen concepts and avoids hackable rewards while improving the performance. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that EraseFlow outperforms existing baselines and achieves an optimal trade off between performance and prior preservation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS'25 Spotlight | Project page: https://eraseflow.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[A Practical Investigation of Spatially-Controlled Image Generation with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15724v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling image generation models to be spatially controlled is an important area of research, empowering users to better generate images according to their own fine-grained specifications via e.g. edge maps, poses. Although this task has seen impressive improvements in recent times, a focus on rapidly producing stronger models has come at the cost of detailed and fair scientific comparison. Differing training data, model architectures and generation paradigms make it difficult to disentangle the factors contributing to performance. Meanwhile, the motivations and nuances of certain approaches become lost in the literature. In this work, we aim to provide clear takeaways across generation paradigms for practitioners wishing to develop transformer-based systems for spatially-controlled generation, clarifying the literature and addressing knowledge gaps. We perform controlled experiments on ImageNet across diffusion-based/flow-based and autoregressive (AR) models. First, we establish control token prefilling as a simple, general and performant baseline approach for transformers. We then investigate previously underexplored sampling time enhancements, showing that extending classifier-free guidance to control, as well as softmax truncation, have a strong impact on control-generation consistency. Finally, we re-clarify the motivation of adapter-based approaches, demonstrating that they mitigate "forgetting" and maintain generation quality when trained on limited downstream data, but underperform full training in terms of generation-control consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>TMLR ...</summary><p>TMLR https://openreview.net/forum?id=loT6xhgLYK</p></details> |

Existing solutions either rely on fine-tuning with large, inaccessible datasets or are training-free yet limited to generating isolated foreground elements, failing to produce a complete and coherent scene. To address this, we introduce the Training-free Noise Transplantation and Cultivation Diffusion Model (TAUE), a novel framework for zero-shot, layer-wise image generation. Our core technique, Noise Transplantation and Cultivation (NTC), extracts intermediate latent representations from both foreground and composite generation processes, transplanting them into the initial noise for subsequent layers. This ensures semantic and structural coherence across foreground, background, and composite layers, enabling consistent, multi-layered outputs without requiring fine-tuning or auxiliary datasets. Extensive experiments show that our training-free method achieves performance comparable to fine-tuned methods, enhancing layer-wise consistency while maintaining high image quality and fidelity. TAUE not only eliminates costly training and dataset requirements but also unlocks novel downstream applications, such as complex compositional editing, paving the way for more accessible and controllable generative workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables.

This work provides concrete guidelines for future IMAX architectural designs and establishes a foundation for developing next-generation, AI-specialized Coarse-Grained Linear Array (CGLA) accelerators by refining this versatile platform.

However, applying these models to the fire domain remains challenging due to the lack of publicly available datasets with high-quality fire domain annotations. To address this gap, we introduce DetectiumFire, a large-scale, multi-modal dataset comprising of 22.5k high-resolution fire-related images and 2.5k real-world fire-related videos covering a wide range of fire types, environments, and risk levels. The data are annotated with both traditional computer vision labels (e.g., bounding boxes) and detailed textual prompts describing the scene, enabling applications such as synthetic data generation and fire risk reasoning. DetectiumFire offers clear advantages over existing benchmarks in scale, diversity, and data quality, significantly reducing redundancy and enhancing coverage of real-world scenarios. We validate the utility of DetectiumFire across multiple tasks, including object detection, diffusion-based image generation, and vision-language reasoning. Our results highlight the potential of this dataset to advance fire-related research and support the development of intelligent safety systems. We release DetectiumFire to promote broader exploration of fire understanding in the AI community.

However, training deep learning models requires large annotated datasets, which are costly to obtain in real fields. Synthetic data can reduce this burden, but the gap between simulated and real images remains a challenge. In this paper, we present a pipeline for procedural generation of synthetic crop-weed images using Blender, producing annotated datasets under diverse conditions of plant growth, weed density, lighting, and camera angle. We benchmark several state-of-the-art segmentation models on synthetic and real datasets and analyze their cross-domain generalization. Our results show that training on synthetic images leads to a sim-to-real gap of 10%, surpassing previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, synthetic data demonstrates good generalization properties, outperforming real datasets in cross-domain scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of synthetic agricultural datasets and support hybrid strategies for more efficient model training.</p></details> |  |

Previous works primarily rely on additional simulator data or web-collected images/videos to improve the generalization. However, the simulator environments still face limited diversity, and the web-collected data often requires extensive labor to remove the noise. In this paper, we propose a Rewriting-driven AugMentation (RAM) paradigm for VLN, which directly creates the unseen observation-instruction pairs via rewriting human-annotated training data. Benefiting from our rewriting mechanism, new observation-instruction pairs can be obtained in both simulator-free and labor-saving manners to promote generalization. Specifically, we first introduce Object-Enriched Observation Rewriting, where we combine Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to derive rewritten object-enriched scene descriptions, enabling observation synthesis with diverse objects and spatial layouts via Text-to-Image Generation Models (T2IMs). Then, we propose Observation-Contrast Instruction Rewriting, which generates observation-aligned rewritten instructions by requiring LLMs to reason the difference between original and new observations. We further develop a mixing-then-focusing training strategy with a random observation cropping scheme, effectively enhancing data distribution diversity while suppressing augmentation data noise during training. Experiments on both the discrete environments (R2R, REVERIE, and R4R datasets) and continuous environments (R2R-CE dataset) show the superior performance and impressive generalization ability of our method.

Despite some DWT-based methods improving SR by capturing fine-grained frequency signals, most existing approaches neglect the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, resulting in inconsistencies and unnatural artifacts in the reconstructed images. To address this challenge, we propose a Diffusion Transformer model based on image Wavelet spectra for SR (DTWSR). DTWSR incorporates the superiority of diffusion models and transformers to capture the interrelations among multiscale frequency sub-bands, leading to a more consistence and realistic SR image. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose images into wavelet spectra. A pyramid tokenization method is proposed which embeds the spectra into a sequence of tokens for transformer model, facilitating to capture features from both spatial and frequency domain. A dual-decoder is designed elaborately to handle the distinct variances in low-frequency and high-frequency sub-bands, without omitting their alignment in image generation. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, with high performance on both perception quality and fidelity.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 Oral Paper |
| **[Structured Cognitive Loop for Behavioral Intelligence in Large Language Model Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05107v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have advanced natural language understanding and generation, but their use as autonomous agents introduces architectural challenges for multi-step tasks. Existing frameworks often mix cognition, memory, and control in a single prompt, reducing coherence and predictability. The Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) is proposed as an alternative architecture that separates these functions. In SCL, the language model handles cognition, memory is stored externally, and execution is guided by a lightweight controller within a goal-directed loop. This design allows intermediate results to be recorded and verified before actions are taken, improving traceability and evaluation. SCL is evaluated against prompt-based baselines such as ReAct and LangChain agents across three tasks: travel planning, conditional email drafting, and constraint-guided image generation. Under matched settings, SCL achieves an average task success rate of 86.3 percent, compared with 70.5 to 76.8 percent for baselines. It also shows higher goal fidelity, fewer redundant calls, and reduced unsupported assertions. These results indicate that separating cognition, memory, and control can enhance reliability and interpretability without relying on larger models or heavier prompts. The findings should be regarded as preliminary evidence, with broader tests across model families and task domains planned for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>The r...</summary><p>The revisions included clarifying that this work is a preliminary study in the Abstract, improving the readability of figures, and adding emphasis on the role of the meta-prompt in the system's architecture and hallucination control</p></details> |

In this paper, we ask: Can a unified principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN) as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images, text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently (representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously (joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders, LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available at https://github.com/microsoft/latent-zoning-networks.

Classical generative models typically demand extensive computational and sample resources. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative, but existing quantum-based image generation methods remain limited in scale and often face barren plateaus. We present MediQ-GAN, a quantum-inspired GAN with prototype-guided skip connections and a dual-stream generator that fuses classical and quantum-inspired branches. Its variational quantum circuits inherently preserve full-rank mappings, avoid rank collapse, and are theory-guided to balance expressivity with trainability. Beyond generation quality, we provide the first latent-geometry and rank-based analysis of quantum-inspired GANs, offering theoretical insight into their performance. Across three medical imaging datasets, MediQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GANs and diffusion models. While validated on IBM hardware for robustness, our contribution is hardware-agnostic, offering a scalable and data-efficient framework for medical image generation and augmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Diffusion VLA: Vision-Language-Action Model via Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01718v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models aim to understand natural language instructions and visual observations and to execute corresponding actions as an embodied agent. Recent work integrates future images into the understanding-acting loop, yielding unified VLAs that jointly understand, generate, and act -- reading text and images and producing future images and actions. However, these models either rely on external experts for modality unification or treat image generation and action prediction as separate processes, limiting the benefits of direct synergy between these tasks. Our core philosophy is to optimize generation and action jointly through a synchronous denoising process, where the iterative refinement enables actions to evolve from initialization, under constant and sufficient visual guidance. We ground this philosophy in our proposed Unified Diffusion VLA and Joint Discrete Denoising Diffusion Process (JD3P), which is a joint diffusion process that integrates multiple modalities into a single denoising trajectory to serve as the key mechanism enabling understanding, generation, and acting to be intrinsically synergistic. Our model and theory are built on a unified tokenized space of all modalities and a hybrid attention mechanism. We further propose a two-stage training pipeline and several inference-time techniques that optimize performance and efficiency. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks such as CALVIN, LIBERO, and SimplerEnv with 4$\times$ faster inference than autoregressive methods, and we demonstrate its effectiveness through in-depth analysis and real-world evaluations.

To address this limitation while preserving the advantages of range-view representations, such as computational efficiency and simplified network design, we propose Spiral, a novel range-view LiDAR diffusion model that simultaneously generates depth, reflectance images, and semantic maps. Furthermore, we introduce novel semantic-aware metrics to evaluate the quality of the generated labeled range-view data. Experiments on the SemanticKITTI and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that Spiral achieves state-of-the-art performance with the smallest parameter size, outperforming two-step methods that combine the generative and segmentation models. Additionally, we validate that range images generated by Spiral can be effectively used for synthetic data augmentation in the downstream segmentation training, significantly reducing the labeling effort on LiDAR data.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 24 pages, 10 figures, 9 tables; Code at https://dekai21.github.io/SPIRAL/</p></details> |
| **[NSYNC: Negative Synthetic Image Generation for Contrastive Training to Improve Stylized Text-To-Image Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01517v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current text conditioned image generation methods output realistic looking images, but they fail to capture specific styles. Simply finetuning them on the target style datasets still struggles to grasp the style features. In this work, we present a novel contrastive learning framework to improve the stylization capability of large text-to-image diffusion models. Motivated by the astonishing advance in image generation models that makes synthetic data an intrinsic part of model training in various computer vision tasks, we exploit synthetic image generation in our approach. Usually, the generated synthetic data is dependent on the task, and most of the time it is used to enlarge the available real training dataset. With NSYNC, alternatively, we focus on generating negative synthetic sets to be used in a novel contrastive training scheme along with real positive images. In our proposed training setup, we forward negative data along with positive data and obtain negative and positive gradients, respectively. We then refine the positive gradient by subtracting its projection onto the negative gradient to get the orthogonal component, based on which the parameters are updated. This orthogonal component eliminates the trivial attributes that are present in both positive and negative data and directs the model towards capturing a more unique style. Experiments on various styles of painters and illustrators show that our approach improves the performance over the baseline methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our code is available at https://github.com/giddyyupp/NSYNC.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Differentiable Generalized Sliced Wasserstein Plans](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22049v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal Transport (OT) has attracted significant interest in the machine learning community, not only for its ability to define meaningful distances between probability distributions -- such as the Wasserstein distance -- but also for its formulation of OT plans. Its computational complexity remains a bottleneck, though, and slicing techniques have been developed to scale OT to large datasets. Recently, a novel slicing scheme, dubbed min-SWGG, lifts a single one-dimensional plan back to the original multidimensional space, finally selecting the slice that yields the lowest Wasserstein distance as an approximation of the full OT plan. Despite its computational and theoretical advantages, min-SWGG inherits typical limitations of slicing methods: (i) the number of required slices grows exponentially with the data dimension, and (ii) it is constrained to linear projections. Here, we reformulate min-SWGG as a bilevel optimization problem and propose a differentiable approximation scheme to efficiently identify the optimal slice, even in high-dimensional settings. We furthermore define its generalized extension for accommodating to data living on manifolds. Finally, we demonstrate the practical value of our approach in various applications, including gradient flows on manifolds and high-dimensional spaces, as well as a novel sliced OT-based conditional flow matching for image generation -- where fast computation of transport plans is essential.</p></details> | <details><summary>LC an...</summary><p>LC and RT have equal contribution</p></details> |
| **[FIRE: Robust Detection of Diffusion-Generated Images via Frequency-Guided Reconstruction Error](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07140v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of diffusion models has significantly improved high-quality image generation, making generated content increasingly challenging to distinguish from real images and raising concerns about potential misuse. In this paper, we observe that diffusion models struggle to accurately reconstruct mid-band frequency information in real images, suggesting the limitation could serve as a cue for detecting diffusion model generated images. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel method called Frequency-guided Reconstruction Error (FIRE), which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to investigate the influence of frequency decomposition on reconstruction error. FIRE assesses the variation in reconstruction error before and after the frequency decomposition, offering a robust method for identifying diffusion model generated images. Extensive experiments show that FIRE generalizes effectively to unseen diffusion models and maintains robustness against diverse perturbations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 14 figures.

| **[TextAtlas5M: A Large-scale Dataset for Dense Text Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07870v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-conditioned image generation has gained significant attention in recent years and are processing increasingly longer and comprehensive text prompt. In everyday life, dense and intricate text appears in contexts like advertisements, infographics, and signage, where the integration of both text and visuals is essential for conveying complex information. However, despite these advances, the generation of images containing long-form text remains a persistent challenge, largely due to the limitations of existing datasets, which often focus on shorter and simpler text. To address this gap, we introduce TextAtlas5M, a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate long-text rendering in text-conditioned image generation. Our dataset consists of 5 million long-text generated and collected images across diverse data types, enabling comprehensive evaluation of large-scale generative models on long-text image generation. We further curate 3000 human-improved test set TextAtlasEval across 3 data domains, establishing one of the most extensive benchmarks for text-conditioned generation. Evaluations suggest that the TextAtlasEval benchmarks present significant challenges even for the most advanced proprietary models (e.g. GPT4o with DallE-3), while their open-source counterparts show an even larger performance gap. These evidences position TextAtlas5M as a valuable dataset for training and evaluating future-generation text-conditioned image generation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 15 figures.

| **[SmartFreeEdit: Mask-Free Spatial-Aware Image Editing with Complex Instruction Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12704v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image editing have utilized large-scale multimodal models to enable intuitive, natural instruction-driven interactions. However, conventional methods still face significant challenges, particularly in spatial reasoning, precise region segmentation, and maintaining semantic consistency, especially in complex scenes. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SmartFreeEdit, a novel end-to-end framework that integrates a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a hypergraph-enhanced inpainting architecture, enabling precise, mask-free image editing guided exclusively by natural language instructions. The key innovations of SmartFreeEdit include:(1)the introduction of region aware tokens and a mask embedding paradigm that enhance the spatial understanding of complex scenes;(2) a reasoning segmentation pipeline designed to optimize the generation of editing masks based on natural language instructions;and (3) a hypergraph-augmented inpainting module that ensures the preservation of both structural integrity and semantic coherence during complex edits, overcoming the limitations of local-based image generation. Extensive experiments on the Reason-Edit benchmark demonstrate that SmartFreeEdit surpasses current state-of-the-art methods across multiple evaluation metrics, including segmentation accuracy, instruction adherence, and visual quality preservation, while addressing the issue of local information focus and improving global consistency in the edited image. Our project will be available at https://github.com/smileformylove/SmartFreeEdit.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Attention Fails: A Taxonomy of Faults in Attention-Based Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04925v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention mechanisms are at the core of modern neural architectures, powering systems ranging from ChatGPT to autonomous vehicles and driving a major economic impact. However, high-profile failures, such as ChatGPT's nonsensical outputs or Google's suspension of Gemini's image generation due to attention weight errors, highlight a critical gap: existing deep learning fault taxonomies might not adequately capture the unique failures introduced by attention mechanisms. This gap leaves practitioners without actionable diagnostic guidance. To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive empirical study of faults in attention-based neural networks (ABNNs). Our work is based on a systematic analysis of 555 real-world faults collected from 96 projects across ten frameworks, including GitHub, Hugging Face, and Stack Overflow. Through our analysis, we develop a novel taxonomy comprising seven attention-specific fault categories, not captured by existing work. Our results show that over half of the ABNN faults arise from mechanisms unique to attention architectures. We further analyze the root causes and manifestations of these faults through various symptoms. Finally, by analyzing symptom-root cause associations, we identify four evidence-based diagnostic heuristics that explain 33.0% of attention-specific faults, offering the first systematic diagnostic guidance for attention-based models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deciphering Personalization: Towards Fine-Grained Explainability in Natural Language for Personalized Image Generation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01932v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image generation models are usually personalized in practical uses in order to better meet the individual users' heterogeneous needs, but most personalized models lack explainability about how they are being personalized. Such explainability can be provided via visual features in generated images, but is difficult for human users to understand. Explainability in natural language is a better choice, but the existing approaches to explainability in natural language are limited to be coarse-grained. They are unable to precisely identify the multiple aspects of personalization, as well as the varying levels of personalization in each aspect. To address such limitation, in this paper we present a new technique, namely \textbf{FineXL}, towards \textbf{Fine}-grained e\textbf{X}plainability in natural \textbf{L}anguage for personalized image generation models. FineXL can provide natural language descriptions about each distinct aspect of personalization, along with quantitative scores indicating the level of each aspect of personalization. Experiment results show that FineXL can improve the accuracy of explainability by 56\%, when different personalization scenarios are applied to multiple types of image generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Differential Vision Transformer: Learning Visual Contrasts via Pairwise Differentials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00833v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers (ViTs) have become a universal backbone for both image recognition and image generation. Yet their Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) layer still performs a quadratic query-key interaction for every token pair, spending the bulk of computation on visually weak or redundant correlations. We introduce Visual-Contrast Attention (VCA), a drop-in replacement for MHSA that injects an explicit notion of discrimination while reducing the theoretical complexity from O(N N C) to O(N n C) with n << N. VCA first distils each head's dense query field into a handful of spatially pooled visual-contrast tokens, then splits them into a learnable positive and negative stream whose differential interaction highlights what truly separates one region from another. The module adds fewer than 0.3M parameters to a DeiT-Tiny backbone, requires no extra FLOPs, and is wholly architecture-agnostic. Empirically, VCA lifts DeiT-Tiny top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K from 72.2% to 75.6% (+3.4) and improves three strong hierarchical ViTs by up to 3.1%, while in class-conditional ImageNet generation it lowers FID-50K by 2.1 to 5.2 points across both diffusion (DiT) and flow (SiT) models. Extensive ablations confirm that (i) spatial pooling supplies low-variance global cues, (ii) dual positional embeddings are indispensable for contrastive reasoning, and (iii) combining the two in both stages yields the strongest synergy. VCA therefore offers a simple path towards faster and sharper Vision Transformers. The source code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/LinearDiff.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[EDITOR: Effective and Interpretable Prompt Inversion for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03067v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation models~(e.g., Stable Diffusion) have achieved significant advancements, enabling the creation of high-quality and realistic images based on textual descriptions. Prompt inversion, the task of identifying the textual prompt used to generate a specific artifact, holds significant potential for applications including data attribution, model provenance, and watermarking validation. Recent studies introduced a delayed projection scheme to optimize for prompts representative of the vocabulary space, though challenges in semantic fluency and efficiency remain. Advanced image captioning models or visual large language models can generate highly interpretable prompts, but they often lack in image similarity. In this paper, we propose a prompt inversion technique called \sys for text-to-image diffusion models, which includes initializing embeddings using a pre-trained image captioning model, refining them through reverse-engineering in the latent space, and converting them to texts using an embedding-to-text model. Our experiments on the widely-used datasets, such as MS COCO, LAION, and Flickr, show that our method outperforms existing methods in terms of image similarity, textual alignment, prompt interpretability and generalizability. We further illustrate the application of our generated prompts in tasks such as cross-concept image synthesis, concept manipulation, evolutionary multi-concept generation and unsupervised segmentation.</p></details> |  |
