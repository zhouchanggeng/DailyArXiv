| **[Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07629v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5\% on AIME 2024, 83.2\% on AIME 2025, 66.0\% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1\% on LiveCodeBench V6.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing AI-Powered Medical Image Synthesis: Insights from MedVQA-GI Challenge Using CLIP, Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion, and Dream-Booth + LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20667v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The MEDVQA-GI challenge addresses the integration of AI-driven text-to-image generative models in medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance diagnostic capabilities through synthetic image generation. Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIPin: A Non-contrastive Plug-in to CLIP for Multimodal Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06434v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is available at https://github.com/T6Yang/CLIPin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bifrost-1: Bridging Multimodal LLMs and Diffusion Models with Patch-level CLIP Latents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05954v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is growing interest in integrating high-fidelity visual synthesis capabilities into large language models (LLMs) without compromising their strong reasoning capabilities. Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bifrost-1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification. We believe that our method underscores the effectiveness of multi-modal and multi-model fusion in tackling the multifaceted challenges of anomaly detection, providing a scalable solution for real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Viewpoint Consistency in 3D Generation via Attention and CLIP Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02287v3)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Emotion Recognition with Visual Prototypes: VEGA -- Revisiting CLIP in MERC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06564v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars. These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD. Code is available at: https://github.com/dkollias/VEGA.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication at ACM Multimedia (ACM MM) 2025</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-AGIQA: Boosting the Performance of AI-Generated Image Quality Assessment with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15098v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of generative technologies, AI-Generated Images (AIGIs) have been widely applied in various aspects of daily life. However, due to the immaturity of the technology, the quality of the generated images varies, so it is important to develop quality assessment techniques for the generated images. Although some models have been proposed to assess the quality of generated images, they are inadequate when faced with the ever-increasing and diverse categories of generated images. Consequently, the development of more advanced and effective models for evaluating the quality of generated images is urgently needed. Recent research has explored the significant potential of the visual language model CLIP in image quality assessment, finding that it performs well in evaluating the quality of natural images. However, its application to generated images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we build on this idea and further explore the potential of CLIP in evaluating the quality of generated images. We design CLIP-AGIQA, a CLIP-based regression model for quality assessment of generated images, leveraging rich visual and textual knowledge encapsulated in CLIP. Particularly, we implement multi-category learnable prompts to fully utilize the textual knowledge in CLIP for quality assessment. Extensive experiments on several generated image quality assessment benchmarks, including AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, demonstrate that CLIP-AGIQA outperforms existing IQA models, achieving excellent results in evaluating the quality of generated images.</p></details> | accepted by ICPR2024 |
| **[LeakyCLIP: Extracting Training Data from CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00756v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive Language--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of multimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scendi Score: Prompt-Aware Diversity Evaluation via Schur Complement of CLIP Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18645v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the fidelity of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts, which we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur Complement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware diversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the application of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several numerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate text-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models. Our numerical results indicate the success of the Scendi score in capturing the intrinsic diversity of prompt-guided generative models. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/scendi-score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Textual Semantic Priors for Knowledge Transfer and Refinement in CLIP-Driven Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01579v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored. During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation (SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier. Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[CLIP Brings Better Features to Visual Aesthetics Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15640v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its subjective nature and expensive manual annotations. Recent large-scale vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have shown their promising representation capability for various downstream tasks. However, the application of CLIP to resource-constrained and low-data IAA tasks remains limited. While few attempts to leverage CLIP in IAA have mainly focused on carefully designed prompts, we extend beyond this by allowing models from different domains and with different model sizes to acquire knowledge from CLIP. To achieve this, we propose a unified and flexible two-phase CLIP-based Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) paradigm, aiming to learn a lightweight IAA model while leveraging CLIP's strong generalization capability. Specifically, CSKD employs a feature alignment strategy to facilitate the distillation of heterogeneous CLIP teacher and IAA student models, effectively transferring valuable features from pre-trained visual representations to two lightweight IAA models, respectively. To efficiently adapt to downstream IAA tasks in a low-data regime, the two strong visual aesthetics learners then conduct distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge collaboratively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used IAA benchmarks. Furthermore, analysis of attention distance and entropy before and after feature alignment shows the effective transfer of CLIP's feature representation to IAA models, which not only provides valuable guidance for the model initialization of IAA but also enhances the aesthetic feature representation of IAA models. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | ICME 2025 Oral |
| **[NS-Net: Decoupling CLIP Semantic Information through NULL-Space for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01248v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[CorrCLIP: Reconstructing Patch Correlations in CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10086v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to assign semantic labels to each pixel without being constrained by a predefined set of categories. While Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) excels in zero-shot classification, it struggles to align image patches with category embeddings because of its incoherent patch correlations. This study reveals that inter-class correlations are the main reason for impairing CLIP's segmentation performance. Accordingly, we propose CorrCLIP, which reconstructs the scope and value of patch correlations. Specifically, CorrCLIP leverages the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to define the scope of patch interactions, reducing inter-class correlations. To mitigate the problem that SAM-generated masks may contain patches belonging to different classes, CorrCLIP incorporates self-supervised models to compute coherent similarity values, suppressing the weight of inter-class correlations. Additionally, we introduce two additional branches to strengthen patch features' spatial details and semantic representation. Finally, we update segmentation maps with SAM-generated masks to improve spatial consistency. Based on the improvement across patch correlations, feature representations, and segmentation maps, CorrCLIP achieves superior performance across eight benchmarks. Codes are available at: https://github.com/zdk258/CorrCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025 Oral</p></details> |
| **[Meta CLIP 2: A Worldwide Scaling Recipe](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22062v3)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) is a popular foundation model, supporting from zero-shot classification, retrieval to encoders for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Although CLIP is successfully trained on billion-scale image-text pairs from the English world, scaling CLIP's training further to learning from the worldwide web data is still challenging: (1) no curation method is available to handle data points from non-English world; (2) the English performance from existing multilingual CLIP is worse than its English-only counterpart, i.e., "curse of multilinguality" that is common in LLMs. Here, we present Meta CLIP 2, the first recipe training CLIP from scratch on worldwide web-scale image-text pairs. To generalize our findings, we conduct rigorous ablations with minimal changes that are necessary to address the above challenges and present a recipe enabling mutual benefits from English and non-English world data. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, Meta CLIP 2 ViT-H/14 surpasses its English-only counterpart by 0.8% and mSigLIP by 0.7%, and surprisingly sets new state-of-the-art without system-level confounding factors (e.g., translation, bespoke architecture changes) on multilingual benchmarks, such as CVQA with 57.4%, Babel-ImageNet with 50.2% and XM3600 with 64.3% on image-to-text retrieval.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[$\texttt{BATCLIP}$: Bimodal Online Test-Time Adaptation for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02837v3)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although open-vocabulary classification models like Contrastive Language Image Pretraining (CLIP) have demonstrated strong zero-shot learning capabilities, their robustness to common image corruptions remains poorly understood. Through extensive experiments, we show that zero-shot CLIP lacks robustness to common image corruptions during test-time, necessitating the adaptation of CLIP to unlabeled corrupted images using test-time adaptation (TTA). However, we found that existing TTA methods have severe limitations in adapting CLIP due to their unimodal nature. To address these limitations, we propose $\texttt{BATCLIP}$, a bimodal $\textbf{online}$ TTA method designed to improve CLIP's robustness to common image corruptions. The key insight of our approach is not only to adapt the visual encoders for improving image features but also to strengthen the alignment between image and text features by promoting a stronger association between the image class prototype, computed using pseudo-labels, and the corresponding text feature. We evaluate our approach on benchmark image corruption datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in online TTA for CLIP. Furthermore, we evaluate our proposed TTA approach on various domain generalization datasets to demonstrate its generalization capabilities. Our code is available at https://github.com/sarthaxxxxx/BATCLIP</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[Differentially Private Clipped-SGD: High-Probability Convergence with Arbitrary Clipping Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23512v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy guarantees.</p></details> | 60 pages |
| **[UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278v1)** | 2025-07-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose UniLIP, which extends CLIP to reconstruction, generation and editing, thereby building a unified tokenizer upon its exceptional comprehension capabilities. Previous CLIP-based unified methods often require additional diffusion decoders or quantization to support reconstruction and generation tasks, leading to inconsistent reconstruction or degradation of original comprehension performance.In contrast, we introduce a two-stage training scheme and a self-distillation strategy that progressively integrates reconstruction capabilities into CLIP, allowing it to maintain original comprehension performance while achieving effective image reconstruction. Furthermore, we propose a dual-condition architecture to connect the MLLM and diffusion transformer, using both learnable queries and the last layer multimodal hidden states as joint conditions. This method not only enables the utilization of the MLLM's strong reasoning capabilities in generation tasks, but also maximizes the exploitation of the rich information in UniLIP features during editing tasks. In text-to-image generation tasks, UniLIP obtains scores of 0.87 and 0.53 on GenEval and WISE benchmark respectively, surpassing all previous unified models of similar scale. In image editing, UniLIP also achieves a score of 3.62 on the ImgEdit Benchmark, surpassing recent state-of-the-art models such as BAGEL and UniWorld-V1. UniLIP effectively expand the application scope of CLIP, enabling continuous CLIP features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing Vision-based Human Action Recognition: Exploring Vision-Language CLIP Model for Generalisation in Domain-Independent Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18675v2)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human action recognition plays a critical role in healthcare and medicine, supporting applications such as patient behavior monitoring, fall detection, surgical robot supervision, and procedural skill assessment. While traditional models like CNNs and RNNs have achieved moderate success, they often struggle to generalize across diverse and complex actions. Recent advancements in vision-language models, especially the transformer-based CLIP model, offer promising capabilities for generalizing action recognition from video data. In this work, we evaluate CLIP on the UCF-101 dataset and systematically analyze its performance under three masking strategies: (1) percentage-based and shape-based black masking at 10%, 30%, and 50%, (2) feature-specific masking to suppress bias-inducing elements, and (3) isolation masking that retains only class-specific regions. Our results reveal that CLIP exhibits inconsistent behavior and frequent misclassifications, particularly when essential visual cues are obscured. To overcome these limitations, we propose incorporating class-specific noise, learned via a custom loss function, to reinforce attention to class-defining features. This enhancement improves classification accuracy and model confidence while reducing bias. We conclude with a discussion on the challenges of applying such models in clinical domains and outline directions for future work to improve generalizability across domain-independent healthcare scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[COOkeD: Ensemble-based OOD detection in the era of zero-shot CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22576v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an important building block in trustworthy image recognition systems as unknown classes may arise at test-time. OOD detection methods typically revolve around a single classifier, leading to a split in the research field between the classical supervised setting (e.g. ResNet18 classifier trained on CIFAR100) vs. the zero-shot setting (class names fed as prompts to CLIP). In both cases, an overarching challenge is that the OOD detection performance is implicitly constrained by the classifier's capabilities on in-distribution (ID) data. In this work, we show that given a little open-mindedness from both ends, remarkable OOD detection can be achieved by instead creating a heterogeneous ensemble - COOkeD combines the predictions of a closed-world classifier trained end-to-end on a specific dataset, a zero-shot CLIP classifier, and a linear probe classifier trained on CLIP image features. While bulky at first sight, this approach is modular, post-hoc and leverages the availability of pre-trained VLMs, thus introduces little overhead compared to training a single standard classifier. We evaluate COOkeD on popular CIFAR100 and ImageNet benchmarks, but also consider more challenging, realistic settings ranging from training-time label noise, to test-time covariate shift, to zero-shot shift which has been previously overlooked. Despite its simplicity, COOkeD achieves state-of-the-art performance and greater robustness compared to both classical and CLIP-based OOD detection methods.

| **[HQ-CLIP: Leveraging Large Vision-Language Models to Create High-Quality Image-Text Datasets and CLIP Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22431v1)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale but noisy image-text pair data have paved the way for the success of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP). As the foundation vision encoder, CLIP in turn serves as the cornerstone for most large vision-language models (LVLMs). This interdependence naturally raises an interesting question: Can we reciprocally leverage LVLMs to enhance the quality of image-text pair data, thereby opening the possibility of a self-reinforcing cycle for continuous improvement? In this work, we take a significant step toward this vision by introducing an LVLM-driven data refinement pipeline. Our framework leverages LVLMs to process images and their raw alt-text, generating four complementary textual formulas: long positive descriptions, long negative descriptions, short positive tags, and short negative tags. Applying this pipeline to the curated DFN-Large dataset yields VLM-150M, a refined dataset enriched with multi-grained annotations. Based on this dataset, we further propose a training paradigm that extends conventional contrastive learning by incorporating negative descriptions and short tags as additional supervised signals. The resulting model, namely HQ-CLIP, demonstrates remarkable improvements across diverse benchmarks. Within a comparable training data scale, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and fine-grained visual understanding tasks. In retrieval benchmarks, HQ-CLIP even surpasses standard CLIP models trained on the DFN-2B dataset, which contains 10$\times$ more training data than ours.

However, creators face significant challenges in designing these animations, such as crafting motions that align semantically with the metaphors, maintaining faithful data representation during animation, and seamlessly integrating interactivity. We propose a human-AI co-creation workflow that facilitates creating animations for SVG-based metaphoric visualizations. Users can initially derive animation clips for data elements from vision-language models (VLMs) and subsequently coordinate their timelines based on entity order, attribute values, spatial layout, or randomness. Our design decisions were informed by a formative study with experienced designers (N=8). We further developed a prototype, DataSway, and conducted a user study (N=14) to evaluate its creativity support and usability. A gallery with 6 cases demonstrates its capabilities and applications in web-based hypermedia. We conclude with implications for future research on bespoke data visualization animation.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures; Website: https://shellywhen.github.io/projects/DataSway</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v3)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical image analysis, combining complementary modalities like histology images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports, eliminating paired data requirement. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the target unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference time, only the improved vision model is used, with minimal computational overhead, enabling efficient pairing-free multimodal deployment. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of paired data training or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAPE: A CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble of Complementary Heatmap Cues for Embodied Reference Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21888v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing, and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features. Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold.</p></details> |  |
| **[EEG-CLIP : Learning EEG representations from natural language descriptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16531v2)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep networks for electroencephalogram (EEG) decoding are often only trained to solve one specific task, such as pathology or age decoding. A more general task-agnostic approach is to train deep networks to match a (clinical) EEG recording to its corresponding textual medical report and vice versa. This approach was pioneered in the computer vision domain matching images and their text captions and subsequently allowed to do successful zero-shot decoding using textual class prompts. In this work, we follow this approach and develop a contrastive learning framework, EEG-CLIP, that aligns the EEG time series and the descriptions of the corresponding clinical text in a shared embedding space. We investigated its potential for versatile EEG decoding, evaluating performance in a range of few-shot and zero-shot settings. Overall, we show that EEG-CLIP manages to non-trivially align text and EEG representations. Our work presents a promising approach to learn general EEG representations, which could enable easier analyses of diverse decoding questions through zero-shot decoding or training task-specific models from fewer training examples. The code for reproducing our results is available at https://github.com/tidiane-camaret/EEGClip</p></details> |  |
| **[Describe, Adapt and Combine: Empowering CLIP Encoders for Open-set 3D Object Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21489v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-set 3D object retrieval (3DOR) is an emerging task aiming to retrieve 3D objects of unseen categories beyond the training set. Existing methods typically utilize all modalities (i.e., voxels, point clouds, multi-view images) and train specific backbones before fusion. However, they still struggle to produce generalized representations due to insufficient 3D training data. Being contrastively pre-trained on web-scale image-text pairs, CLIP inherently produces generalized representations for a wide range of downstream tasks. Building upon it, we present a simple yet effective framework named Describe, Adapt and Combine (DAC) by taking only multi-view images for open-set 3DOR. DAC innovatively synergizes a CLIP model with a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) to learn generalized 3D representations, where the MLLM is used for dual purposes. First, it describes the seen category information to align with CLIP's training objective for adaptation during training. Second, it provides external hints about unknown objects complementary to visual cues during inference. To improve the synergy, we introduce an Additive-Bias Low-Rank adaptation (AB-LoRA), which alleviates overfitting and further enhances the generalization to unseen categories. With only multi-view images, DAC significantly surpasses prior arts by an average of +10.01\% mAP on four open-set 3DOR datasets. Moreover, its generalization is also validated on image-based and cross-dataset setups.

While these models have shown encouraging results in terms of accuracy and discriminative performance, their fairness and robustness in the different clinical tasks remain largely underexplored. In this study, we extensively evaluate six widely used CLIP-based models on chest X-ray classification using three publicly available datasets: MIMIC-CXR, NIH-CXR14, and NEATX. We assess the models fairness across six conditions and patient subgroups based on age, sex, and race. Additionally, we assess the robustness to shortcut learning by evaluating performance on pneumothorax cases with and without chest drains. Our results indicate performance gaps between patients of different ages, but more equitable results for the other attributes. Moreover, all models exhibit lower performance on images without chest drains, suggesting reliance on spurious correlations. We further complement the performance analysis with a study of the embeddings generated by the models. While the sensitive attributes could be classified from the embeddings, we do not see such patterns using PCA, showing the limitations of these visualisation techniques when assessing models.

| **[Rethinking Few Shot CLIP Benchmarks: A Critical Analysis in the Inductive Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20834v1)** | 2025-07-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is a foundational model with transferable classification performance in the few-shot setting. Several methods have shown improved performance of CLIP using few-shot examples. However, so far, all these techniques have been benchmarked using standard few-shot datasets. We argue that this mode of evaluation does not provide a true indication of the inductive generalization ability using few-shot examples. As most datasets have been seen by the CLIP model, the resultant setting can be termed as partially transductive. To solve this, we propose a pipeline that uses an unlearning technique to obtain true inductive baselines. In this new inductive setting, the methods show a significant drop in performance (-55% on average among 13 baselines with multiple datasets). We validate the unlearning technique using oracle baselines. An improved few-shot classification technique is proposed that consistently obtains state-of-the-art performance over 13 other recent baseline methods on a comprehensive analysis with 5880 experiments - varying the datasets, differing number of few-shot examples, unlearning setting, and with different seeds. Thus, we identify the issue with the evaluation of CLIP-based few-shot classification, provide a solution using unlearning, propose new benchmarks, and provide an improved method.</p></details> |  |
| **[AF-CLIP: Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection via Anomaly-Focused CLIP Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19949v1)** | 2025-07-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly detection has been widely used in industrial inspection and medical diagnosis. Existing methods typically demand substantial training samples, limiting their utility in zero-/few-shot scenarios. While recent efforts have leveraged CLIP's zero-shot recognition capability for this task, they often ignore optimizing visual features to focus on local anomalies, reducing their efficacy. In this work, we propose AF-CLIP (Anomaly-Focused CLIP) by dramatically enhancing its visual representations to focus on local defects. Our approach introduces a lightweight adapter that emphasizes anomaly-relevant patterns in visual features, simultaneously optimizing both class-level features for image classification and patch-level features for precise localization. To capture anomalies of different sizes and improve detection accuracy, prior to the adapter, we develop a multi-scale spatial aggregation mechanism to effectively consolidate neighborhood context. Complementing these visual enhancements, we design learnable textual prompts that generically characterize normal and abnormal states. After optimization on auxiliary datasets using a composite objective function, AF-CLIP demonstrates strong zero-shot detection capability. Our method is also extended to few-shot scenarios by extra memory banks. Experimental results across diverse industrial and medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed method.

A Deep Dive into RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08221v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning for LLM reasoning has rapidly emerged as a prominent research area, marked by a significant surge in related studies on both algorithmic innovations and practical applications. Despite this progress, several critical challenges remain, including the absence of standardized guidelines for employing RL techniques and a fragmented understanding of their underlying mechanisms. Additionally, inconsistent experimental settings, variations in training data, and differences in model initialization have led to conflicting conclusions, obscuring the key characteristics of these techniques and creating confusion among practitioners when selecting appropriate techniques. This paper systematically reviews widely adopted RL techniques through rigorous reproductions and isolated evaluations within a unified open-source framework. We analyze the internal mechanisms, applicable scenarios, and core principles of each technique through fine-grained experiments, including datasets of varying difficulty, model sizes, and architectures. Based on these insights, we present clear guidelines for selecting RL techniques tailored to specific setups, and provide a reliable roadmap for practitioners navigating the RL for the LLM domain. Finally, we reveal that a minimalist combination of two techniques can unlock the learning capability of critic-free policies using vanilla PPO loss. The results demonstrate that our simple combination consistently improves performance, surpassing strategies like GRPO and DAPO.</p></details> | 26 pages, 21 figures |
| **[Reinforcement Learning in Vision: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08189v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances at the intersection of reinforcement learning (RL) and visual intelligence have enabled agents that not only perceive complex visual scenes but also reason, generate, and act within them. This survey offers a critical and up-to-date synthesis of the field. We first formalize visual RL problems and trace the evolution of policy-optimization strategies from RLHF to verifiable reward paradigms, and from Proximal Policy Optimization to Group Relative Policy Optimization. We then organize more than 200 representative works into four thematic pillars: multi-modal large language models, visual generation, unified model frameworks, and vision-language-action models. For each pillar we examine algorithmic design, reward engineering, benchmark progress, and we distill trends such as curriculum-driven training, preference-aligned diffusion, and unified reward modeling. Finally, we review evaluation protocols spanning set-level fidelity, sample-level preference, and state-level stability, and we identify open challenges that include sample efficiency, generalization, and safe deployment. Our goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent map of the rapidly expanding landscape of visual RL and to highlight promising directions for future inquiry.

| **[MedReasoner: Reinforcement Learning Drives Reasoning Grounding from Clinical Thought to Pixel-Level Precision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08177v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[ReconDreamer-RL: Enhancing Reinforcement Learning via Diffusion-based Scene Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08170v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning for training end-to-end autonomous driving models in closed-loop simulations is gaining growing attention. However, most simulation environments differ significantly from real-world conditions, creating a substantial simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap. To bridge this gap, some approaches utilize scene reconstruction techniques to create photorealistic environments as a simulator. While this improves realistic sensor simulation, these methods are inherently constrained by the distribution of the training data, making it difficult to render high-quality sensor data for novel trajectories or corner case scenarios. Therefore, we propose ReconDreamer-RL, a framework designed to integrate video diffusion priors into scene reconstruction to aid reinforcement learning, thereby enhancing end-to-end autonomous driving training. Specifically, in ReconDreamer-RL, we introduce ReconSimulator, which combines the video diffusion prior for appearance modeling and incorporates a kinematic model for physical modeling, thereby reconstructing driving scenarios from real-world data. This narrows the sim2real gap for closed-loop evaluation and reinforcement learning. To cover more corner-case scenarios, we introduce the Dynamic Adversary Agent (DAA), which adjusts the trajectories of surrounding vehicles relative to the ego vehicle, autonomously generating corner-case traffic scenarios (e.g., cut-in). Finally, the Cousin Trajectory Generator (CTG) is proposed to address the issue of training data distribution, which is often biased toward simple straight-line movements. Experiments show that ReconDreamer-RL improves end-to-end autonomous driving training, outperforming imitation learning methods with a 5x reduction in the Collision Ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[REX-RAG: Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08149v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a powerful paradigm for enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform complex reasoning tasks. Recent advances indicate that integrating RL with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) allows LLMs to dynamically incorporate external knowledge, leading to more informed and robust decision making. However, we identify a critical challenge during policy-driven trajectory sampling: LLMs are frequently trapped in unproductive reasoning paths, which we refer to as "dead ends", committing to overconfident yet incorrect conclusions. This severely hampers exploration and undermines effective policy optimization. To address this challenge, we propose REX-RAG (Reasoning Exploration with Policy Correction in Retrieval-Augmented Generation), a novel framework that explores alternative reasoning paths while maintaining rigorous policy learning through principled distributional corrections. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) Mixed Sampling Strategy, which combines a novel probe sampling method with exploratory prompts to escape dead ends; and (2) Policy Correction Mechanism, which employs importance sampling to correct distribution shifts induced by mixed sampling, thereby mitigating gradient estimation bias. We evaluate it on seven question-answering benchmarks, and the experimental results show that REX-RAG achieves average performance gains of 5.1% on Qwen2.5-3B and 3.6% on Qwen2.5-7B over strong baselines, demonstrating competitive results across multiple datasets. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/MiliLab/REX-RAG.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

While deep neural networks (DNNs) demonstrate superior performance in control applications, their substantial computational complexity and memory requirements present significant barriers to practical deployment on edge devices. This paper introduces a comprehensive model compression methodology that leverages component-aware structured pruning to determine the optimal pruning magnitude for each pruning group, ensuring a balance between compression and stability for NNC deployment. Our approach is rigorously evaluated on Temporal Difference Model Predictive Control (TD-MPC), a state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, with a systematic integration of mathematical stability guarantee properties, specifically Lyapunov criteria. The key contribution of this work lies in providing a principled framework for determining the theoretical limits of model compression while preserving controller stability. Experimental validation demonstrates that our methodology successfully reduces model complexity while maintaining requisite control performance and stability characteristics. Furthermore, our approach establishes a quantitative boundary for safe compression ratios, enabling practitioners to systematically determine the maximum permissible model reduction before violating critical stability properties, thereby facilitating the confident deployment of compressed NNCs in resource-limited environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in: The 2026 IEEE/SICE International Symposium on System Integration (SII 2026)</p></details> |
| **[MathSmith: Towards Extremely Hard Mathematical Reasoning by Forging Synthetic Problems with a Reinforced Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05592v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have achieved substantial progress in mathematical reasoning, yet their advancement is limited by the scarcity of high-quality, high-difficulty training data. Existing synthesis methods largely rely on transforming human-written templates, limiting both diversity and scalability. We propose MathSmith, a novel framework for synthesizing challenging mathematical problems to enhance LLM reasoning. Rather than modifying existing problems, MathSmith constructs new ones from scratch by randomly sampling concept-explanation pairs from PlanetMath, ensuring data independence and avoiding contamination. To increase difficulty, we design nine predefined strategies as soft constraints during rationales. We further adopts reinforcement learning to jointly optimize structural validity, reasoning complexity, and answer consistency. The length of the reasoning trace generated under autoregressive prompting is used to reflect cognitive complexity, encouraging the creation of more demanding problems aligned with long-chain-of-thought reasoning. Experiments across five benchmarks, categorized as easy & medium (GSM8K, MATH-500) and hard (AIME2024, AIME2025, OlympiadBench), show that MathSmith consistently outperforms existing baselines under both short and long CoT settings. Additionally, a weakness-focused variant generation module enables targeted improvement on specific concepts. Overall, MathSmith exhibits strong scalability, generalization, and transferability, highlighting the promise of high-difficulty synthetic data in advancing LLM reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning with Local Interpretability for Transparent Microgrid Resilience Energy Management](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08132v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Renewable energy integration into microgrids has become a key approach to addressing global energy issues such as climate change and resource scarcity. However, the variability of renewable sources and the rising occurrence of High Impact Low Probability (HILP) events require innovative strategies for reliable and resilient energy management. This study introduces a practical approach to managing microgrid resilience through Explainable Deep Reinforcement Learning (XDRL). It combines the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for decision-making with the Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) method to improve the transparency of the actor network's decisions. A case study in Ongole, India, examines a microgrid with wind, solar, and battery components to validate the proposed approach. The microgrid is simulated under extreme weather conditions during the Layla cyclone. LIME is used to analyse scenarios, showing the impact of key factors such as renewable generation, state of charge, and load prioritization on decision-making. The results demonstrate a Resilience Index (RI) of 0.9736 and an estimated battery lifespan of 15.11 years. LIME analysis reveals the rationale behind the agent's actions in idle, charging, and discharging modes, with renewable generation identified as the most influential feature. This study shows the effectiveness of integrating advanced DRL algorithms with interpretable AI techniques to achieve reliable and transparent energy management in microgrids.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep search works are generally limited to a single knowledge source, either local or the Web. However, enterprises often require private deep search systems that can leverage search tools over both local and the Web corpus. Simply training an agent equipped with multiple search tools using flat reinforcement learning (RL) is a straightforward idea, but it has problems such as low training data efficiency and poor mastery of complex tools. To address the above issue, we propose a hierarchical agentic deep search framework, HierSearch, trained with hierarchical RL. At the low level, a local deep search agent and a Web deep search agent are trained to retrieve evidence from their corresponding domains. At the high level, a planner agent coordinates low-level agents and provides the final answer. Moreover, to prevent direct answer copying and error propagation, we design a knowledge refiner that filters out hallucinations and irrelevant evidence returned by low-level agents. Experiments show that HierSearch achieves better performance compared to flat RL, and outperforms various deep search and multi-source retrieval-augmented generation baselines in six benchmarks across general, finance, and medical domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and datasets are available at https://github.com/plageon/HierSearch</p></details> |

However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning. To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex information retrieval involving both visual and textual information. Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal information-seeking tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[A Deep Learning Based Resource Allocator for Communication Networks with Dynamic User Utility Demands](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04600v3)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) based resource allocation (RA) has recently gained significant attention due to its performance efficiency. However, most related studies assume an ideal case where the number of users and their utility demands, e.g., data rate constraints, are fixed, and the designed DL-based RA scheme exploits a policy trained only for these fixed parameters. Consequently, computationally complex policy retraining is required whenever these parameters change. In this paper, we introduce a DL-based resource allocator (ALCOR) that allows users to adjust their utility demands freely, such as based on their application layer requirements. ALCOR employs deep neural networks (DNNs) as the policy in a time-sharing problem. The underlying optimization algorithm iteratively optimizes the on-off status of users to satisfy their utility demands in expectation. The policy performs unconstrained RA (URA) -- RA without considering user utility demands -- among active users to maximize the sum utility (SU) at each time instant. Depending on the chosen URA scheme, ALCOR can perform RA in either a centralized or distributed scenario. The derived convergence analyses provide theoretical guarantees for ALCOR's convergence, and numerical experiments corroborate its effectiveness compared to meta-learning and reinforcement learning approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications.

However, their deployment in real-time and mobile environments remains challenging due to the iterative and resource-intensive nature of the inference process. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces a unified optimization framework that jointly tackles service placement and multiple access control for GDMs in mobile edge networks. We propose LEARN-GDM, a Deep Reinforcement Learning-based algorithm that dynamically partitions denoising blocks across heterogeneous edge nodes, while accounting for latent transmission costs and enabling adaptive reduction of inference steps. Our approach integrates a greedy multiple access scheme with a Double and Dueling Deep Q-Learning (D3QL)-based service placement, allowing for scalable, adaptable, and resource-efficient operation under stringent quality of service requirements. Simulations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework in terms of scalability and latency resilience compared to conventional monolithic and fixed chain-length placement strategies. This work advances the state of the art in edge-enabled GenAI by offering an adaptable solution for GDM services orchestration, paving the way for future extensions toward semantic networking and co-inference across distributed environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been accepted for presentation at IEEE GLOBECOM 2025.

Despite notable advances enabled by existing RLHF training frameworks, significant challenges remain in scaling to complex multimodal workflows and adapting to dynamic workloads. In particular, current systems often encounter limitations related to controller scalability when managing large models, as well as inefficiencies in orchestrating intricate RLHF pipelines, especially in scenarios that require dynamic sampling and resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce WeChat-YATT (Yet Another Transformer Trainer in WeChat), a simple, scalable, and balanced RLHF training framework specifically designed to address these challenges. WeChat-YATT features a parallel controller programming model that enables flexible and efficient orchestration of complex RLHF workflows, effectively mitigating the bottlenecks associated with centralized controller architectures and facilitating scalability in large-scale data scenarios. In addition, we propose a dynamic placement schema that adaptively partitions computational resources and schedules workloads, thereby significantly reducing hardware idle time and improving GPU utilization under variable training conditions.

These limitations manifest as two key challenges: pervasive misinformation in the web environment, which introduces unreliable or misleading content that can degrade retrieval accuracy, and the underutilization of web tools, which, if effectively employed, could enhance query precision and help mitigate this noise, ultimately improving the retrieval results in RAG systems. To address these issues, we propose WebFilter, a novel RAG framework that generates source-restricted queries and filters out unreliable content. This approach combines a retrieval filtering mechanism with a behavior- and outcome-driven reward strategy, optimizing both query formulation and retrieval outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that WebFilter improves answer quality and retrieval precision, outperforming existing RAG methods on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, trained on past trajectories, is used to estimate the next position of each robot. This prediction allows us to define an anticipated collision risk by dynamically modulating the reward of a Deep Q-Learning Network (DQN) agent. The approach is tested in a constrained environment, where two robots move without communication or identifiers. Despite a limited sampling frequency (1 Hz), the results show a significant decrease of the collisions number and a stability improvement. The proposed method, which is computationally inexpensive, appears particularly attractive for implementation on embedded systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoCoT: Overcoming the Exploration Bottleneck in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07809v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their reasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard problems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing exploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for distillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or restricts reasoning improvement through exploration. We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on two-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the exploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then gradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables LLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse rewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek, and Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously unsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT supervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods. We release the source code to support future research.</p></details> |  |

While pose-specific multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promise in this task, they are typically trained with supervised objectives such as SMPL parameter regression or token-level prediction, which struggle to model the inherent ambiguity and achieve task-specific alignment required for accurate 3D pose generation. To address these limitations, we propose Pose-RFT, a reinforcement fine-tuning framework tailored for 3D human pose generation in MLLMs. We formulate the task as a hybrid action reinforcement learning problem that jointly optimizes discrete language prediction and continuous pose generation. To this end, we introduce HyGRPO, a hybrid reinforcement learning algorithm that performs group-wise reward normalization over sampled responses to guide joint optimization of discrete and continuous actions. Pose-RFT further incorporates task-specific reward functions to guide optimization towards spatial alignment in image-to-pose generation and semantic consistency in text-to-pose generation. Extensive experiments on multiple pose generation benchmarks demonstrate that Pose-RFT significantly improves performance over existing pose-specific MLLMs, validating the effectiveness of hybrid action reinforcement fine-tuning for 3D pose generation.</p></details> |  |

As humanoid robots are usually designed to operate in human-centric environments and interact with everyday objects, mastering dexterous manipulation is critical for real-world deployment. Traditional approaches, such as reinforcement learning and imitation learning, have made significant strides, but they often struggle due to the unique challenges of real-world dexterous manipulation, including high-dimensional control, limited training data, and covariate shift. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of these challenges and reviews existing learning-based methods for real-world dexterous manipulation, spanning imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and hybrid approaches. A promising yet underexplored direction is interactive imitation learning, where human feedback actively refines a robots behavior during training. While interactive imitation learning has shown success in various robotic tasks, its application to dexterous manipulation remains limited. To address this gap, we examine current interactive imitation learning techniques applied to other robotic tasks and discuss how these methods can be adapted to enhance dexterous manipulation. By synthesizing state-of-the-art research, this paper highlights key challenges, identifies gaps in current methodologies, and outlines potential directions for leveraging interactive imitation learning to improve dexterous robotic skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[On the Sample Efficiency of Abstractions and Potential-Based Reward Shaping in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07826v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Potential-Based Reward Shaping (PBRS) has shown great promise in the ongoing research effort to tackle sample inefficiency in Reinforcement Learning (RL). However, choosing the right potential function remains an open challenge. Additionally, RL techniques are usually constrained to use a finite horizon for computational limitations, which introduces a bias when using PBRS. In this paper, we first build some theoretically-grounded intuition on why selecting the potential function as the optimal value function of the task at hand produces performance advantages. We then analyse the bias induced by finite horizons in the context of PBRS producing novel insights. Finally, leveraging abstractions as a way to approximate the optimal value function of the given task, we assess the sample efficiency and performance impact of PBRS on four environments including a goal-oriented navigation task and three Arcade Learning Environments (ALE) games. Remarkably, experimental results show that we can reach the same level of performance as CNN-based solutions with a simple fully-connected network.</p></details> |  |

However, conventional RL faces challenges when dealing with complex, real-world constraints, especially when action space feasibility is explicit and dependent on the corresponding state or trajectory. In this work, we address stochastic sequential dynamic decision-making problems with state-dependent constraints. As a relevant and real-world case study, we focus on the master stowage planning problem in container shipping, which aims to optimize revenue and operational costs under demand uncertainty and operational constraints. We propose a deep RL framework with an encoder-decoder model and feasibility layers that satisfy convex constraints and maintain unbiased gradient flow, which embed problem instances, current solutions, and demand uncertainty to guide learning. Experiments show that our model efficiently finds adaptive, feasible solutions that generalize across varying distributions and scale to larger instances, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in constrained RL and stochastic programming. By uniting artificial intelligence and operations research, our policy empowers humans to make adaptive, uncertainty-aware decisions for resilient and sustainable planning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Align, Aligning to Learn: A Unified Approach for Self-Optimized Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07750v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment methodologies have emerged as a critical pathway for enhancing language model alignment capabilities. While SFT (supervised fine-tuning) accelerates convergence through direct token-level loss intervention, its efficacy is constrained by offline policy trajectory. In contrast, RL(reinforcement learning) facilitates exploratory policy optimization, but suffers from low sample efficiency and stringent dependency on high-quality base models. To address these dual challenges, we propose GRAO (Group Relative Alignment Optimization), a unified framework that synergizes the respective strengths of SFT and RL through three key innovations: 1) A multi-sample generation strategy enabling comparative quality assessment via reward feedback; 2) A novel Group Direct Alignment Loss formulation leveraging intra-group relative advantage weighting; 3) Reference-aware parameter updates guided by pairwise preference dynamics. Our theoretical analysis establishes GRAO's convergence guarantees and sample efficiency advantages over conventional approaches. Comprehensive evaluations across complex human alignment tasks demonstrate GRAO's superior performance, achieving 57.70\%,17.65\% 7.95\% and 5.18\% relative improvements over SFT, DPO, PPO and GRPO baselines respectively. This work provides both a theoretically grounded alignment framework and empirical evidence for efficient capability evolution in language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While algorithm development has progressed rapidly, significant theoretical advances have also been made in understanding the fundamental challenges of offline RL. However, bridging these theoretical insights with practical algorithm design remains an ongoing challenge. In this survey, we explore key intuitions derived from theoretical work and their implications for offline RL algorithms. We begin by listing the conditions needed for the proofs, including function representation and data coverage assumptions. Function representation conditions tell us what to expect for generalization, and data coverage assumptions describe the quality requirement of the data. We then examine counterexamples, where offline RL is not solvable without an impractically large amount of data. These cases highlight what cannot be achieved for all algorithms and the inherent hardness of offline RL. Building on techniques to mitigate these challenges, we discuss the conditions that are sufficient for offline RL. These conditions are not merely assumptions for theoretical proofs, but they also reveal the limitations of these algorithms and remind us to search for novel solutions when the conditions cannot be satisfied.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Reinforcement Learning over Wireless Networks with Homomorphic State Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07722v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the problem of training Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents over communication networks. The RL paradigm requires the agent to instantaneously perceive the state evolution to infer the effects of its actions on the environment. This is impossible if the agent receives state updates over lossy or delayed wireless systems and thus operates with partial and intermittent information. In recent years, numerous frameworks have been proposed to manage RL with imperfect feedback; however, they often offer specific solutions with a substantial computational burden. To address these limits, we propose a novel architecture, named Homomorphic Robust Remote Reinforcement Learning (HR3L), that enables the training of remote RL agents exchanging observations across a non-ideal wireless channel. HR3L considers two units: the transmitter, which encodes meaningful representations of the environment, and the receiver, which decodes these messages and performs actions to maximize a reward signal. Importantly, HR3L does not require the exchange of gradient information across the wireless channel, allowing for quicker training and a lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art solutions. Experimental results demonstrate that HR3L significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of sample efficiency and adapts to different communication scenarios, including packet losses, delayed transmissions, and capacity limitations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is currently under revision</p></details> |

Unlike conventional control methods, the proposed method directly generates gate signals using a neural network trained through DRL, with the objective of achieving high control speed and flexibility while maintaining stability. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed direct gate control (DGC) method achieves a faster transient response and stable output voltage regulation, outperforming traditional PWM-based control schemes. The DGC method also exhibits strong robustness against parameter variations and sensor noise, indicating its suitability for practical power electronics applications. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated via simulation.</p></details> |  |

In many real-world scenarios, the terrain is not that difficult and these mixed terrain types introduce the need for flexible use of different walking strategies to achieve mission goals in a fast, reliable, and energy-efficient way. Six-legged robots have a high degree of flexibility and inherent stability that aids them in traversing even some of the most difficult terrains, such as collapsed buildings. However, their lack of fast walking gaits for easier surfaces is one reason why they are not commonly applied in these scenarios. This work presents LAURON VI, a six-legged robot platform for research on dynamic walking gaits as well as on autonomy for complex field missions. The robot's 18 series elastic joint actuators offer high-frequency interfaces for Cartesian impedance and pure torque control. We have designed, implemented, and compared three control approaches: kinematic-based, model-predictive, and reinforcement-learned controllers. The robot hardware and the different control approaches were extensively tested in a lab environment as well as on a Mars analog mission. The introduction of fast locomotion strategies for LAURON VI makes six-legged robots vastly more suitable for a wide range of real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[TAR-TVG: Enhancing VLMs with Timestamp Anchor-Constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07683v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal Video Grounding (TVG) aims to precisely localize video segments corresponding to natural language queries, which is a critical capability for long-form video understanding. Although existing reinforcement learning approaches encourage models to generate reasoning chains before predictions, they fail to explicitly constrain the reasoning process to ensure the quality of the final temporal predictions. To address this limitation, we propose Timestamp Anchor-constrained Reasoning for Temporal Video Grounding (TAR-TVG), a novel framework that introduces timestamp anchors within the reasoning process to enforce explicit supervision to the thought content. These anchors serve as intermediate verification points. More importantly, we require each reasoning step to produce increasingly accurate temporal estimations, thereby ensuring that the reasoning process contributes meaningfully to the final prediction. To address the challenge of low-probability anchor generation in models (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-3B), we develop an efficient self-distillation training strategy: (1) initial GRPO training to collect 30K high-quality reasoning traces containing multiple timestamp anchors, (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on distilled data, and (3) final GRPO optimization on the SFT-enhanced model. This three-stage training strategy enables robust anchor generation while maintaining reasoning quality. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance while producing interpretable, verifiable reasoning chains with progressively refined temporal estimations.</p></details> |  |

Previous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches to sepsis management rely primarily on structured data, such as lab results or vital signs, and on a dearth of a comprehensive understanding of the patient's condition. In this work, we propose a Multimodal Offline REinforcement learning for Clinical notes Leveraged Enhanced stAte Representation (MORE-CLEAR) framework for sepsis control in intensive care units. MORE-CLEAR employs pre-trained large-scale language models (LLMs) to facilitate the extraction of rich semantic representations from clinical notes, preserving clinical context and improving patient state representation. Gated fusion and cross-modal attention allow dynamic weight adjustment in the context of time and the effective integration of multimodal data. Extensive cross-validation using two public (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and one private dataset demonstrates that MORE-CLEAR significantly improves estimated survival rate and policy performance compared to single-modal RL approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first to leverage LLM capabilities within a multimodal offline RL for better state representation in medical applications. This approach can potentially expedite the treatment and management of sepsis by enabling reinforcement learning models to propose enhanced actions based on a more comprehensive understanding of patient conditions.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

However, the major design issues of the considered system are the severely limited energy supply and unexpected node malfunctions. This paper aims to provide fair, efficient, and reliable (FER) communication to the imperfect and energy-constrained UWSNs (IC-UWSNs). Therefore, we formulate a FER-communication optimization problem (FERCOP) and propose ICRL-JSA to solve the formulated problem. ICRL-JSA is a deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)-based optimizer for IC-UWSNs through joint link scheduling and power allocation, which automatically learns scheduling algorithms without human intervention. However, conventional RL methods are unable to address the challenges posed by underwater environments and IC-UWSNs. To construct ICRL-JSA, we integrate deep Q-network into IC-UWSNs and propose an advanced training mechanism to deal with complex acoustic channels, limited energy supplies, and unexpected node malfunctions. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ICRL-JSA scheme with an advanced training mechanism compared to various benchmark algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing</p></details> |

| **[Unintended Bias in 2D+ Image Segmentation and Its Effect on Attention Asymmetry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14105v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised pretrained models have become widely used in deep learning, especially for image segmentation tasks. However, when applied to specialized datasets such as biomedical imaging, pretrained weights often introduce unintended biases. These biases cause models to assign different levels of importance to different slices, leading to inconsistencies in feature utilization, which can be observed as asymmetries in saliency map distributions. This transfer of color distributions from natural images to non-natural datasets can compromise model performance and reduce the reliability of results. In this study, we investigate the effects of these biases and propose strategies to mitigate them. Through a series of experiments, we test both pretrained and randomly initialized models, comparing their performance and saliency map distributions. Our proposed methods, which aim to neutralize the bias introduced by pretrained color channel weights, demonstrate promising results, offering a practical approach to improving model explainability while maintaining the benefits of pretrained models. This publication presents our findings, providing insights into addressing pretrained weight biases across various deep learning tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce mAIstro, an open-source, autonomous multi-agentic framework for end-to-end development and deployment of medical AI models. The system orchestrates exploratory data analysis, radiomic feature extraction, image segmentation, classification, and regression through a natural language interface, requiring no coding from the user. Built on a modular architecture, mAIstro supports both open- and closed-source LLMs, and was evaluated using a large and diverse set of prompts across 16 open-source datasets, covering a wide range of imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and data types. The agents successfully executed all tasks, producing interpretable outputs and validated models. This work presents the first agentic framework capable of unifying data analysis, AI model development, and inference across varied healthcare applications, offering a reproducible and extensible foundation for clinical and research AI integration.

| **[A Registration-Based Star-Shape Segmentation Model and Fast Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07721v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation plays a crucial role in extracting objects of interest and identifying their boundaries within an image. However, accurate segmentation becomes challenging when dealing with occlusions, obscurities, or noise in corrupted images. To tackle this challenge, prior information is often utilized, with recent attention on star-shape priors. In this paper, we propose a star-shape segmentation model based on the registration framework. By combining the level set representation with the registration framework and imposing constraints on the deformed level set function, our model enables both full and partial star-shape segmentation, accommodating single or multiple centers. Additionally, our approach allows for the enforcement of identified boundaries to pass through specified landmark locations. We tackle the proposed models using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Through numerical experiments conducted on synthetic and real images, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in achieving accurate star-shape segmentation.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Positive and Unlabeled Learning (PU learning), which uses only positive and unlabeled data for binary classification problems, to obtain the appropriate metric for discriminating foreground and background regions on each unlabeled image. Our PU learning makes us easy to select pseudo-labels for various background regions. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches rely on multi-hospital data, but data collection challenges often make this impractical. Therefore, the proposed domain generalization method captures and leverages intra-hospital domain shifts by clustering WSI-level features from non-tumor regions and treating these clusters as domains. To mitigate domain shift, we apply contrastive learning to reduce feature gaps between WSI pairs from different clusters. The proposed method introduces a two-stage contrastive learning approach WSI-level and patch-level contrastive learning to minimize these gaps effectively.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, existing work merely supervises either the coarse-grained semantic features or fine-grained detailed features in isolation, which compromises the fact that these two types of features hold vital relationships in medical image analysis. We advocate the powers of complementary feature supervision for medical image segmentation, by proposing a Detail-Semantic Deep Supervision Network (DS$^2$Net). DS$^2$Net navigates both low-level detailed and high-level semantic feature supervision through Detail Enhance Module (DEM) and Semantic Enhance Module (SEM). DEM and SEM respectively harness low-level and high-level feature maps to create detail and semantic masks for enhancing feature supervision. This is a novel shift from single-view deep supervision to multi-view deep supervision. DS$^2$Net is also equipped with a novel uncertainty-based supervision loss that adaptively assigns the supervision strength of features within distinct scales based on their uncertainty, thus circumventing the sub-optimal heuristic design that typifies previous works. Through extensive experiments on six benchmarks captured under either colonoscopy, ultrasound and microscope, we demonstrate that DS$^2$Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods for medical image analysis.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies use strong-weak pseudo supervision to leverage unlabeled data. However, performance is often hindered by inconsistencies between pseudo labels and their corresponding unlabeled images. In this work, we propose \textbf{SynMatch}, a novel framework that sidesteps the need for improving pseudo labels by synthesizing images to match them instead. Specifically, SynMatch synthesizes images using texture and shape features extracted from the same segmentation model that generates the corresponding pseudo labels for unlabeled images. This design enables the generation of highly consistent synthesized-image-pseudo-label pairs without requiring any training parameters for image synthesis. We extensively evaluate SynMatch across diverse medical image segmentation tasks under semi-supervised learning (SSL), weakly-supervised learning (WSL), and barely-supervised learning (BSL) settings with increasingly limited annotations. The results demonstrate that SynMatch achieves superior performance, especially in the most challenging BSL setting. For example, it outperforms the recent strong-weak pseudo supervision-based method by 29.71\% and 10.05\% on the polyp segmentation task with 5\% and 10\% scribble annotations, respectively. The code will be released at https://github.com/Senyh/SynMatch.</p></details> |  |

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets.

While many coarse-grained segmentation (CGS) methods have been successful in large-scale segmentation (e.g., organs), they fall short in clinical scenarios requiring fine-grained segmentation (FGS), which remains challenging due to frequent individual variations in small-scale anatomical structures. Although recent Mamba-based models have advanced medical image segmentation, they often rely on fixed manually-defined scanning orders, which limit their adaptability to individual variations in FGS. To address this, we propose ASM-UNet, a novel Mamba-based architecture for FGS. It introduces adaptive scan scores to dynamically guide the scanning order, generated by combining group-level commonalities and individual-level variations. Experiments on two public datasets (ACDC and Synapse) and a newly proposed challenging biliary tract FGS dataset, namely BTMS, demonstrate that ASM-UNet achieves superior performance in both CGS and FGS tasks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/YqunYang/ASM-UNet.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study, we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures, with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks, including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis, thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its clinical applicability.</p></details> |  |

However, this task remains challenging due to low contrast with surrounding mucosa, specular highlights, and indistinct boundaries. To address these challenges, we propose FOCUS-Med, which stands for Fusion of spatial and structural graph with attentional context-aware polyp segmentation in endoscopic medical imaging. FOCUS-Med integrates a Dual Graph Convolutional Network (Dual-GCN) module to capture contextual spatial and topological structural dependencies. This graph-based representation enables the model to better distinguish polyps from background tissues by leveraging topological cues and spatial connectivity, which are often obscured in raw image intensities. It enhances the model's ability to preserve boundaries and delineate complex shapes typical of polyps. In addition, a location-fused stand-alone self-attention is employed to strengthen global context integration. To bridge the semantic gap between encoder-decoder layers, we incorporate a trainable weighted fast normalized fusion strategy for efficient multi-scale aggregation. Notably, we are the first to introduce the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed qualitative evaluations of segmentation quality. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that FOCUS-Med achieves state-of-the-art performance across five key metrics, underscoring its effectiveness and clinical potential for AI-assisted colonoscopy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review</p></details> |
| **[S2-UniSeg: Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling for Scalable Segment Anything without Supervision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06995v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent self-supervised image segmentation models have achieved promising performance on semantic segmentation and class-agnostic instance segmentation. However, their pretraining schedule is multi-stage, requiring a time-consuming pseudo-masks generation process between each training epoch. This time-consuming offline process not only makes it difficult to scale with training dataset size, but also leads to sub-optimal solutions due to its discontinuous optimization routine. To solve these, we first present a novel pseudo-mask algorithm, Fast Universal Agglomerative Pooling (UniAP). Each layer of UniAP can identify groups of similar nodes in parallel, allowing to generate both semantic-level and instance-level and multi-granular pseudo-masks within ens of milliseconds for one image. Based on the fast UniAP, we propose the Scalable Self-Supervised Universal Segmentation (S2-UniSeg), which employs a student and a momentum teacher for continuous pretraining. A novel segmentation-oriented pretext task, Query-wise Self-Distillation (QuerySD), is proposed to pretrain S2-UniSeg to learn the local-to-global correspondences. Under the same setting, S2-UniSeg outperforms the SOTA UnSAM model, achieving notable improvements of AP+6.9 on COCO, AR+11.1 on UVO, PixelAcc+4.5 on COCOStuff-27, RQ+8.0 on Cityscapes. After scaling up to a larger 2M-image subset of SA-1B, S2-UniSeg further achieves performance gains on all four benchmarks. Our code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/bio-mlhui/S2-UniSeg</p></details> |  |
| **[WeatherDiffusion: Weather-Guided Diffusion Model for Forward and Inverse Rendering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06982v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forward and inverse rendering have emerged as key techniques for enabling understanding and reconstruction in the context of autonomous driving (AD). However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task. The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Implemention of Two-Phase Image Segmentation using the Split Bregman Method](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06351v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we describe an implementation of the two-phase image segmentation algorithm proposed by Goldstein, Bresson, Osher in \cite{gold:bre}. This algorithm partitions the domain of a given 2d image into foreground and background regions, and each pixel of the image is assigned membership to one of these two regions. The underlying assumption for the segmentation model is that the pixel values of the input image can be summarized by two distinct average values, and that the region boundaries are smooth. Accordingly, the model is defined as an energy in which the variable is a region membership function to assign pixels to either region, originally proposed by Chan and Vese in \cite{chan:vese}. This energy is the sum of image data terms in the regions and a length penalty for region boundaries. Goldstein, Bresson, Osher modify the energy of Chan-Vese in \cite{gold:bre} so that their new energy can be minimized efficiently using the split Bregman method to produce an equivalent two-phase segmentation. We provide a detailed implementation of this method \cite{gold:bre}, and document its performance with several images over a range of algorithm parameters.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Weakly supervised learning (WSL) based on sparse annotation has achieved encouraging performance and demonstrated the potential to reduce annotation costs. This study attempts to introduce scribble-based WSL into ultrasound image segmentation tasks. However, ultrasound images often suffer from poor contrast and unclear edges, coupled with insufficient supervison signals for edges, posing challenges to edge prediction. Uncertainty modeling has been proven to facilitate models in dealing with these issues. Nevertheless, existing uncertainty estimation paradigms are not robust enough and often filter out predictions near decision boundaries, resulting in unstable edge predictions. Therefore, we propose leveraging predictions near decision boundaries effectively. Specifically, we introduce Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) of evidence to design an Evidence-Guided Consistency strategy. This strategy utilizes high-evidence predictions, which are more likely to occur near high-density regions, to guide the optimization of low-evidence predictions that may appear near decision boundaries. Furthermore, the diverse sizes and locations of lesions in ultrasound images pose a challenge for CNNs with local receptive fields, as they struggle to model global information. Therefore, we introduce Visual Mamba based on structured state space sequence models, which achieves long-range dependency with linear computational complexity, and we construct a novel hybrid CNN-Mamba framework. During training, the collaboration between the CNN branch and the Mamba branch in the proposed framework draws inspiration from each other based on the EGC strategy. Experiments demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method. Dataset and code will be available on https://github.com/GtLinyer/MambaEviScrib.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Information Fusion</p></details> |
| **[A Semantic Segmentation Algorithm for Pleural Effusion Based on DBIF-AUNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06191v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness. Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Temporal Cluster Assignment for Efficient Real-Time Video Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05851v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Transformers have substantially advanced the capabilities of segmentation models across both image and video domains. Among them, the Swin Transformer stands out for its ability to capture hierarchical, multi-scale representations, making it a popular backbone for segmentation in videos. However, despite its window-attention scheme, it still incurs a high computational cost, especially in larger variants commonly used for dense prediction in videos. This remains a major bottleneck for real-time, resource-constrained applications. Whilst token reduction methods have been proposed to alleviate this, the window-based attention mechanism of Swin requires a fixed number of tokens per window, limiting the applicability of conventional pruning techniques. Meanwhile, training-free token clustering approaches have shown promise in image segmentation while maintaining window consistency. Nevertheless, they fail to exploit temporal redundancy, missing a key opportunity to further optimize video segmentation performance. We introduce Temporal Cluster Assignment (TCA), a lightweight and effective, fine-tuning-free strategy that enhances token clustering by leveraging temporal coherence across frames. Instead of indiscriminately dropping redundant tokens, TCA refines token clusters using temporal correlations, thereby retaining fine-grained details while significantly reducing computation. Extensive evaluations on YouTube-VIS 2019, YouTube-VIS 2021, OVIS, and a private surgical video dataset show that TCA consistently boosts the accuracy-speed trade-off of existing clustering-based methods. Our results demonstrate that TCA generalizes competently across both natural and domain-specific videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[FedGIN: Federated Learning with Dynamic Global Intensity Non-linear Augmentation for Organ Segmentation using Multi-modal Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05137v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays a crucial role in AI-assisted diagnostics, surgical planning, and treatment monitoring. Accurate and robust segmentation models are essential for enabling reliable, data-driven clinical decision making across diverse imaging modalities. Given the inherent variability in image characteristics across modalities, developing a unified model capable of generalizing effectively to multiple modalities would be highly beneficial. This model could streamline clinical workflows and reduce the need for modality-specific training. However, real-world deployment faces major challenges, including data scarcity, domain shift between modalities (e.g., CT vs. MRI), and privacy restrictions that prevent data sharing. To address these issues, we propose FedGIN, a Federated Learning (FL) framework that enables multimodal organ segmentation without sharing raw patient data. Our method integrates a lightweight Global Intensity Non-linear (GIN) augmentation module that harmonizes modality-specific intensity distributions during local training. We evaluated FedGIN using two types of datasets: an imputed dataset and a complete dataset. In the limited dataset scenario, the model was initially trained using only MRI data, and CT data was added to assess its performance improvements. In the complete dataset scenario, both MRI and CT data were fully utilized for training on all clients. In the limited-data scenario, FedGIN achieved a 12 to 18% improvement in 3D Dice scores on MRI test cases compared to FL without GIN and consistently outperformed local baselines. In the complete dataset scenario, FedGIN demonstrated near-centralized performance, with a 30% Dice score improvement over the MRI-only baseline and a 10% improvement over the CT-only baseline, highlighting its strong cross-modality generalization under privacy constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper Accepted at MICCAI 2025 DeCaf Workshop Track</p></details> |
| **[Latent Expression Generation for Referring Image Segmentation and Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05123v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding tasks, such as referring image segmentation (RIS) and referring expression comprehension (REC), aim to localize a target object based on a given textual description. The target object in an image can be described in multiple ways, reflecting diverse attributes such as color, position, and more. However, most existing methods rely on a single textual input, which captures only a fraction of the rich information available in the visual domain. This mismatch between rich visual details and sparse textual cues can lead to the misidentification of similar objects. To address this, we propose a novel visual grounding framework that leverages multiple latent expressions generated from a single textual input by incorporating complementary visual details absent from the original description. Specifically, we introduce subject distributor and visual concept injector modules to embed both shared-subject and distinct-attributes concepts into the latent representations, thereby capturing unique and target-specific visual cues. We also propose a positive-margin contrastive learning strategy to align all latent expressions with the original text while preserving subtle variations. Experimental results show that our method not only outperforms state-of-the-art RIS and REC approaches on multiple benchmarks but also achieves outstanding performance on the generalized referring expression segmentation (GRES) benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, their application to medical imaging remains challenging due to the high variability and complexity of medical data. Specifically, medical images often exhibit significant domain shifts caused by various confounders, including equipment differences, procedure artifacts, and imaging modes, which can lead to poor generalization when models are applied to unseen domains. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Causal-Driven Representation Learning (MCDRL), a novel framework that integrates causal inference with the VLM to tackle domain generalization in medical image segmentation. MCDRL is implemented in two steps: first, it leverages CLIP's cross-modal capabilities to identify candidate lesion regions and construct a confounder dictionary through text prompts, specifically designed to represent domain-specific variations; second, it trains a causal intervention network that utilizes this dictionary to identify and eliminate the influence of these domain-specific variations while preserving the anatomical structural information critical for segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MCDRL consistently outperforms competing methods, yielding superior segmentation accuracy and exhibiting robust generalizability.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Beyond Adapter Retrieval: Latent Geometry-Preserving Composition via Sparse Task Projection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09908v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in parameter-efficient transfer learning have demonstrated the utility of composing LoRA adapters from libraries of pretrained modules. However, most existing approaches rely on simple retrieval heuristics or uniform averaging, which overlook the latent structure of task relationships in representation space. We propose a new framework for adapter reuse that moves beyond retrieval, formulating adapter composition as a geometry-aware sparse reconstruction problem. Specifically, we represent each task by a latent prototype vector derived from the base model's encoder and aim to approximate the target task prototype as a sparse linear combination of retrieved reference prototypes, under an $\ell_1$-regularized optimization objective. The resulting combination weights are then used to blend the corresponding LoRA adapters, yielding a composite adapter tailored to the target task. This formulation not only preserves the local geometric structure of the task representation manifold, but also promotes interpretability and efficient reuse by selecting a minimal set of relevant adapters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple domains-including medical image segmentation, medical report generation and image synthesis. Our results highlight the benefit of coupling retrieval with latent geometry-aware optimization for improved zero-shot generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[X-SAM: From Segment Anything to Any Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04655v1)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong capabilities in broad knowledge representation, yet they are inherently deficient in pixel-level perceptual understanding. Although the Segment Anything Model (SAM) represents a significant advancement in visual-prompt-driven image segmentation, it exhibits notable limitations in multi-mask prediction and category-specific segmentation tasks, and it cannot integrate all segmentation tasks within a unified model architecture. To address these limitations, we present X-SAM, a streamlined Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) framework that extends the segmentation paradigm from \textit{segment anything} to \textit{any segmentation}. Specifically, we introduce a novel unified framework that enables more advanced pixel-level perceptual comprehension for MLLMs. Furthermore, we propose a new segmentation task, termed Visual GrounDed (VGD) segmentation, which segments all instance objects with interactive visual prompts and empowers MLLMs with visual grounded, pixel-wise interpretative capabilities. To enable effective training on diverse data sources, we present a unified training strategy that supports co-training across multiple datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that X-SAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of image segmentation benchmarks, highlighting its efficiency for multimodal, pixel-level visual understanding.

| **[SimMLM: A Simple Framework for Multi-modal Learning with Missing Modality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19264v2)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose SimMLM, a simple yet powerful framework for multimodal learning with missing modalities. Unlike existing approaches that rely on sophisticated network architectures or complex data imputation techniques, SimMLM provides a generic and effective solution that can adapt to various missing modality scenarios with improved accuracy and robustness. Specifically, SimMLM consists of a generic Dynamic Mixture of Modality Experts (DMoME) architecture, featuring a dynamic, learnable gating mechanism that automatically adjusts each modality's contribution in both full and partial modality settings. A key innovation of SimMLM is the proposed More vs. Fewer (MoFe) ranking loss, which ensures that task accuracy improves or remains stable as more modalities are made available. This aligns the model with an intuitive principle: removing one or more modalities should not increase accuracy. We validate SimMLM on multimodal medical image segmentation (BraTS 2018) and multimodal classification (UPMC Food-101, avMNIST) tasks, where it consistently surpasses competitive methods, demonstrating superior accuracy, interpretability, robustness, and reliability across both complete and missing modality scenarios at test time.</p></details> |  |

Semantic segmentations of important cardiac structures that represent the whole heart are useful to assess patient-specific cardiac morphology and pathology. Furthermore, accurate semantic segmentations can be used to generate cardiac digital twin models which allows e.g. electrophysiological simulation and personalized therapy planning. Even though deep learning-based methods for medical image segmentation achieved great advancements over the last decade, retaining good performance under domain shift -- i.e. when training and test data are sampled from different data distributions -- remains challenging. In order to perform well on domains known at training-time, we employ a (1) balanced joint training approach that utilizes CT and MR data in equal amounts from different source domains. Further, aiming to alleviate domain shift towards domains only encountered at test-time, we rely on (2) strong intensity and spatial augmentation techniques to greatly diversify the available training data. Our proposed whole heart segmentation method, a 5-fold ensemble with our contributions, achieves the best performance for MR data overall and a performance similar to the best performance for CT data when compared to a model trained solely on CT. With 93.33% DSC and 0.8388 mm ASSD for CT and 89.30% DSC and 1.2411 mm ASSD for MR data, our method demonstrates great potential to efficiently obtain accurate semantic segmentations from which patient-specific cardiac twin models can be generated.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the MICCAI Challenge on Comprehensive Analysis and Computing of Real-World Medical Images 2024, 12 pages</p></details> |

Removing the illumination effects and enhancing the quality of such images is crucial for many tasks, such as image segmentation and object detection. In this paper, we propose a variational method for low-light image enhancement based on the Retinex decomposition into illumination, reflectance, and noise components. A color correction pre-processing step is applied to the low-light image, which is then used as the observed input in the decomposition. Moreover, our model integrates a novel nonlocal gradient-type fidelity term designed to preserve structural details. Additionally, we propose an automatic gamma correction module. Building on the proposed variational approach, we extend the model by introducing its deep unfolding counterpart, in which the proximal operators are replaced with learnable networks. We propose cross-attention mechanisms to capture long-range dependencies in both the nonlocal prior of the reflectance and the nonlocal gradient-based constraint. Experimental results demonstrate that both methods compare favorably with several recent and state-of-the-art techniques across different datasets. In particular, despite not relying on learning strategies, the variational model outperforms most deep learning approaches both visually and in terms of quality metrics.</p></details> |  |

Substantial brain lesions in brain imaging exhibit high heterogeneity, with indistinct boundaries between lesion regions and normal brain tissue. Small lesions in single slices are difficult to identify, making the accurate and reproducible segmentation of abnormal regions, as well as their feature description, highly complex. Existing methods have the following limitations: 1) They rely solely on single-modal information for learning, neglecting the multi-modal information commonly used in diagnosis. This hampers the ability to comprehensively acquire brain lesion information from multiple perspectives and prevents the effective integration and utilization of multi-modal data inputs, thereby limiting a holistic understanding of lesions. 2) They are constrained by the amount of data available, leading to low sensitivity to small lesions and difficulty in detecting subtle pathological changes. 3) Current SAM-based models rely on external prompts, which cannot achieve automatic segmentation and, to some extent, affect diagnostic efficiency.To address these issues, we have developed a large-scale fully automated segmentation model specifically designed for brain lesion segmentation, named BrainSegDMLF. This model has the following features: 1) Dynamic Modal Interactive Fusion (DMIF) module that processes and integrates multi-modal data during the encoding process, providing the SAM encoder with more comprehensive modal information. 2) Layer-by-Layer Upsampling Decoder, enabling the model to extract rich low-level and high-level features even with limited data, thereby detecting the presence of small lesions. 3) Automatic segmentation masks, allowing the model to generate lesion masks automatically without requiring manual prompts.</p></details> |  |

However, these methods typically suffer from two major limitations. First, their computational complexity scales quadratically with the input sequences. Second, the feed-forward network (FFN) modules in vanilla Transformers typically rely on fully connected layers, which limits models' ability to capture local contextual information and multiscale features critical for precise semantic segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an efficient medical image segmentation network, named TCSAFormer. The proposed TCSAFormer adopts two key ideas. First, it incorporates a Compressed Attention (CA) module, which combines token compression and pixel-level sparse attention to dynamically focus on the most relevant key-value pairs for each query. This is achieved by pruning globally irrelevant tokens and merging redundant ones, significantly reducing computational complexity while enhancing the model's ability to capture relationships between tokens. Second, it introduces a Dual-Branch Feed-Forward Network (DBFFN) module as a replacement for the standard FFN to capture local contextual features and multiscale information, thereby strengthening the model's feature representation capability. We conduct extensive experiments on three publicly available medical image segmentation datasets: ISIC-2018, CVC-ClinicDB, and Synapse, to evaluate the segmentation performance of TCSAFormer. Experimental results demonstrate that TCSAFormer achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, while maintaining lower computational overhead, thus achieving an optimal trade-off between efficiency and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables; The code is available at https://github.com/XiaZunhui/TCSAFormer</p></details> |

However, mainstream AutoDA methods often encounter two challenges: either the search process is excessively time-consuming, hindering practical application, or the performance is suboptimal due to insufficient policy adaptation during training. To address these issues, we propose Sample-aware RandAugment (SRA), an asymmetric, search-free AutoDA method that dynamically adjusts augmentation policies while maintaining straightforward implementation. SRA incorporates a heuristic scoring module that evaluates the complexity of the original training data, enabling the application of tailored augmentations for each sample. Additionally, an asymmetric augmentation strategy is employed to maximize the potential of this scoring module. In multiple experimental settings, SRA narrows the performance gap between search-based and search-free AutoDA methods, achieving a state-of-the-art Top-1 accuracy of 78.31\% on ImageNet with ResNet-50. Notably, SRA demonstrates good compatibility with existing augmentation pipelines and solid generalization across new tasks, without requiring hyperparameter tuning. The pretrained models leveraging SRA also enhance recognition in downstream object detection tasks. SRA represents a promising step towards simpler, more effective, and practical AutoDA designs applicable to a variety of future tasks.

The proposed framework leverages cloud computing to offload computationally intensive tasks and incorporates a custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) for efficient sensor data acquisition, enabling robust navigation in confined spaces. The system integrates YOLOv11 for object detection, Depth Anything V2 for monocular depth estimation, a PCB equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensors and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and a cloud-based Large Language Model (LLM) for context-aware decision-making. A virtual safety envelope, enforced by calibrated sensor offsets, ensures collision avoidance, while a multithreaded architecture achieves low-latency processing. Enhanced spatial awareness is facilitated by 3D bounding box estimation with Kalman filtering. Experimental results in an indoor testbed demonstrate strong performance, with object detection achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP50) of 0.6, depth estimation Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 7.2 cm, only 16 safety envelope breaches across 42 trials over approximately 11 minutes, and end-to-end system latency below 1 second.

However, existing multi-modal BEV methods commonly suffer from limited input adaptability, constrained modeling capacity, and suboptimal generalization. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchically decoupled Mixture-of-Experts architecture at the functional module level, termed Computing Brain DEvelopment System Mixture-of-Experts (CBDES MoE). CBDES MoE integrates multiple structurally heterogeneous expert networks with a lightweight Self-Attention Router (SAR) gating mechanism, enabling dynamic expert path selection and sparse, input-aware efficient inference. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first modular Mixture-of-Experts framework constructed at the functional module granularity within the autonomous driving domain. Extensive evaluations on the real-world nuScenes dataset demonstrate that CBDES MoE consistently outperforms fixed single-expert baselines in 3D object detection. Compared to the strongest single-expert model, CBDES MoE achieves a 1.6-point increase in mAP and a 4.1-point improvement in NDS, demonstrating the effectiveness and practical advantages of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |

While UAVs offer the ability to navigate through dense environments and varying altitudes, they are limited by battery life, payload capacity, and flight duration, necessitating coordinated ground support. Focusing on heterogeneous navigation, SwarmVLM addresses these limitations by enabling semantic collaboration between UAVs and ground robots through impedance control. The system leverages the Vision Language Model (VLM) and the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to adjust impedance control parameters in response to environmental changes. In this framework, the UAV acts as a leader using Artificial Potential Field (APF) planning for real-time navigation, while the ground robot follows via virtual impedance links with adaptive link topology to avoid collisions with short obstacles. The system demonstrated a 92% success rate across 12 real-world trials. Under optimal lighting conditions, the VLM-RAG framework achieved 8% accuracy in object detection and selection of impedance parameters. The mobile robot prioritized short obstacle avoidance, occasionally resulting in a lateral deviation of up to 50 cm from the UAV path, which showcases safe navigation in a cluttered setting.</p></details> |  |

Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseTem: Boosting the Efficiency of CNN-Based Video Encoders by Exploiting Temporal Continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20790v2)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have become pivotal in the field of video processing and is increasingly critical in practical applications such as autonomous driving and object detection. Although Vision Transformers (ViTs) have demonstrated their power, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) remain a highly efficient and high-performance choice for feature extraction and encoding. However, the intensive computational demands of convolution operations hinder its broader adoption as a video encoder. Given the inherent temporal continuity in video frames, changes between consecutive frames are minimal, allowing for the skipping of redundant computations. This technique, which we term as Diff Computation, presents two primary challenges. First, Diff Computation requires to cache intermediate feature maps to ensure the correctness of non-linear computations, leading to significant memory consumption. Second, the imbalance of sparsity among layers, introduced by Diff Computation, incurs accuracy degradation. To address these issues, we propose a memory-efficient scheduling method to eliminate memory overhead and an online adjustment mechanism to minimize accuracy degradation. We integrate these techniques into our framework, SparseTem, to seamlessly support various CNN-based video encoders. SparseTem achieves speedup of 1.79x for EfficientDet and 4.72x for CRNN, with minimal accuracy drop and no additional memory overhead. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SparseTem sets a new state-of-the-art by effectively utilizing temporal continuity to accelerate CNN-based video encoders.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures |

Despite their importance, publicly available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model (LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex real-world domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Customized Knowledge Distillation for Chip-Level Dense Image Predictions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13174v5)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It has been revealed that efficient dense image prediction (EDIP) models designed for AI chips, trained using the knowledge distillation (KD) framework, encounter two key challenges, including \emph{maintaining boundary region completeness} and \emph{ensuring target region connectivity}, despite their favorable real-time capacity to recognize the main object regions. In this work, we propose a customized boundary and context knowledge distillation (BCKD) method for EDIPs, which facilitates the targeted KD from large accurate teacher models to compact small student models. Specifically, the \emph{boundary distillation} focuses on extracting explicit object-level boundaries from the hierarchical feature maps to enhance the student model's mask quality in boundary regions. Meanwhile, the \emph{context distillation} leverages self-relations as a bridge to transfer implicit pixel-level contexts from the teacher model to the student model, ensuring strong connectivity in target regions. Our proposed method is specifically designed for the EDIP tasks and is characterized by its simplicity and efficiency. Theoretical analysis and extensive experimental results across semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation on five representative datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of BCKD, resulting in well-defined object boundaries and smooth connecting regions.</p></details> | under submission |

Such limitation further restricts the model's potential to achieve nuanced visual and language referring in domains such as GUI Agents, counting, \textit{etc}. To address this issue, we introduce a unified high-resolution generalist model, Griffon v2, enabling flexible object referring with visual and textual prompts. To efficiently scale up image resolution, we design a simple and lightweight down-sampling projector to overcome the input tokens constraint in Large Language Models. This design inherently preserves the complete contexts and fine details and significantly improves multimodal perception ability, especially for small objects. Building upon this, we further equip the model with visual-language co-referring capabilities through a plug-and-play visual tokenizer. It enables user-friendly interaction with flexible target images, free-form texts, and even coordinates. Experiments demonstrate that Griffon v2 can localize objects of interest with visual and textual referring, achieve state-of-the-art performance on REC and phrase grounding, and outperform expert models in object detection, object counting, and REG.

| **[Enhancing Egocentric Object Detection in Static Environments using Graph-based Spatial Anomaly Detection and Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07624v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many real-world applications involving static environments, the spatial layout of objects remains consistent across instances. However, state-of-the-art object detection models often fail to leverage this spatial prior, resulting in inconsistent predictions, missed detections, or misclassifications, particularly in cluttered or occluded scenes. In this work, we propose a graph-based post-processing pipeline that explicitly models the spatial relationships between objects to correct detection anomalies in egocentric frames. Using a graph neural network (GNN) trained on manually annotated data, our model identifies invalid object class labels and predicts corrected class labels based on their neighbourhood context. We evaluate our approach both as a standalone anomaly detection and correction framework and as a post-processing module for standard object detectors such as YOLOv7 and RT-DETR. Experiments demonstrate that incorporating this spatial reasoning significantly improves detection performance, with mAP@50 gains of up to 4%. This method highlights the potential of leveraging the environment's spatial structure to improve reliability in object detection systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents GAPNet, a lightweight network built on the granularity-aware paradigm for both image and video SOD. We assign saliency maps of different granularities to supervise the multi-scale decoder side-outputs: coarse object locations for high-level outputs and fine-grained object boundaries for low-level outputs. Specifically, our decoder is built with granularity-aware connections which fuse high-level features of low granularity and low-level features of high granularity, respectively. To support these connections, we design granular pyramid convolution (GPC) and cross-scale attention (CSA) modules for efficient fusion of low-scale and high-scale features, respectively. On top of the encoder, a self-attention module is built to learn global information, enabling accurate object localization with negligible computational cost. Unlike traditional U-Net-based approaches, our proposed method optimizes feature utilization and semantic interpretation while applying appropriate supervision at each processing stage. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art performance among lightweight image and video SOD models.

However, the lack of explicit supervision signals for intermediate functional modules leads to opaque operational mechanisms and limited interpretability, making it challenging for traditional methods to independently evaluate and train these modules. Pioneering in the issue, this study builds upon the feature map-truth representation similarity-based evaluation framework and proposes an independent evaluation method based on Feature Map Convergence Score (FMCS). A Dual-Granularity Dynamic Weighted Scoring System (DG-DWSS) is constructed, formulating a unified quantitative metric - Feature Map Quality Score - to enable comprehensive evaluation of the quality of feature maps generated by functional modules. A CLIP-based Feature Map Quality Evaluation Network (CLIP-FMQE-Net) is further developed, combining feature-truth encoders and quality score prediction heads to enable real-time quality analysis of feature maps generated by functional modules. Experimental results on the NuScenes dataset demonstrate that integrating our evaluation module into the training improves 3D object detection performance, achieving a 3.89 percent gain in NDS. These results verify the effectiveness of our method in enhancing feature representation quality and overall model performance.</p></details> |  |

Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To analyze the safety implications, we superimpose these simulated broken glass effects as image filters on widely used open-source datasets: KITTI and BDD100K using two most prominent object detection neural networks (CNN-based -- YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets. The K-L divergence analysis suggests that these broken glass filters do not introduce significant distributional shifts.</p></details> |  |

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements. Furthermore, it exhibits promising zero-shot scalability when training on more extensive and diverse datasets.

However, most KD methods treat all samples uniformly, overlooking the varying learning value of each sample and thereby limiting their effectiveness. In this paper, we propose Entropy-based Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (EA-KD), a simple yet effective plug-and-play KD method that prioritizes learning from valuable samples. EA-KD quantifies each sample's learning value by strategically combining the entropy of the teacher and student output, then dynamically reweights the distillation loss to place greater emphasis on high-entropy samples. Extensive experiments across diverse KD frameworks and tasks -- including image classification, object detection, and large language model (LLM) distillation -- demonstrate that EA-KD consistently enhances performance, achieving state-of-the-art results with negligible computational cost.

However, achieving this capability in lightweight networks remains challenging due to the trade-off between efficiency and performance. This paper proposes a novel lightweight multi-scale feature extraction layer, termed the LMF layer, which employs depthwise separable dilated convolutions in a fully connected structure. By integrating multiple LMF layers, we develop LMFNet, a lightweight network tailored for salient object detection. Our approach significantly reduces the number of parameters while maintaining competitive performance. Here, we show that LMFNet achieves state-of-the-art or comparable results on five benchmark datasets with only 0.81M parameters, outperforming several traditional and lightweight models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy. Our work not only addresses the challenge of multi-scale learning in lightweight networks but also demonstrates the potential for broader applications in image processing tasks.

Traditional approaches treat detection and forecasting as separate sequential tasks, limiting their ability to leverage temporal cues. ForeSight addresses this limitation with a multi-task streaming and bidirectional learning approach, allowing detection and forecasting to share query memory and propagate information seamlessly. The forecast-aware detection transformer enhances spatial reasoning by integrating trajectory predictions from a multiple hypothesis forecast memory queue, while the streaming forecast transformer improves temporal consistency using past forecasts and refined detections. Unlike tracking-based methods, ForeSight eliminates the need for explicit object association, reducing error propagation with a tracking-free model that efficiently scales across multi-frame sequences. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset show that ForeSight achieves state-of-the-art performance, achieving an EPA of 54.9%, surpassing previous methods by 9.3%, while also attaining the best mAP and minADE among multi-view detection and forecasting models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose MV-CoRe (Multimodal Visual-Conceptual Reasoning), a novel model designed to enhance Complex VQA performance through the deep fusion of diverse visual and linguistic information. MV-CoRe meticulously integrates global embeddings from pre-trained Vision Large Models (VLMs) and Language Large Models (LLMs) with fine-grained semantic-aware visual features, including object detection characteristics and scene graph representations. An innovative Multimodal Fusion Transformer then processes and deeply integrates these diverse feature sets, enabling rich cross-modal attention and facilitating complex reasoning. We evaluate MV-CoRe on challenging Complex VQA benchmarks, including GQA, A-OKVQA, and OKVQA, after training on VQAv2. Our experimental results demonstrate that MV-CoRe consistently outperforms established LVLM baselines, achieving an overall accuracy of 77.5% on GQA. Ablation studies confirm the critical contribution of both object and scene graph features, and human evaluations further validate MV-CoRe's superior factual correctness and reasoning depth, underscoring its robust capabilities for deep visual and conceptual understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, complex weather and illumination pose great challenges to this task. The emergence of large diffusion models has shown promise in achieving reasonable results through learning from 2D priors, but these models are difficult to control and lack robustness. In this paper, we introduce WeatherDiffusion, a diffusion-based framework for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with various weather and lighting conditions. Our method enables authentic estimation of material properties, scene geometry, and lighting, and further supports controllable weather and illumination editing through the use of predicted intrinsic maps guided by text descriptions. We observe that different intrinsic maps should correspond to different regions of the original image. Based on this observation, we propose Intrinsic map-aware attention (MAA) to enable high-quality inverse rendering. Additionally, we introduce a synthetic dataset (\ie WeatherSynthetic) and a real-world dataset (\ie WeatherReal) for forward and inverse rendering on AD scenes with diverse weather and lighting. Extensive experiments show that our WeatherDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks. Moreover, our method demonstrates significant value in downstream tasks for AD, enhancing the robustness of object detection and image segmentation in challenging weather scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary perception, their utility for fine-grained intent reasoning remains underexplored. Notably, no existing benchmark evaluates multi-class intent prediction in safety-critical situations, To address this gap, we introduce DRAMA-X, a fine-grained benchmark constructed from the DRAMA dataset via an automated annotation pipeline. DRAMA-X contains 5,686 accident-prone frames labeled with object bounding boxes, a nine-class directional intent taxonomy, binary risk scores, expert-generated action suggestions for the ego vehicle, and descriptive motion summaries. These annotations enable a structured evaluation of four interrelated tasks central to autonomous decision-making: object detection, intent prediction, risk assessment, and action suggestion. As a reference baseline, we propose SGG-Intent, a lightweight, training-free framework that mirrors the ego vehicle's reasoning pipeline. It sequentially generates a scene graph from visual input using VLM-backed detectors, infers intent, assesses risk, and recommends an action using a compositional reasoning stage powered by a large language model. We evaluate a range of recent VLMs, comparing performance across all four DRAMA-X tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that scene-graph-based reasoning enhances intent prediction and risk assessment, especially when contextual cues are explicitly modeled.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 5 figures, Preprint under review.

However, this research field suffers from both limited public datasets (mostly comprising <2K images with only mono-category objects) and inaccessible source code. To tackle these challenges, we establish a new benchmark dataset and an open-source method for large-scale SAR object detection. Our dataset, SARDet-100K, is a result of intense surveying, collecting, and standardizing 10 existing SAR detection datasets, providing a large-scale and diverse dataset for research purposes. To the best of our knowledge, SARDet-100K is the first COCO-level large-scale multi-class SAR object detection dataset ever created. With this high-quality dataset, we conducted comprehensive experiments and uncovered a crucial challenge in SAR object detection: the substantial disparities between the pretraining on RGB datasets and finetuning on SAR datasets in terms of both data domain and model structure. To bridge these gaps, we propose a novel Multi-Stage with Filter Augmentation (MSFA) pretraining framework that tackles the problems from the perspective of data input, domain transition, and model migration. The proposed MSFA method significantly enhances the performance of SAR object detection models while demonstrating exceptional generalizability and flexibility across diverse models.

While a considerable amount of research has been dedicated to remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation, most of these studies have overlooked the valuable prior knowledge embedded within remote sensing scenarios. Such prior knowledge can be useful because remote sensing objects may be mistakenly recognized without referencing a sufficiently long-range context, which can vary for different objects. This paper considers these priors and proposes a lightweight Large Selective Kernel Network (LSKNet) backbone. LSKNet can dynamically adjust its large spatial receptive field to better model the ranging context of various objects in remote sensing scenarios. To our knowledge, large and selective kernel mechanisms have not been previously explored in remote sensing images. Without bells and whistles, our lightweight LSKNet sets new state-of-the-art scores on standard remote sensing classification, object detection and semantic segmentation benchmarks.

| **[Distribution-Specific Learning for Joint Salient and Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06063v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD) and camouflaged object detection (COD) are two closely related but distinct computer vision tasks. Although both are class-agnostic segmentation tasks that map from RGB space to binary space, the former aims to identify the most salient objects in the image, while the latter focuses on detecting perfectly camouflaged objects that blend into the background in the image. These two tasks exhibit strong contradictory attributes. Previous works have mostly believed that joint learning of these two tasks would confuse the network, reducing its performance on both tasks. However, here we present an opposite perspective: with the correct approach to learning, the network can simultaneously possess the capability to find both salient and camouflaged objects, allowing both tasks to benefit from joint learning. We propose SCJoint, a joint learning scheme for SOD and COD tasks, assuming that the decoding processes of SOD and COD have different distribution characteristics. The key to our method is to learn the respective means and variances of the decoding processes for both tasks by inserting a minimal amount of task-specific learnable parameters within a fully shared network structure, thereby decoupling the contradictory attributes of the two tasks at a minimal cost. Furthermore, we propose a saliency-based sampling strategy (SBSS) to sample the training set of the SOD task to balance the training set sizes of the two tasks. In addition, SBSS improves the training set quality and shortens the training time. Based on the proposed SCJoint and SBSS, we train a powerful generalist network, named JoNet, which has the ability to simultaneously capture both ``salient" and ``camouflaged". Extensive experiments demonstrate the competitive performance and effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/linuxsino/JoNet.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods suffer from inefficient feature leverage and high computational costs due to redundant feature processing and rigid query allocation. To address these challenges, we propose Dome-DETR, a novel framework with Density-Oriented Feature-Query Manipulation for Efficient Tiny Object Detection. To reduce feature redundancies, we introduce a lightweight Density-Focal Extractor (DeFE) to produce clustered compact foreground masks. Leveraging these masks, we incorporate Masked Window Attention Sparsification (MWAS) to focus computational resources on the most informative regions via sparse attention. Besides, we propose Progressive Adaptive Query Initialization (PAQI), which adaptively modulates query density across spatial areas for better query allocation.

This in turn has led to a lack of research into machine understanding for low-light images and (in particular) videos. A common approach is to apply annotations obtained from high quality datasets to synthetically created low light versions. In addition, these approaches are often limited through the use of unrealistic noise models. In this paper, we propose a new Degradation Estimation Network (DEN), which synthetically generates realistic standard RGB (sRGB) noise without the requirement for camera metadata. This is achieved by estimating the parameters of physics-informed noise distributions, trained in a self-supervised manner. This zero-shot approach allows our method to generate synthetic noisy content with a diverse range of realistic noise characteristics, unlike other methods which focus on recreating the noise characteristics of the training data. We evaluate our proposed synthetic pipeline using various methods trained on its synthetic data for typical low-light tasks including synthetic noise replication, video enhancement, and object detection, showing improvements of up to 24\% KLD, 21\% LPIPS, and 62\% AP$_{50-95}$, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Textual Inversion for Efficient Adaptation of Open-Vocabulary Object Detectors Without Forgetting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05323v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) has reached state-of-the-art performance on several object detection benchmarks and boasts strong zero-shot capabilities, but for optimal performance on specific targets some form of finetuning is still necessary. While the initial VLM weights allow for great few-shot transfer learning, this usually involves the loss of the original natural language querying and zero-shot capabilities. Inspired by the success of Textual Inversion (TI) in personalizing text-to-image diffusion models, we propose a similar formulation for open-vocabulary object detection. TI allows extending the VLM vocabulary by learning new or improving existing tokens to accurately detect novel or fine-grained objects from as little as three examples. The learned tokens are completely compatible with the original VLM weights while keeping them frozen, retaining the original model's benchmark performance, and leveraging its existing capabilities such as zero-shot domain transfer (e.g., detecting a sketch of an object after training only on real photos). The storage and gradient calculations are limited to the token embedding dimension, requiring significantly less compute than full-model fine-tuning. We evaluated whether the method matches or outperforms the baseline methods that suffer from forgetting in a wide variety of quantitative and qualitative experiments.</p></details> |  |

Concurrently, many efficient architectures have emerged that have performance comparable to that of larger models on in-domain benchmarks. However, we observe that for smaller models, the performance drop on out-of-distribution (OOD) data is disproportionately larger, indicating a deficiency in the generalization performance of existing efficient models. To address this, we identify key architectural bottlenecks and inappropriate design choices that contribute to this issue, retaining robustness for smaller models. To restore the global field of pure window attention, we further introduce a Coordinator-patch Cross Attention (CoCA) mechanism, featuring dynamic, domain-aware global tokens that enhance local-global feature modeling and adaptively capture robust patterns across domains with minimal computational overhead. Integrating these advancements, we present CoCAViT, a novel visual backbone designed for robust real-time visual representation. Extensive experiments empirically validate our design. At a resolution of 224*224, CoCAViT-28M achieves 84.0% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, with significant gains on multiple OOD benchmarks, compared to competing models. It also attains 52.2 mAP on COCO object detection and 51.3 mIOU on ADE20K semantic segmentation, while maintaining low latency.</p></details> |  |

To tackle this challenge, we propose EarthSynth, a diffusion-based generative foundation model that enables synthesizing multi-category, cross-satellite labeled Earth observation for downstream RSI interpretation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, EarthSynth is the first to explore multi-task generation for remote sensing, tackling the challenge of limited generalization in task-oriented synthesis for RSI interpretation. EarthSynth, trained on the EarthSynth-180K dataset, employs the Counterfactual Composition training strategy with a three-dimensional batch-sample selection mechanism to improve training data diversity and enhance category control. Furthermore, a rule-based method of R-Filter is proposed to filter more informative synthetic data for downstream tasks. We evaluate our EarthSynth on scene classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation in open-world scenarios. There are significant improvements in open-vocabulary understanding tasks, offering a practical solution for advancing RSI interpretation.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, MLLMs are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly adversarial patch attacks, which can pose serious threats in real-world scenarios. Existing patch-based attack methods are primarily designed for object detection models and perform poorly when transferred to MLLM-based systems due to the latter's complex architectures and reasoning abilities. To address these limitations, we propose PhysPatch, a physically realizable and transferable adversarial patch framework tailored for MLLM-based AD systems. PhysPatch jointly optimizes patch location, shape, and content to enhance attack effectiveness and real-world applicability. It introduces a semantic-based mask initialization strategy for realistic placement, an SVD-based local alignment loss with patch-guided crop-resize to improve transferability, and a potential field-based mask refinement method. Extensive experiments across open-source, commercial, and reasoning-capable MLLMs demonstrate that PhysPatch significantly outperforms prior methods in steering MLLM-based AD systems toward target-aligned perception and planning outputs. Moreover, PhysPatch consistently places adversarial patches in physically feasible regions of AD scenes, ensuring strong real-world applicability and deployability.</p></details> |  |

| **[SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08219v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[GRASPTrack: Geometry-Reasoned Association via Segmentation and Projection for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08117v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Trackers Date Fish: A Benchmark and Framework for Underwater Multiple Fish Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06400v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple object tracking (MOT) technology has made significant progress in terrestrial applications, but underwater tracking scenarios remain underexplored despite their importance to marine ecology and aquaculture. In this paper, we present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear swimming patterns of fish and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios. The dataset and codes are released at https://vranlee.github.io/SU-T/.</p></details> |  |
| **[SUIT: Spatial-Spectral Union-Intersection Interaction Network for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07250v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code, trained models and results will be publicly available via https://github.com/bearshng/suit to support reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Street Gaussians without 3D Object Tracker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05548v3)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic scene reconstruction in driving scenarios poses significant challenges due to fast-moving objects. Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS methods still struggle under real-world complexities.

| **[Head Anchor Enhanced Detection and Association for Crowded Pedestrian Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05514v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual pedestrian tracking represents a promising research field, with extensive applications in intelligent surveillance, behavior analysis, and human-computer interaction. However, real-world applications face significant occlusion challenges. When multiple pedestrians interact or overlap, the loss of target features severely compromises the tracker's ability to maintain stable trajectories. Traditional tracking methods, which typically rely on full-body bounding box features extracted from {Re-ID} models and linear constant-velocity motion assumptions, often struggle in severe occlusion scenarios. To address these limitations, this work proposes an enhanced tracking framework that leverages richer feature representations and a more robust motion model. Specifically, the proposed method incorporates detection features from both the regression and classification branches of an object detector, embedding spatial and positional information directly into the feature representations. To further mitigate occlusion challenges, a head keypoint detection model is introduced, as the head is less prone to occlusion compared to the full body. In terms of motion modeling, we propose an iterative Kalman filtering approach designed to align with modern detector assumptions, integrating 3D priors to better complete motion trajectories in complex scenes. By combining these advancements in appearance and motion modeling, the proposed method offers a more robust solution for multi-object tracking in crowded environments where occlusions are prevalent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-tracklet Tracking for Generic Targets with Adaptive Detection Clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05172v1)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking specific targets, such as pedestrians and vehicles, has been the focus of recent vision-based multitarget tracking studies. However, in some real-world scenarios, unseen categories often challenge existing methods due to low-confidence detections, weak motion and appearance constraints, and long-term occlusions. To address these issues, this article proposes a tracklet-enhanced tracker called Multi-Tracklet Tracking (MTT) that integrates flexible tracklet generation into a multi-tracklet association framework. This framework first adaptively clusters the detection results according to their short-term spatio-temporal correlation into robust tracklets and then estimates the best tracklet partitions using multiple clues, such as location and appearance over time to mitigate error propagation in long-term association. Finally, extensive experiments on the benchmark for generic multiple object tracking demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

Existing systems predominantly rely on body gestures or speech to control visualizations, leaving interactions with physical objects largely underexplored. We introduce augmented physical data storytelling, an approach enabling presenters to manipulate visualizations through physical object interactions. To inform this approach, we first conducted a survey of data-driven presentations to identify common visualization commands. We then conducted workshops with nine HCI/VIS researchers to collect mappings between physical manipulations and these commands. Guided by these insights, we developed InSituTale, a prototype that combines object tracking via a depth camera with Vision-LLM for detecting real-world events. Through physical manipulations, presenters can dynamically execute various visualization commands, delivering cohesive data storytelling experiences that blend physical and digital elements. A user study with 12 participants demonstrated that InSituTale enables intuitive interactions, offers high utility, and facilitates an engaging presentation experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Term Visual Object Tracking with Event Cameras: An Associative Memory Augmented Tracker and A Benchmark Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05839v3)** | 2025-08-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing event stream based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term, large-scale frame-event visual object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 1,044 long-term videos that involve 1.9 million RGB frames and event stream pairs, 60 different target objects, and 14 challenging attributes. To build a solid benchmark, we retrain and evaluate 21 baseline trackers on our dataset for future work to compare. In addition, we propose a novel Associative Memory Transformer based RGB-Event long-term visual tracker, termed AMTTrack. It follows a one-stream tracking framework and aggregates the multi-scale RGB/event template and search tokens effectively via the Hopfield retrieval layer. The framework also embodies another aspect of associative memory by maintaining dynamic template representations through an associative memory update scheme, which addresses the appearance variation in long-term tracking. Extensive experiments on FELT, FE108, VisEvent, and COESOT datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed tracker. Both the dataset and source code will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/FELT_SOT_Benchmark</p></details> | <details><summary>FELT ...</summary><p>FELT v2 benchmark dataset and a new Modern Hopfield Network based Tracker</p></details> |

We present Constraint-Preserving Data Generation (CP-Gen), a method that uses a single expert trajectory to generate robot demonstrations containing novel object geometries and poses. These generated demonstrations are used to train closed-loop visuomotor policies that transfer zero-shot to the real world and generalize across variations in object geometries and poses. Similar to prior work using pose variations for data generation, CP-Gen first decomposes expert demonstrations into free-space motions and robot skills. But unlike those works, we achieve geometry-aware data generation by formulating robot skills as keypoint-trajectory constraints: keypoints on the robot or grasped object must track a reference trajectory defined relative to a task-relevant object. To generate a new demonstration, CP-Gen samples pose and geometry transforms for each task-relevant object, then applies these transforms to the object and its associated keypoints or keypoint trajectories. We optimize robot joint configurations so that the keypoints on the robot or grasped object track the transformed keypoint trajectory, and then motion plan a collision-free path to the first optimized joint configuration. Experiments on 16 simulation tasks and four real-world tasks, featuring multi-stage, non-prehensile and tight-tolerance manipulation, show that policies trained using CP-Gen achieve an average success rate of 77%, outperforming the best baseline that achieves an average of 50%.</p></details> | <details><summary>CoRL ...</summary><p>CoRL 2025.

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

While current approaches leveraging neural radiance fields or Gaussian Splatting have achieved fine-grained reconstruction and high-fidelity novel view synthesis, they still face significant limitations. These often stem from a dependence on pre-calibrated object tracks or difficulties in accurately modeling fast-moving objects from undersampled capture, particularly due to challenges in handling temporal discontinuities. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel video diffusion-enhanced 4D Gaussian Splatting framework. Our key insight is to distill robust, temporally consistent priors from a test-time adapted video diffusion model. To ensure precise pose alignment and effective integration of this denoised content, we introduce two core innovations: a joint timestamp optimization strategy that refines interpolated frame poses, and an uncertainty distillation method that adaptively extracts target content while preserving well-reconstructed regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances dynamic modeling, especially for fast-moving objects, achieving an approximate PSNR gain of 2 dB for novel view synthesis over baseline approaches.</p></details> |  |

Manual observation and frequent assessments are laborious and inconsistent for activity monitoring. In this study, we developed a unique multi-camera, real-time tracking system for indoor-housed Holstein Friesian dairy cows. This technology uses cutting-edge computer vision techniques, including instance segmentation and tracking algorithms to monitor cow activity seamlessly and accurately. An integrated top-down barn panorama was created by geometrically aligning six camera feeds using homographic transformations. The detection phase used a refined YOLO11-m model trained on an overhead cow dataset, obtaining high accuracy (mAP\@0.50 = 0.97, F1 = 0.95). SAMURAI, an upgraded Segment Anything Model 2.1, generated pixel-precise cow masks for instance segmentation utilizing zero-shot learning and motion-aware memory. Even with occlusion and fluctuating posture, a motion-aware Linear Kalman filter and IoU-based data association reliably identified cows over time for object tracking. The proposed system significantly outperformed Deep SORT Realtime. Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy (MOTA) was 98.7% and 99.3% in two benchmark video sequences, with IDF1 scores above 99% and near-zero identity switches. This unified multi-camera system can track dairy cows in complex interior surroundings in real time, according to our data. The system reduces redundant detections across overlapping cameras, maintains continuity as cows move between viewpoints, with the aim of improving early sickness prediction through activity quantification and behavioural classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted in Smart Agriculture Technology</p></details> |

In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lessons Learned from the Real-World Deployment of Multi-Sensor Fusion for Proactive Work Zone Safety Application](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01599v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Proactive safety systems that anticipate and mitigate traffic risks before incidents occur are increasingly recognized as essential for improving work zone safety. Unlike traditional reactive methods, these systems rely on real-time sensing, trajectory prediction, and intelligent infrastructure to detect potential hazards. Existing simulation-based studies often overlook, and real-world deployment studies rarely discuss the practical challenges associated with deploying such systems in operational settings, particularly those involving roadside infrastructure and multi-sensor integration and fusion. This study addresses that gap by presenting deployment insights and technical lessons learned from a real-world implementation of a multi-sensor safety system at an active bridge repair work zone along the N-2/US-75 corridor in Lincoln, Nebraska. The deployed system combines LiDAR, radar, and camera sensors with an edge computing platform to support multi-modal object tracking, trajectory fusion, and real-time analytics. Specifically, this study presents key lessons learned across three critical stages of deployment: (1) sensor selection and placement, (2) sensor calibration, system integration, and validation, and (3) sensor fusion. Additionally, we propose a predictive digital twin framework that leverages fused trajectory data for early conflict detection and real-time warning generation, enabling proactive safety interventions.</p></details> |  |

Classical closed-vocabulary MOT (CV-MOT) methods aim to track objects of predefined categories. Recently, some open-vocabulary MOT (OV-MOT) methods have successfully addressed the problem of tracking unknown categories. However, we found that the CV-MOT and OV-MOT methods each struggle to excel in the tasks of the other. In this paper, we present a unified framework, Associate Everything Detected (AED), that simultaneously tackles CV-MOT and OV-MOT by integrating with any off-the-shelf detector and supports unknown categories. Different from existing tracking-by-detection MOT methods, AED gets rid of prior knowledge (e.g. motion cues) and relies solely on highly robust feature learning to handle complex trajectories in OV-MOT tasks while keeping excellent performance in CV-MOT tasks. Specifically, we model the association task as a similarity decoding problem and propose a sim-decoder with an association-centric learning mechanism. The sim-decoder calculates similarities in three aspects: spatial, temporal, and cross-clip. Subsequently, association-centric learning leverages these threefold similarities to ensure that the extracted features are appropriate for continuous tracking and robust enough to generalize to unknown categories. Compared with existing powerful OV-MOT and CV-MOT methods, AED achieves superior performance on TAO, SportsMOT, and DanceTrack without any prior knowledge.

However, conventional tracking-by-detection methods typically rely on static coordinate transformations based on ego-vehicle poses, disregarding ego-vehicle speed-induced variations in observation noise and reference frame changes, which degrades tracking stability and accuracy in dynamic, high-speed scenarios. In this paper, we investigate the critical role of ego-vehicle speed in MOT and propose a Speed-Guided Learnable Kalman Filter (SG-LKF) that dynamically adapts uncertainty modeling to ego-vehicle speed, significantly improving stability and accuracy in highly dynamic scenarios. Central to SG-LKF is MotionScaleNet (MSNet), a decoupled token-mixing and channel-mixing MLP that adaptively predicts key parameters of SG-LKF. To enhance inter-frame association and trajectory continuity, we introduce a self-supervised trajectory consistency loss jointly optimized with semantic and positional constraints. Extensive experiments show that SG-LKF ranks first among all vision-based methods on KITTI 2D MOT with 79.59% HOTA, delivers strong results on KITTI 3D MOT with 82.03% HOTA, and outperforms SimpleTrack by 2.2% AMOTA on nuScenes 3D MOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust Semantic Correspondence: A Benchmark and Insights](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00272v1)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic correspondence aims to identify semantically meaningful relationships between different images and is a fundamental challenge in computer vision. It forms the foundation for numerous tasks such as 3D reconstruction, object tracking, and image editing. With the progress of large-scale vision models, semantic correspondence has achieved remarkable performance in controlled and high-quality conditions. However, the robustness of semantic correspondence in challenging scenarios is much less investigated. In this work, we establish a novel benchmark for evaluating semantic correspondence in adverse conditions. The benchmark dataset comprises 14 distinct challenging scenarios that reflect commonly encountered imaging issues, including geometric distortion, image blurring, digital artifacts, and environmental occlusion. Through extensive evaluations, we provide several key insights into the robustness of semantic correspondence approaches: (1) All existing methods suffer from noticeable performance drops under adverse conditions; (2) Using large-scale vision models can enhance overall robustness, but fine-tuning on these models leads to a decline in relative robustness; (3) The DINO model outperforms the Stable Diffusion in relative robustness, and their fusion achieves better absolute robustness; Moreover, We evaluate common robustness enhancement strategies for semantic correspondence and find that general data augmentations are ineffective, highlighting the need for task-specific designs. These results are consistent across both our dataset and real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[YOLOO: You Only Learn from Others Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00618v2)** | 2025-08-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) typically necessitates extensive computational costs of deep neural networks (DNNs) to extract multi-modal representations. In this paper, we propose an intriguing question: May we learn from multiple modalities only during training to avoid multi-modal input in the inference phase? To answer it, we propose \textbf{YOLOO}, a novel multi-modal 3D MOT paradigm: You Only Learn from Others Once. YOLOO empowers the point cloud encoder to learn a unified tri-modal representation (UTR) from point clouds and other modalities, such as images and textual cues, all at once. Leveraging this UTR, YOLOO achieves efficient tracking solely using the point cloud encoder without compromising its performance, fundamentally obviating the need for computationally intensive DNNs. Specifically, YOLOO includes two core components: a unified tri-modal encoder (UTEnc) and a flexible geometric constraint (F-GC) module. UTEnc integrates a point cloud encoder with image and text encoders adapted from pre-trained CLIP. It seamlessly fuses point cloud information with rich visual-textual knowledge from CLIP into the point cloud encoder, yielding highly discriminative UTRs that facilitate the association between trajectories and detections. Additionally, F-GC filters out mismatched associations with similar representations but significant positional discrepancies. It further enhances the robustness of UTRs without requiring any scene-specific tuning, addressing a key limitation of customized geometric constraints (e.g., 3D IoU). Lastly, high-quality 3D trajectories are generated by a traditional data association component. By integrating these advancements into a multi-modal 3D MOT scheme, our YOLOO achieves substantial gains in both robustness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, existing UAV tracking datasets predominantly feature conspicuous objects and lack diversity in scene complexity and attribute representation, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios. To overcome these limitations, we present the CST Anti-UAV, a new thermal infrared dataset specifically designed for Single Object Tracking (SOT) in Complex Scenes with Tiny UAVs (CST). It contains 220 video sequences with over 240k high-quality bounding box annotations, highlighting two key properties: a significant number of tiny-sized UAV targets and the diverse and complex scenes. To the best of our knowledge, CST Anti-UAV is the first dataset to incorporate complete manual frame-level attribute annotations, enabling precise evaluations under varied challenges. To conduct an in-depth performance analysis for CST Anti-UAV, we evaluate 20 existing SOT methods on the proposed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that tracking tiny UAVs in complex environments remains a challenge, as the state-of-the-art method achieves only 35.92% state accuracy, much lower than the 67.69% observed on the Anti-UAV410 dataset. These findings underscore the limitations of existing benchmarks and the need for further advancements in UAV tracking research. The CST Anti-UAV benchmark is about to be publicly released, which not only fosters the development of more robust SOT methods but also drives innovation in anti-UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCVW2025</p></details> |

Over the past two decades, a wide range of tracking paradigms, including Siamese-based trackers, discriminative trackers, and, more recently, prominent transformer-based approaches, have been introduced to address these challenges. While a few existing survey papers in this field have either concentrated on a single category or widely covered multiple ones to capture progress, our paper presents a comprehensive review of all three categories, with particular emphasis on the rapidly evolving transformer-based methods. We analyze the core design principles, innovations, and limitations of each approach through both qualitative and quantitative comparisons. Our study introduces a novel categorization and offers a unified visual and tabular comparison of representative methods. Additionally, we organize existing trackers from multiple perspectives and summarize the major evaluation benchmarks, highlighting the fast-paced advancements in transformer-based tracking driven by their robust spatio-temporal modeling capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>55 pa...</summary><p>55 pages, 29 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Existing approaches often struggle to balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments. In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing methods, with 40% faster inference time.</p></details> |  |
| **[FastTrackTr:Towards Fast Multi-Object Tracking with Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15811v4)** | 2025-07-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have captured the attention of many researchers in recent years. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds due to their structure or other issues. To address this problem, we revisited the Joint Detection and Tracking (JDT) method by looking back at past approaches. By integrating the original JDT approach with some advanced theories, this paper employs an efficient method of information transfer between frames on the DETR, constructing a fast and novel JDT-type MOT framework: FastTrackTr. Thanks to the superiority of this information transfer method, our approach not only reduces the number of queries required during tracking but also avoids the excessive introduction of network structures, ensuring model simplicity. Experimental results indicate that our method has the potential to achieve real-time tracking and exhibits competitive tracking accuracy across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAMITE: Position Prompted SAM2 with Calibrated Memory for Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21732v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual Object Tracking (VOT) is widely used in applications like autonomous driving to continuously track targets in videos. Existing methods can be roughly categorized into template matching and autoregressive methods, where the former usually neglects the temporal dependencies across frames and the latter tends to get biased towards the object categories during training, showing weak generalizability to unseen classes. To address these issues, some methods propose to adapt the video foundation model SAM2 for VOT, where the tracking results of each frame would be encoded as memory for conditioning the rest of frames in an autoregressive manner. Nevertheless, existing methods fail to overcome the challenges of object occlusions and distractions, and do not have any measures to intercept the propagation of tracking errors. To tackle them, we present a SAMITE model, built upon SAM2 with additional modules, including: (1) Prototypical Memory Bank: We propose to quantify the feature-wise and position-wise correctness of each frame's tracking results, and select the best frames to condition subsequent frames. As the features of occluded and distracting objects are feature-wise and position-wise inaccurate, their scores would naturally be lower and thus can be filtered to intercept error propagation; (2) Positional Prompt Generator: To further reduce the impacts of distractors, we propose to generate positional mask prompts to provide explicit positional clues for the target, leading to more accurate tracking. Extensive experiments have been conducted on six benchmarks, showing the superiority of SAMITE. The code is available at https://github.com/Sam1224/SAMITE.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Angular-Temporal Interaction Network for Light Field Object Tracking in Low-Light Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21460v1)** | 2025-07-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality 4D light field representation with efficient angular feature modeling is crucial for scene perception, as it can provide discriminative spatial-angular cues to identify moving targets. However, recent developments still struggle to deliver reliable angular modeling in the temporal domain, particularly in complex low-light scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel light field epipolar-plane structure image (ESI) representation that explicitly defines the geometric structure within the light field. By capitalizing on the abrupt changes in the angles of light rays within the epipolar plane, this representation can enhance visual expression in low-light scenes and reduce redundancy in high-dimensional light fields. We further propose an angular-temporal interaction network (ATINet) for light field object tracking that learns angular-aware representations from the geometric structural cues and angular-temporal interaction cues of light fields. Furthermore, ATINet can also be optimized in a self-supervised manner to enhance the geometric feature interaction across the temporal domain. Finally, we introduce a large-scale light field low-light dataset for object tracking. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that ATINet achieves state-of-the-art performance in single object tracking. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to multiple object tracking, which also shows the effectiveness of high-quality light field angular-temporal modeling.</p></details> |  |

Recent one-step Real-ISR models typically inject a Low-Quality (LQ) image latent distribution at the initial timestep. However, a fundamental gap exists between the LQ image latent distribution and the Gaussian noisy latent distribution, limiting the effective utilization of generative priors. We observe that the noisy latent distribution at DDPM/FM mid-timesteps aligns more closely with the LQ image latent distribution. Based on this insight, we present One Mid-timestep Guidance Real-ISR (OMGSR), a universal framework applicable to DDPM/FM-based generative models. OMGSR injects the LQ image latent distribution at a pre-computed mid-timestep, incorporating the proposed Latent Distribution Refinement loss to alleviate the latent distribution gap. We also design the Overlap-Chunked LPIPS/GAN loss to eliminate checkerboard artifacts in image generation. Within this framework, we instantiate OMGSR for DDPM/FM-based generative models with two variants: OMGSR-S (SD-Turbo) and OMGSR-F (FLUX.1-dev). Experimental results demonstrate that OMGSR-S/F achieves balanced/excellent performance across quantitative and qualitative metrics at 512-resolution. Notably, OMGSR-F establishes overwhelming dominance in all reference metrics. We further train a 1k-resolution OMGSR-F to match the default resolution of FLUX.1-dev, which yields excellent results, especially in the details of the image generation. We also generate 2k-resolution images by the 1k-resolution OMGSR-F using our two-stage Tiled VAE & Diffusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning User Preferences for Image Generation Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08220v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>User preference prediction requires a comprehensive and accurate understanding of individual tastes. This includes both surface-level attributes, such as color and style, and deeper content-related aspects, such as themes and composition. However, existing methods typically rely on general human preferences or assume static user profiles, often neglecting individual variability and the dynamic, multifaceted nature of personal taste. To address these limitations, we propose an approach built upon Multimodal Large Language Models, introducing contrastive preference loss and preference tokens to learn personalized user preferences from historical interactions. The contrastive preference loss is designed to effectively distinguish between user ''likes'' and ''dislikes'', while the learnable preference tokens capture shared interest representations among existing users, enabling the model to activate group-specific preferences and enhance consistency across similar users. Extensive experiments demonstrate our model outperforms other methods in preference prediction accuracy, effectively identifying users with similar aesthetic inclinations and providing more precise guidance for generating images that align with individual tastes.

However, Current data-driven approaches are data-voracious, requiring large, high-quality labeled image datasets, which limits their application in surgical data science. Our Work introduces a novel dynamic Gaussian Splatting technique to address the data scarcity in surgical image datasets. We propose a dynamic Gaussian model to represent dynamic surgical scenes, enabling the rendering of surgical instruments from unseen viewpoints and deformations with real tissue backgrounds. We utilize a dynamic training adjustment strategy to address challenges posed by poorly calibrated camera poses from real-world scenarios. Additionally, we propose a method based on dynamic Gaussians for automatically generating annotations for our synthetic data. For evaluation, we constructed a new dataset featuring seven scenes with 14,000 frames of tool and camera motion and tool jaw articulation, with a background of an ex-vivo porcine model. Using this dataset, we synthetically replicate the scene deformation from the ground truth data, allowing direct comparisons of synthetic image quality. Experimental results illustrate that our method generates photo-realistic labeled image datasets with the highest values in Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (29.87). We further evaluate the performance of medical-specific neural networks trained on real and synthetic images using an unseen real-world image dataset. Our results show that the performance of models trained on synthetic images generated by the proposed method outperforms those trained with state-of-the-art standard data augmentation by 10%, leading to an overall improvement in model performances by nearly 15%.</p></details> | 13 pages, 9 figures |

Existing downstream pre-training models are typically trained on visible images. However, the significant pixel distribution differences between visible and multimodal fusion images can degrade downstream task performance, sometimes even below that of using only visible images. This paper explores adapting multimodal fused images with significant modality differences to object detection and semantic segmentation models trained on visible images. To address this, we propose MambaTrans, a novel multimodal fusion image modality translator. MambaTrans uses descriptions from a multimodal large language model and masks from semantic segmentation models as input. Its core component, the Multi-Model State Space Block, combines mask-image-text cross-attention and a 3D-Selective Scan Module, enhancing pure visual capabilities. By leveraging object detection prior knowledge, MambaTrans minimizes detection loss during training and captures long-term dependencies among text, masks, and images. This enables favorable results in pre-trained models without adjusting their parameters. Experiments on public datasets show that MambaTrans effectively improves multimodal image performance in downstream tasks.</p></details> |  |

However, the quadratic scaling properties of the attention in DiTs hinder image generation with higher resolution or on devices with limited resources. This work introduces an efficient diffusion transformer (EDiT) to alleviate these efficiency bottlenecks in conventional DiTs and Multimodal DiTs (MM-DiTs). First, we present a novel linear compressed attention method that uses a multi-layer convolutional network to modulate queries with local information while keys and values are aggregated spatially. Second, we formulate a hybrid attention scheme for multimodal inputs that combines linear attention for image-to-image interactions and standard scaled dot-product attention for interactions involving prompts. Merging these two approaches leads to an expressive, linear-time Multimodal Efficient Diffusion Transformer (MM-EDiT). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the EDiT and MM-EDiT architectures by integrating them into PixArt-Sigma (conventional DiT) and Stable Diffusion 3.5-Medium (MM-DiT), achieving up to 2.2x speedup with comparable image quality after distillation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods typically rely on additional guidance, such as text prompts or spatial masks, to capture the common target concept. Unfortunately, relying on manually provided guidance can lead to incomplete separation of auxiliary features, which degrades generation quality.In this paper, we propose Contrastive Inversion, a novel approach that identifies the common concept by comparing the input images without relying on additional information. We train the target token along with the image-wise auxiliary text tokens via contrastive learning, which extracts the well-disentangled true semantics of the target. Then we apply disentangled cross-attention fine-tuning to improve concept fidelity without overfitting. Experimental results and analysis demonstrate that our method achieves a balanced, high-level performance in both concept representation and editing, outperforming existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CVPR 2025 workshop (AI4CC)</p></details> |
| **[Grouped Speculative Decoding for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07747v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, autoregressive (AR) image models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities, positioning themselves as a compelling alternative to diffusion models. However, their sequential nature leads to long inference times, limiting their practical scalability. In this work, we introduce Grouped Speculative Decoding (GSD), a novel, training-free acceleration method for AR image models. While recent studies have explored Speculative Decoding (SD) as a means to speed up AR image generation, existing approaches either provide only modest acceleration or require additional training. Our in-depth analysis reveals a fundamental difference between language and image tokens: image tokens exhibit inherent redundancy and diversity, meaning multiple tokens can convey valid semantics. However, traditional SD methods are designed to accept only a single most-likely token, which fails to leverage this difference, leading to excessive false-negative rejections. To address this, we propose a new SD strategy that evaluates clusters of visually valid tokens rather than relying on a single target token. Additionally, we observe that static clustering based on embedding distance is ineffective, which motivates our dynamic GSD approach. Extensive experiments show that GSD accelerates AR image models by an average of 3.7x while preserving image quality-all without requiring any additional training.

Existing image generation methods typically rely on prompts to influence occlusion, which often lack precision. While layout-to-image methods provide control over object locations, they fail to address occlusion relationships explicitly. Given a pre-trained image diffusion model, our method leverages volume rendering principles to "render" the scene in latent space, guided by occlusion relationships and the estimated transmittance of objects. This approach does not require retraining or fine-tuning the image diffusion model, yet it enables accurate occlusion control due to its physics-grounded foundation. In extensive experiments, our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of occlusion accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by adjusting the opacities of objects or concepts during rendering, our method can achieve a variety of effects, such as altering the transparency of objects, the density of mass (e.g., forests), the concentration of particles (e.g., rain, fog), the intensity of light, and the strength of lens effects, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025 (oral).

In this paper, we first introduce the X2Edit Dataset, a comprehensive dataset covering 14 diverse editing tasks, including subject-driven generation. We utilize the industry-leading unified image generation models and expert models to construct the data. Meanwhile, we design reasonable editing instructions with the VLM and implement various scoring mechanisms to filter the data. As a result, we construct 3.7 million high-quality data with balanced categories. Second, to better integrate seamlessly with community image generation models, we design task-aware MoE-LoRA training based on FLUX.1, with only 8\% of the parameters of the full model. To further improve the final performance, we utilize the internal representations of the diffusion model and define positive/negative samples based on image editing types to introduce contrastive learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the model's editing performance is competitive among many excellent models. Additionally, the constructed dataset exhibits substantial advantages over existing open-source datasets.

We introduce SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories. Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.</p></details> |  |

Prior works achieved personalization by merging corresponding low-rank adapters (LoRAs) through optimization-based methods, which are computationally demanding and unsuitable for real-time use on resource-constrained devices like smartphones. To address this, we introduce LoRA$.$rar, a method that not only improves image quality but also achieves a remarkable speedup of over $4000\times$ in the merging process. We collect a dataset of style and subject LoRAs and pre-train a hypernetwork on a diverse set of content-style LoRA pairs, learning an efficient merging strategy that generalizes to new, unseen content-style pairs, enabling fast, high-quality personalization. Moreover, we identify limitations in existing evaluation metrics for content-style quality and propose a new protocol using multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for more accurate assessment. Our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art in both content and style fidelity, as validated by MLLM assessments and human evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Unleashing the Potential of Large Language Models for Text-to-Image Generation through Autoregressive Representation Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07334v3)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Autoregressive Representation Alignment (ARRA), a new training framework that unlocks global-coherent text-to-image generation in autoregressive LLMs without architectural modifications. Different from prior works that require complex architectural redesigns, ARRA aligns LLM's hidden states with visual representations from external visual foundational models via a global visual alignment loss and a hybrid token, [object Object]. This token enforces dual constraints: local next-token prediction and global semantic distillation, enabling LLMs to implicitly learn spatial and contextual coherence while retaining their original autoregressive paradigm. Extensive experiments validate ARRA's plug-and-play versatility. When training T2I LLMs from scratch, ARRA reduces FID by 16.6% (ImageNet), 12.0% (LAION-COCO) for autoregressive LLMs like LlamaGen, without modifying original architecture and inference mechanism. For training from text-generation-only LLMs, ARRA reduces FID by 25.5% (MIMIC-CXR), 8.8% (DeepEyeNet) for advanced LLMs like Chameleon. For domain adaptation, ARRA aligns general-purpose LLMs with specialized models (e.g., BioMedCLIP), achieving an 18.6% FID reduction over direct fine-tuning on medical imaging (MIMIC-CXR). These results demonstrate that training objective redesign, rather than architectural modifications, can resolve cross-modal global coherence challenges. ARRA offers a complementary paradigm for advancing autoregressive models. The code is available at https://github.com/xiexing0916/ARRA.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a cross-linguistic benchmark examining words where grammatical gender contradicts stereotypical gender associations (e.g., ``une sentinelle'' - grammatically feminine in French but referring to the stereotypically masculine concept ``guard''). Our dataset spans five gendered languages (French, Spanish, German, Italian, Russian) and two gender-neutral control languages (English, Chinese), comprising 800 unique prompts that generated 28,800 images across three state-of-the-art T2I models. Our analysis reveals that grammatical gender dramatically influences image generation: masculine grammatical markers increase male representation to 73\% on average (compared to 22\% with gender-neutral English), while feminine grammatical markers increase female representation to 38\% (compared to 28\% in English). These effects vary systematically by language resource availability and model architecture, with high-resource languages showing stronger effects. Our findings establish that language structure itself, not just content, shapes AI-generated visual outputs, introducing a new dimension for understanding bias and fairness in multilingual, multimodal systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward-Directed Score-Based Diffusion Models via q-Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04832v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new reinforcement learning (RL) formulation for training continuous-time score-based diffusion models for generative AI to generate samples that maximize reward functions while keeping the generated distributions close to the unknown target data distributions. Different from most existing studies, ours does not involve any pretrained model for the unknown score functions of the noise-perturbed data distributions, nor does it attempt to learn the score functions. Instead, we formulate the problem as entropy-regularized continuous-time RL and show that the optimal stochastic policy has a Gaussian distribution with a known covariance matrix. Based on this result, we parameterize the mean of Gaussian policies and develop an actor--critic type (little) q-learning algorithm to solve the RL problem. A key ingredient in our algorithm design is to obtain noisy observations from the unknown score function via a ratio estimator. Our formulation can also be adapted to solve pure score-matching and fine-tuning pretrained models. Numerically, we show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its performance with two state-of-the-art RL methods that fine-tune pretrained models on several generative tasks including high-dimensional image generations. Finally, we discuss extensions of our RL formulation to probability flow ODE implementation of diffusion models and to conditional diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoAR: Concept Injection into Autoregressive Models for Personalized Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07341v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unified autoregressive (AR) model excels at multimodal understanding and generation, but its potential for customized image generation remains underexplored. Existing customized generation methods rely on full fine-tuning or adapters, making them costly and prone to overfitting or catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose \textbf{CoAR}, a novel framework for injecting subject concepts into the unified AR models while keeping all pre-trained parameters completely frozen. CoAR learns effective, specific subject representations with only a minimal number of parameters using a Layerwise Multimodal Context Learning strategy. To address overfitting and language drift, we further introduce regularization that preserves the pre-trained distribution and anchors context tokens to improve subject fidelity and re-contextualization. Additionally, CoAR supports training-free subject customization in a user-provided style. Experiments demonstrate that CoAR achieves superior performance on both subject-driven personalization and style personalization, while delivering significant gains in computational and memory efficiency. Notably, CoAR tunes less than \textbf{0.05\%} of the parameters while achieving competitive performance compared to recent Proxy-Tuning. Code: https://github.com/KZF-kzf/CoAR</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing AI-Powered Medical Image Synthesis: Insights from MedVQA-GI Challenge Using CLIP, Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion, and Dream-Booth + LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20667v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The MEDVQA-GI challenge addresses the integration of AI-driven text-to-image generative models in medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance diagnostic capabilities through synthetic image generation. Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p></details> |  |
| **[SketchConcept: Sketching-based Concept Recomposition for Product Design using Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07141v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conceptual product design requires designers to explore the design space of visual and functional concepts simultaneously. Sketching has long been adopted to empower concept exploration. However, current sketch-based design tools mostly emphasize visual design using emerging techniques. We present SketchConcept, a design support tool that decomposes design concepts into visual representations and functionality of concepts using sketches and textual descriptions. We propose a function-to-visual mapping workflow that maps the function descriptions generated by a Large Language Model to a component of the concept produced by image Generative Artificial Intelligence(GenAI). The function-to-visual mapping allows our system to leverage multimodal GenAI to decompose, generate, and edit the design concept to satisfy the overall function and behavior. We present multiple use cases enabled by SketchConcept to validate the workflow. Finally, we evaluated the efficacy and usability of our system with a two-session user study.</p></details> |  |

However, it remains a challenge to precisely control spatial compositions, including object arrangement and scene conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose Canvas3D, an interactive system leveraging a 3D engine to enable precise spatial manipulation for image generation. Upon user prompt, Canvas3D automatically converts textual descriptions into interactive objects within a 3D engine-driven virtual canvas, empowering direct and precise spatial configuration. These user-defined arrangements generate explicit spatial constraints that guide generative models in accurately reflecting user intentions in the resulting images. We conducted a closed-end comparative study between Canvas3D and a baseline system. And an open-ended study to evaluate our system "in the wild". The result indicates that Canvas3D outperforms the baseline on spatial control, interactivity, and overall user experience.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trustworthy Medical Imaging with Large Language Models: A Study of Hallucinations Across Modalities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07031v1)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to medical imaging tasks, including image interpretation and synthetic image generation. However, these models often produce hallucinations, which are confident but incorrect outputs that can mislead clinical decisions. This study examines hallucinations in two directions: image to text, where LLMs generate reports from X-ray, CT, or MRI scans, and text to image, where models create medical images from clinical prompts. We analyze errors such as factual inconsistencies and anatomical inaccuracies, evaluating outputs using expert informed criteria across imaging modalities. Our findings reveal common patterns of hallucination in both interpretive and generative tasks, with implications for clinical reliability. We also discuss factors contributing to these failures, including model architecture and training data. By systematically studying both image understanding and generation, this work provides insights into improving the safety and trustworthiness of LLM driven medical imaging systems.</p></details> |  |
