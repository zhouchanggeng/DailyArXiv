In parallel, large-scale vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition. Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy, significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%) baselines. Our work provides a new, highly efficient baseline for video understanding that effectively bridges the gap between large static models and dynamic, low-cost motion cues. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/microa/MoCLIP-Lite.</p></details> | 6 pages, 3 figures |

While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees. We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Less Precise Be More Reliable? A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> |  |
| **[WAVECLIP: Wavelet Tokenization for Adaptive-Resolution CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21153v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WAVECLIP, a single unified model for adaptive resolution inference in CLIP, enabled by wavelet-based tokenization. WAVECLIP replaces standard patch embeddings with a multi-level wavelet decomposition, enabling the model to process images coarse to fine while naturally supporting multiple resolutions within the same model. At inference time, the model begins with low resolution tokens and refines only when needed, using key-value caching and causal cross-level attention to reuse computation, effectively introducing to the model only new information when needed. We evaluate WAVECLIP in zero-shot classification, demonstrating that a simple confidence-based gating mechanism enables adaptive early exits. This allows users to dynamically choose a compute-accuracy trade-off using a single deployed model. Our approach requires only lightweight distillation from a frozen CLIP teacher and achieves competitive accuracy with significant computational savings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mammo-CLIP Dissect: A Framework for Analysing Mammography Concepts in Vision-Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21102v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what deep learning (DL) models learn is essential for the safe deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical settings. While previous work has focused on pixel-based explainability methods, less attention has been paid to the textual concepts learned by these models, which may better reflect the reasoning used by clinicians. We introduce Mammo-CLIP Dissect, the first concept-based explainability framework for systematically dissecting DL vision models trained for mammography. Leveraging a mammography-specific vision-language model (Mammo-CLIP) as a "dissector," our approach labels neurons at specified layers with human-interpretable textual concepts and quantifies their alignment to domain knowledge. Using Mammo-CLIP Dissect, we investigate three key questions: (1) how concept learning differs between DL vision models trained on general image datasets versus mammography-specific datasets; (2) how fine-tuning for downstream mammography tasks affects concept specialisation; and (3) which mammography-relevant concepts remain underrepresented. We show that models trained on mammography data capture more clinically relevant concepts and align more closely with radiologists' workflows than models not trained on mammography data. Fine-tuning for task-specific classification enhances the capture of certain concept categories (e.g., benign calcifications) but can reduce coverage of others (e.g., density-related features), indicating a trade-off between specialisation and generalisation. Our findings show that Mammo-CLIP Dissect provides insights into how convolutional neural networks (CNNs) capture mammography-specific knowledge. By comparing models across training data and fine-tuning regimes, we reveal how domain-specific training and task-specific adaptation shape concept learning. Code and concept set are available: https://github.com/Suaiba/Mammo-CLIP-Dissect.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIPin: A Non-contrastive Plug-in to CLIP for Multimodal Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06434v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks. Code is available at https://github.com/T6Yang/CLIPin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpreting ResNet-based CLIP via Neuron-Attention Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19943v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic, represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second, we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability.

| **[Efficiently Disentangling CLIP for Multi-Object Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02977v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP excel at recognizing the single, prominent object in a scene. However, they struggle in complex scenes containing multiple objects. We identify a fundamental reason for this limitation: VLM feature space exhibits excessive mutual feature information (MFI), where the features of one class contain substantial information about other, unrelated classes. This high MFI becomes evident during class-specific queries, as unrelated objects are activated alongside the queried class. To address this limitation, we propose DCLIP, an efficient framework that learns an optimal level of mutual information while adding only minimal learnable parameters to a frozen VLM. DCLIP uses two complementary losses: a novel MFI Loss that regulates class feature similarity to prevent excessive overlap while preserving necessary shared information, and the Asymmetric Loss (ASL) that aligns image features with the disentangled text features. Through this disentanglement, DCLIP reduces excessive inter-class similarity by 30%. On multi-label recognition, DCLIP performs favorably over SOTA approaches on VOC2007 and COCO-14 while using 75% fewer training parameters. For zero-shot semantic segmentation, it shows improved performance across six benchmark datasets. These results highlight the importance of feature disentanglement for multi-object perception in VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-GPPO: Controlling Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}ontrolling \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP Can Understand Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03251v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that CLIP can also be adapted to downstream tasks where its vision-language alignment is suboptimally learned during pre-training on web-crawled data, all without requiring fine-tuning. We explore the case of monocular depth estimation, where CLIP's contrastive prior struggles to generalize, compared to its success in domains such as generative modeling and semantic segmentation. Since CLIP fails to consistently capture similarities between image patches and natural language prompts describing distance, we eliminate the use of its pre-trained natural language token embeddings and distill the semantic prior of its frozen text encoder into a single learnable embedding matrix called "mirror". The main design goal of mirror is to derive a non-human language prompt that approximates an optimal natural language prompt: "How far is this location from the camera?" Using this approach, we jointly train two lightweight modules, a mirror and a compact decoder, on top of a frozen CLIP for dense depth prediction. Compared to conventional depth models, our framework is significantly more efficient in terms of parameters and computation. The resulting model exhibits impressive performance, matching several state-of-the-art vision models on the NYU Depth v2 and KITTI benchmark datasets, while outperforming all vision-language depth models based on a frozen CLIP prior. Experiments demonstrate that the suboptimal depth understanding of CLIP in terms of spatial and temporal consistency can be significantly corrected without either fine-tuning it or concatenating mirror with its pre-trained subword token embeddings. Furthermore, an ablation study on the convergence status of mirror shows that it is implicitly trained to capture objects, such as humans and windows, where semantic cues play an important role in detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Pattern Recognition, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs.\ long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets on Qwen3-8B-Base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-training CLIP against Data Poisoning with Optimal Transport-based Matching and Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18717v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models are threatened by targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks due to massive training image-caption pairs crawled from the Internet. Previous defense methods correct poisoned image-caption pairs by matching a new caption for each image. However, the matching process relies solely on the global representations of images and captions, overlooking fine-grained features of visual and textual features. It may introduce incorrect image-caption pairs and harm the CLIP pre-training. To address their limitations, we propose an Optimal Transport-based framework to reconstruct image-caption pairs, named OTCCLIP. We propose a new optimal transport-based distance measure between fine-grained visual and textual feature sets and re-assign new captions based on the proposed optimal transport distance. Additionally, to further reduce the negative impact of mismatched pairs, we encourage the inter- and intra-modality fine-grained alignment by employing optimal transport-based objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that OTCCLIP can successfully decrease the attack success rates of poisoning attacks. Also, compared to previous methods, OTCCLIP significantly improves CLIP's zero-shot and linear probing performance trained on poisoned datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 Main |
| **[GeoClip: Geometry-Aware Clipping for Differentially Private SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06549v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD) is the most widely used method for training machine learning models with provable privacy guarantees. A key challenge in DP-SGD is setting the per-sample gradient clipping threshold, which significantly affects the trade-off between privacy and utility. While recent adaptive methods improve performance by adjusting this threshold during training, they operate in the standard coordinate system and fail to account for correlations across the coordinates of the gradient. We propose GeoClip, a geometry-aware framework that clips and perturbs gradients in a transformed basis aligned with the geometry of the gradient distribution. GeoClip adaptively estimates this transformation using only previously released noisy gradients, incurring no additional privacy cost. We provide convergence guarantees for GeoClip and derive a closed-form solution for the optimal transformation that minimizes the amount of noise added while keeping the probability of gradient clipping under control. Experiments on both tabular and image datasets demonstrate that GeoClip consistently outperforms existing adaptive clipping methods under the same privacy budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[CardiacCLIP: Video-based CLIP Adaptation for LVEF Prediction in a Few-shot Manner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17065v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Echocardiography is a vital non-invasive modality for cardiac assessment, with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) serving as a key indicator of heart function. Existing LVEF estimation methods depend on large-scale annotated video datasets, which are costly and limit adaptability across various clinical settings. Recent vision-language models for echocardiography, such as EchoCLIP, apply image-to-text pretraining but fail to capture crucial temporal dynamics and localized cardiac structures essential for accurate diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose CardiacCLIP, a video-based framework that enhances LVEF prediction through attention-based frame aggregation and multi-resolution input scaling. Specifically, we introduce MFL (Multi Frame Learning), a novel attention-based mechanism for selectively fusing informative frames, and EchoZoom, a multi-scale feature extraction strategy that refines spatial representations of cardiac structures. As a novel adaptation of CLIP models for few-shot echocardiogram video analysis, our approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing MAE by 2.07 on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset under 1-shot setting. The code is available at https://github.com/xmed-lab/CardiacCLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Neural Antidote: Class-Wise Prompt Tuning for Purifying Backdoors in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19269v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP exhibit impressive representational capabilities for multimodal data, recent studies have revealed their vulnerability to backdoor attacks. To alleviate the threat, existing defense strategies primarily focus on fine-tuning the entire suspicious model. However, the substantial model parameters increase the difficulty of reaching a stable and consistent optimization direction, limiting their resistance against state-of-the-art attacks and often resulting in a degradation of clean accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose Class-wise Backdoor Prompt Tuning (CBPT), an efficient and effective defense mechanism that operates on text prompts to indirectly purify poisoned CLIP. Specifically, we first employ the advanced contrastive learning via carefully crafted positive and negative samples, to effectively invert the backdoor triggers that are potentially adopted by the attacker. Once the dummy trigger is established, we leverage three well-designed loss functions to optimize these class-wise text prompts, modifying the model's decision boundary and further reclassifying the feature regions affected by backdoor triggers. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CBPT significantly mitigates backdoor threats while preserving model utility, e.g. an average Clean Accuracy (CA) of 58.83% and an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 0.39% across seven mainstream backdoor attacks. These results underscore the superiority of our prompt purifying design to strengthen CLIP's robustness against backdoor attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Brain Signal Generation for Visual Prosthesis with CLIP Guided Multimodal Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present, to our knowledge, the first image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging denoising diffusion probabilistic models enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, the proposed framework comprises two key components: a pretrained CLIP visual encoder that extracts rich semantic representations from input images, and a cross-attention enhanced U-Net diffusion model that reconstructs brain signals through iterative denoising. Unlike conventional generative models that rely on simple concatenation for conditioning, our cross-attention modules capture the complex interplay between visual features and brain signal representations, enabling fine-grained alignment during generation. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals. We also present visualizations of M/EEG topographies across all subjects in both datasets, providing intuitive demonstrations of intra-subject and inter-subject variations in brain signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruning the Paradox: How CLIP's Most Informative Heads Enhance Performance While Amplifying Bias](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11103v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP is one of the most popular foundation models and is heavily used for many vision-language tasks, yet little is known about its inner workings. As CLIP is increasingly deployed in real-world applications, it is becoming even more critical to understand its limitations and embedded social biases to mitigate potentially harmful downstream consequences. However, the question of what internal mechanisms drive both the impressive capabilities as well as problematic shortcomings of CLIP has largely remained unanswered. To bridge this gap, we study the conceptual consistency of text descriptions for attention heads in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we propose Concept Consistency Score (CCS), a novel interpretability metric that measures how consistently individual attention heads in CLIP models align with specific concepts. Our soft-pruning experiments reveal that high CCS heads are critical for preserving model performance, as pruning them leads to a significantly larger performance drop than pruning random or low CCS heads. Notably, we find that high CCS heads capture essential concepts and play a key role in out-of-domain detection, concept-specific reasoning, and video-language understanding. Moreover, we prove that high CCS heads learn spurious correlations which amplify social biases. These results position CCS as a powerful interpretability metric exposing the paradox of performance and social biases in CLIP models.</p></details> |  |

To overcome this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models, eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no keyword list is used.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 26th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE), scheduled for 15-17 December 2025 in Marrakech, Morocco</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

| **[When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.</p></details> | BIBM |
| **[DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |

However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community.

Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p></details> |  |

While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |

The model is pretrained on a 206B-token corpus spanning scientific text, pure sequences, and sequence-text pairs, then aligned via SFT on 40M instructions, annealed cold-start bootstrapping to elicit long-form chain-of-thought, and reinforcement learning with task-specific reward shaping, which instills deliberate scientific reasoning. It supports four capability families, covering up to 103 tasks across workflows: (i) faithful translation between text and scientific formats, (ii) text/knowledge extraction, (iii) property prediction, (iv) property classification, (v) unconditional and conditional sequence generation and design. Compared with specialist systems, our approach broadens instruction coverage, improves cross-domain generalization, and enhances fidelity. We detail data curation and training and show that cross-discipline learning strengthens transfer and downstream reliability.

| **[RLBFF: Binary Flexible Feedback to bridge between Human Feedback & Verifiable Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21319v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) are the main RL paradigms used in LLM post-training, each offering distinct advantages. However, RLHF struggles with interpretability and reward hacking because it relies on human judgments that usually lack explicit criteria, whereas RLVR is limited in scope by its focus on correctness-based verifiers. We propose Reinforcement Learning with Binary Flexible Feedback (RLBFF), which combines the versatility of human-driven preferences with the precision of rule-based verification, enabling reward models to capture nuanced aspects of response quality beyond mere correctness. RLBFF extracts principles that can be answered in a binary fashion (e.g. accuracy of information: yes, or code readability: no) from natural language feedback. Such principles can then be used to ground Reward Model training as an entailment task (response satisfies or does not satisfy an arbitrary principle). We show that Reward Models trained in this manner can outperform Bradley-Terry models when matched for data and achieve top performance on RM-Bench (86.2%) and JudgeBench (81.4%, #1 on leaderboard as of September 24, 2025). Additionally, users can specify principles of interest at inference time to customize the focus of our reward models, in contrast to Bradley-Terry models. Finally, we present a fully open source recipe (including data) to align Qwen3-32B using RLBFF and our Reward Model, to match or exceed the performance of o3-mini and DeepSeek R1 on general alignment benchmarks of MT-Bench, WildBench, and Arena Hard v2 (at <5% of the inference cost).</p></details> |  |
| **[VerifyBench: Benchmarking Reference-based Reward Systems for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15801v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models such as OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have achieved remarkable performance in the domain of reasoning. A key component of their training is the incorporation of verifiable rewards within reinforcement learning (RL). However, existing reward benchmarks do not evaluate reference-based reward systems, leaving researchers with limited understanding of the accuracy of verifiers used in RL. In this paper, we introduce two benchmarks, VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, designed to assess the performance of reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Current models still show considerable room for improvement on both VerifyBench and VerifyBench-Hard, especially smaller-scale models. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough and comprehensive analysis of evaluation results, offering insights for understanding and developing reference-based reward systems. Our proposed benchmarks serve as effective tools for guiding the development of verifier accuracy and the reasoning capabilities of models trained via RL in reasoning tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/VerifyBench Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZJU-REAL/VerifyBench Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/VerifyBench</p></details> |
| **[TRACED: Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19997v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generalizing deep reinforcement learning agents to unseen environments remains a significant challenge. One promising solution is Unsupervised Environment Design (UED), a co-evolutionary framework in which a teacher adaptively generates tasks with high learning potential, while a student learns a robust policy from this evolving curriculum. Existing UED methods typically measure learning potential via regret, the gap between optimal and current performance, approximated solely by value-function loss. Building on these approaches, we introduce the transition-prediction error as an additional term in our regret approximation. To capture how training on one task affects performance on others, we further propose a lightweight metric called Co-Learnability. By combining these two measures, we present Transition-aware Regret Approximation with Co-learnability for Environment Design (TRACED). Empirical evaluations show that TRACED produces curricula that improve zero-shot generalization over strong baselines across multiple benchmarks. Ablation studies confirm that the transition-prediction error drives rapid complexity ramp-up and that Co-Learnability delivers additional gains when paired with the transition-prediction error. These results demonstrate how refined regret approximation and explicit modeling of task relationships can be leveraged for sample-efficient curriculum design in UED.

While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information and introduces gradient discontinuities. We propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO), which smooths the current policy's probabilities toward the old (behaviour) policy before computing the importance ratio, analogous to label smoothing. Unlike clipping, PSPO preserves gradient signal, while interpolation toward the old policy creates a soft trust region that discourages large, destabilising updates, with formal guarantees. We instantiate PSPO within GRPO (GR-PSPO) and fine-tune Qwen2.5-0.5B and Qwen2.5-1.5B on GSM8K, evaluating on GSM8K test and the cross-dataset generalisation on SVAMP, ASDiv, and MATH-500. Relative to unclipped GRPO (single iteration; no data reuse, ratio always = 1), GR-PSPO achieves similar performance but improves the reasoning leading to clearer and more concise responses which are more logical. Compared to clipped GRPO, GR-PSPO substantially improves performance both the 0.5B and 1.5B models, with a boost of over 20% on GSM8K (39.7% vs. 17.6% for 0.5B, 59.4% vs. 37.8% for 1.5B).</p></details> |  |
| **[MMR1: Enhancing Multimodal Reasoning with Variance-Aware Sampling and Open Resources](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21268v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large multimodal reasoning models have achieved rapid progress, but their advancement is constrained by two major limitations: the absence of open, large-scale, high-quality long chain-of-thought (CoT) data, and the instability of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms in post-training. Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), the standard framework for RL fine-tuning, is prone to gradient vanishing when reward variance is low, which weakens optimization signals and impairs convergence. This work makes three contributions: (1) We propose Variance-Aware Sampling (VAS), a data selection strategy guided by Variance Promotion Score (VPS) that combines outcome variance and trajectory diversity to promote reward variance and stabilize policy optimization. (2) We release large-scale, carefully curated resources containing ~1.6M long CoT cold-start data and ~15k RL QA pairs, designed to ensure quality, difficulty, and diversity, along with a fully reproducible end-to-end training codebase. (3) We open-source a family of multimodal reasoning models in multiple scales, establishing standardized baselines for the community. Experiments across mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both the curated data and the proposed VAS. Comprehensive ablation studies and analyses provide further insight into the contributions of each component. In addition, we theoretically establish that reward variance lower-bounds the expected policy gradient magnitude, with VAS serving as a practical mechanism to realize this guarantee. Our code, data, and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/LengSicong/MMR1.</p></details> |  |
| **[AMPED: Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05980v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Skill-based reinforcement learning (SBRL) enables rapid adaptation in environments with sparse rewards by pretraining a skill-conditioned policy. Effective skill learning requires jointly maximizing both exploration and skill diversity. However, existing methods often face challenges in simultaneously optimizing for these two conflicting objectives. In this work, we propose a new method, Adaptive Multi-objective Projection for balancing Exploration and skill Diversification (AMPED), which explicitly addresses both: during pre-training, a gradient-surgery projection balances the exploration and diversity gradients, and during fine-tuning, a skill selector exploits the learned diversity by choosing skills suited to downstream tasks. Our approach achieves performance that surpasses SBRL baselines across various benchmarks. Through an extensive ablation study, we identify the role of each component and demonstrate that each element in AMPED is contributing to performance. We further provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, with a greedy skill selector, greater skill diversity reduces fine-tuning sample complexity. These results highlight the importance of explicitly harmonizing exploration and diversity and demonstrate the effectiveness of AMPED in enabling robust and generalizable skill learning.

The framework extends traditional path planning from Euclidean position spaces to the Lie group $\mathrm{SE}(3)$, allowing joint learning of translational motion and rotational dynamics. A modified Bellman-based operator is introduced to support reinforcement learning (RL) policy updates while leveraging prior trajectory information for improved convergence. $\text{GMP}^{3}$ is designed as a distributed framework in which agents influence each other and share policy information along the trajectory: each agent refines its assigned segment and shares with its neighbors via a consensus-based scheme, enabling cooperative policy updates and convergence toward a path shaped globally even under kinematic constraints. We also propose DroneManager, a modular ground control software that interfaces the planner with real UAV platforms via the MAVLink protocol, supporting real-time deployment and feedback. Simulation studies and indoor flight experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in constrained 3D environments, demonstrating reliable obstacle avoidance and smooth, feasible trajectories across both position and orientation.

| **[Tree Search for LLM Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21240v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) have significantly enhanced the agentic capabilities of large language models (LLMs). In long-term and multi-turn agent tasks, existing approaches driven solely by outcome rewards often suffer from the problem of sparse supervision. To address the challenge, we propose Tree-based Group Relative Policy Optimization (Tree-GRPO), a grouped agent RL method based on tree search, where each tree node represents the complete agent interaction step. By sharing common prefixes, the tree search sampling increases the number of rollouts achievable within a fixed budget of tokens or tool calls. Moreover, we find that the tree-structured trajectory naturally allows the construction of step-wise process supervised signals even using only the outcome reward. Based on this, Tree-GRPO estimates the grouped relative advantages both on intra-tree and inter-tree levels. Through theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that the objective of intra-tree level group relative policy optimization is equivalent to that of step-level direct preference learning. Experiments across 11 datasets and 3 types of QA tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed tree-based RL over the chain-based RL method.</p></details> |  |

Previous model-based controllers achieve precise end-effector control but rely on precise dynamics modeling and estimation, which often struggle to capture real-world factors (e.g., friction and backlash) and thus degrade in practice. On the other hand, learning-based methods can better mitigate these factors via exploration and domain randomization, and have shown potential in real-world use. However, they often overfit to training conditions, requiring retraining with the entire body, and still struggle to adapt to unseen scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel stable end-effector control (SEEC) framework with model-enhanced residual learning that learns to achieve precise and robust end-effector compensation for lower-body induced disturbances through model-guided reinforcement learning (RL) with a perturbation generator. This design allows the upper-body policy to achieve accurate end-effector stabilization as well as adapt to unseen locomotion controllers with no additional training. We validate our framework in different simulators and transfer trained policies to the Booster T1 humanoid robot. Experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and robustly handles diverse and demanding loco-manipulation tasks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |

We reveal that existing reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance, effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation. By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1 optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions (R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover, TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited data.

We address this through the problem of \emph{community membership hiding} (CMH), which seeks edge modifications that cause a target node to exit its original community, regardless of the detection algorithm employed. Prior work has focused on non-overlapping community detection, where trivial strategies often suffice, but real-world graphs are better modeled by overlapping communities, where such strategies fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to formalize and address CMH in this setting. In this work, we propose a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that learns effective modification policies, including the use of proxy nodes, while preserving graph structure. Experiments on real-world datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines in both effectiveness and efficiency, offering a principled tool for privacy-preserving graph modification with overlapping communities.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |

Current self-reflection practices rely on heuristic prompts or one-way reasoning: the model is urged to 'think more' instead of learning error diagnosis and repair. This is fragile in multi-turn interactions; after a failure the model often repeats the same mistake. We propose structured reflection, which turns the path from error to repair into an explicit, controllable, and trainable action. The agent produces a short yet precise reflection: it diagnoses the failure using evidence from the previous step and then proposes a correct, executable follow-up call. For training we combine DAPO and GSPO objectives with a reward scheme tailored to tool use, optimizing the stepwise strategy Reflect, then Call, then Final. To evaluate, we introduce Tool-Reflection-Bench, a lightweight benchmark that programmatically checks structural validity, executability, parameter correctness, and result consistency. Tasks are built as mini trajectories of erroneous call, reflection, and corrected call, with disjoint train and test splits. Experiments on BFCL v3 and Tool-Reflection-Bench show large gains in multi-turn tool-call success and error recovery, and a reduction of redundant calls. These results indicate that making reflection explicit and optimizing it directly improves the reliability of tool interaction and offers a reproducible path for agents to learn from failure.</p></details> | 27pages |

However, real-world PHM presents persistent challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation, and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions, simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making. Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain generalization techniques ...</p></details> |  |

An Optimization Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15477v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) critically depends on the quality of the reward model. However, while this quality is primarily evaluated through accuracy, it remains unclear whether accuracy fully captures what makes a reward model an effective teacher. We address this question from an optimization perspective. First, we prove that regardless of how accurate a reward model is, if it induces low reward variance, then the RLHF objective suffers from a flat landscape. Consequently, even a perfectly accurate reward model can lead to extremely slow optimization, underperforming less accurate models that induce higher reward variance. We additionally show that a reward model that works well for one language model can induce low reward variance, and thus a flat objective landscape, for another. These results establish a fundamental limitation of evaluating reward models solely based on accuracy or independently of the language model they guide. Experiments using models of up to 8B parameters corroborate our theory, demonstrating the interplay between reward variance, accuracy, and reward maximization rate. Overall, our findings highlight that beyond accuracy, a reward model needs to induce sufficient variance for efficient~optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025; Code available at https://github.com/princeton-pli/what-makes-good-rm</p></details> |

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two distinct capability regimes: memorization skills and reasoning skills. By training MoE families that vary total parameters, active parameters, and top-$k$ routing under fixed compute budgets, we disentangle pre-training loss from downstream accuracy. Our results reveal two principles. First, Active FLOPs: models with identical training loss but greater active compute achieve higher reasoning accuracy. Second, Total tokens per parameter (TPP): memorization tasks improve with more parameters, while reasoning tasks benefit from optimal TPP, indicating that reasoning is data-hungry. Neither reinforcement learning post-training (GRPO) nor increased test-time compute alters these trends. We therefore argue that optimal MoE sparsity must be determined jointly by active FLOPs and TPP, revising the classical picture of compute-optimal scaling.

| **[Provably Sample-Efficient Robust Reinforcement Learning with Average Reward](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12462v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robust reinforcement learning (RL) under the average-reward criterion is essential for long-term decision-making, particularly when the environment may differ from its specification. However, a significant gap exists in understanding the finite-sample complexity of these methods, as most existing work provides only asymptotic guarantees. This limitation hinders their principled understanding and practical deployment, especially in data-limited scenarios. We close this gap by proposing \textbf{Robust Halpern Iteration (RHI)}, a new algorithm designed for robust Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with transition uncertainty characterized by $\ell_p$-norm and contamination models. Our approach offers three key advantages over previous methods: (1). Weaker Structural Assumptions: RHI only requires the underlying robust MDP to be communicating, a less restrictive condition than the commonly assumed ergodicity or irreducibility; (2). No Prior Knowledge: Our algorithm operates without requiring any prior knowledge of the robust MDP; (3). State-of-the-Art Sample Complexity: To learn an $\epsilon$-optimal robust policy, RHI achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\left(\frac{SA\mathcal H^{2}}{\epsilon^{2}}\right)$, where $S$ and $A$ denote the numbers of states and actions, and $\mathcal H$ is the robust optimal bias span. This result represents the tightest known bound. Our work hence provides essential theoretical understanding of sample efficiency of robust average reward RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, work in progress</p></details> |
| **[Inverse Reinforcement Learning Using Just Classification and a Few Regressions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21172v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) aims to explain observed behavior by uncovering an underlying reward. In the maximum-entropy or Gumbel-shocks-to-reward frameworks, this amounts to fitting a reward function and a soft value function that together satisfy the soft Bellman consistency condition and maximize the likelihood of observed actions. While this perspective has had enormous impact in imitation learning for robotics and understanding dynamic choices in economics, practical learning algorithms often involve delicate inner-loop optimization, repeated dynamic programming, or adversarial training, all of which complicate the use of modern, highly expressive function approximators like neural nets and boosting. We revisit softmax IRL and show that the population maximum-likelihood solution is characterized by a linear fixed-point equation involving the behavior policy. This observation reduces IRL to two off-the-shelf supervised learning problems: probabilistic classification to estimate the behavior policy, and iterative regression to solve the fixed point. The resulting method is simple and modular across function approximation classes and algorithms. We provide a precise characterization of the optimal solution, a generic oracle-based algorithm, finite-sample error bounds, and empirical results showing competitive or superior performance to MaxEnt IRL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Causal Reflection with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04495v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLMs exhibit impressive fluency and factual recall, they struggle with robust causal reasoning, often relying on spurious correlations and brittle patterns. Similarly, traditional Reinforcement Learning agents also lack causal understanding, optimizing for rewards without modeling why actions lead to outcomes. We introduce Causal Reflection, a framework that explicitly models causality as a dynamic function over state, action, time, and perturbation, enabling agents to reason about delayed and nonlinear effects. Additionally, we define a formal Reflect mechanism that identifies mismatches between predicted and observed outcomes and generates causal hypotheses to revise the agent's internal model. In this architecture, LLMs serve not as black-box reasoners, but as structured inference engines translating formal causal outputs into natural language explanations and counterfactuals. Our framework lays the theoretical groundwork for Causal Reflective agents that can adapt, self-correct, and communicate causal understanding in evolving environments.</p></details> |  |

Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose **T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18% improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.</p></details> | 22 pages, 14 figures |
| **[RL Squeezes, SFT Expands: A Comparative Study of Reasoning LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21128v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are typically trained by reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards (RLVR) and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on reasoning traces to improve their reasoning abilities. However, how these methods shape reasoning capabilities remains largely elusive. Going beyond an accuracy-based investigation of how these two components sculpt the reasoning process, this paper introduces a novel analysis framework that quantifies reasoning paths and captures their qualitative changes under each training process (with models of 1.5B, 7B, and 14B parameters on mathematical domains). Specifically, we investigate the reasoning process at two levels of granularity: the trajectory-level, which examines complete reasoning outputs, and the step-level, which analyzes reasoning graphs whose nodes correspond to individual reasoning steps. Notably, clustering of unique reasoning trajectories shows complementary effects: RL compresses incorrect trajectories, whereas SFT expands correct ones. Step-level analysis reveals that RL steepens (about 2.5 times), while SFT flattens (reduced to about one-third), the decay rates of node visitation frequency, degree, and betweenness centrality distributions in the reasoning graph. This indicates that RL concentrates reasoning functionality into a small subset of steps, while SFT homogenizes it across many steps. Furthermore, by evaluating the reasoning graph topologies from multiple perspectives, we delineate the shared and distinct characteristics of RL and SFT. Our work presents a novel reasoning path perspective that explains why the current best practice of two-stage training, with SFT followed by RL, is successful, and offers practical implications for data construction and more efficient learning approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching RL Agents to Act Better: VLM as Action Advisor for Online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21126v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online reinforcement learning in complex tasks is time-consuming, as massive interaction steps are needed to learn the optimal Q-function.Vision-language action (VLA) policies represent a promising direction for solving diverse tasks; however, their performance on low-level control remains limited, and effective deployment often requires task-specific expert demonstrations for fine-tuning. In this paper, we propose \textbf{VARL} (\textbf{V}LM as \textbf{A}ction advisor for online \textbf{R}einforcement \textbf{L}earning), a framework that leverages the domain knowledge of vision-language models (VLMs) to provide action suggestions for reinforcement learning agents. Unlike previous methods, VARL provides action suggestions rather than designing heuristic rewards, thereby guaranteeing unchanged optimality and convergence. The suggested actions increase sample diversity and ultimately improve sample efficiency, especially in sparse-reward tasks. To validate the effectiveness of VARL, we evaluate it across diverse environments and agent settings. Results show that VARL greatly improves sample efficiency without introducing significant computational overhead. These advantages make VARL a general framework for online reinforcement learning and make it feasible to directly apply reinforcement learning from scratch in real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expanding Reasoning Potential in Foundation Model by Learning Diverse Chains of Thought Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21124v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large reasoning models for challenging mathematical reasoning has been driven by reinforcement learning (RL). Incorporating long chain-of-thought (CoT) data during mid-training has also been shown to substantially improve reasoning depth. However, current approaches often utilize CoT data indiscriminately, leaving open the critical question of which data types most effectively enhance model reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we define the foundation model's reasoning potential for the first time as the inverse of the number of independent attempts required to correctly answer the question, which is strongly correlated with the final model performance. We then propose utilizing diverse data enriched with high-value reasoning patterns to expand the reasoning potential. Specifically, we abstract atomic reasoning patterns from CoT sequences, characterized by commonality and inductive capabilities, and use them to construct a core reference set enriched with valuable reasoning patterns. Furthermore, we propose a dual-granularity algorithm involving chains of reasoning patterns and token entropy, efficiently selecting high-value CoT data (CoTP) from the data pool that aligns with the core set, thereby training models to master reasoning effectively. Only 10B-token CoTP data enables the 85A6B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model to improve by 9.58% on the challenging AIME 2024 and 2025, and to raise the upper bound of downstream RL performance by 7.81%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple "Motivation" Can Enhance Reinforcement Finetuning of Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18485v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful learn-to-reason paradigm for Large Reasoning Models to tackle complex tasks. However, current RLVR paradigm is still not efficient enough, as it works in a trial-and-error manner. To perform better, the model needs to explore the reward space by numerously generating responses and learn from fragmented reward signals, blind to the overall reward patterns. Fortunately, verifiable rewards make the natural language description of the reward function possible, and meanwhile, LLMs have demonstrated strong in-context learning ability. This motivates us to explore if Large Reasoning Models can benefit from a motivation of the task, i.e., awareness of the reward function, during the reinforcement finetuning process, as we humans sometimes do when learning. In this paper, we introduce Motivation-enhanced Reinforcement Finetuning (MeRF), an intuitive yet effective method enhancing reinforcement finetuning of LLMs by involving ``telling LLMs rules of the game''. Specifically, MeRF directly injects the reward specification into the prompt, which serves as an in-context motivation for the model to be aware of the optimization objective. This simple modification leverages the in-context learning ability of LLMs, aligning generation with optimization, thereby incentivizing the model to generate desired outputs from both inner motivation and external reward. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MeRF achieves substantial performance gains over RLVR baseline. Moreover, ablation studies show that MeRF performs better with greater consistency between the in-context motivation and the external reward function, while the model also demonstrates an ability to adapt to misleading motivations through reinforcement finetuning.</p></details> |  |

We propose a hierarchical control framework that decouples high-level balancing policy from low-level drone control, and train a reinforcement learning (RL) policy to handle the high-level decision-making. Simulation results show that the RL policy achieves superior performance compared to carefully tuned PID controllers within the same hierarchical structure. Through systematic comparative analysis, we demonstrate that RL's advantage stems not from improved parameter tuning or inherent nonlinear mapping capabilities, but from its ability to effectively utilize richer state observations. These findings underscore the critical role of comprehensive state representation in learning-based systems and suggest that enhanced sensing could be instrumental in improving controller performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the Advancements in Aerial Physical Interaction Workshop of the IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Mirror Descent Policy Optimisation for Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23165v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained MDP. Our proposed algorithm obtains an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(1/T^{1/3}\right)$ convergence rate in the sample-based RCMDP setting. In addition to the RCMDP setting, the paper also contributes an algorithm for approximate gradient descent in the space of transition kernels, which is of independent interest for designing adversarial environments. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSS-ChatV: Reinforcement Learning with Process Reasoning Reward for Video Temporal Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21113v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video reasoning has emerged as a critical capability for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), requiring models to move beyond static perception toward coherent understanding of temporal dynamics in complex scenes. Yet existing MLLMs often exhibit process inconsistency, where intermediate reasoning drifts from video dynamics even when the final answer is correct, undermining interpretability and robustness. To address this issue, we introduce MOSS-ChatV, a reinforcement learning framework with a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based process reward. This rule-based reward aligns reasoning traces with temporally grounded references, enabling efficient process supervision without auxiliary reward models. We further identify dynamic state prediction as a key measure of video reasoning and construct MOSS-Video, a benchmark with annotated reasoning traces, where the training split is used to fine-tune MOSS-ChatV and the held-out split is reserved for evaluation. MOSS-ChatV achieves 87.2\% on MOSS-Video (test) and improves performance on general video benchmarks such as MVBench and MMVU. The framework consistently yields gains across different architectures, including Qwen2.5-VL and Phi-2, confirming its broad applicability. Evaluations with GPT-4o-as-judge further show that MOSS-ChatV produces more consistent and stable reasoning traces.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13148v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens, whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random. Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and 54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine tokens flexibly. This training-free method, termed Running Confidence Remasking (RCR), consistently enhances performance and provides further improvements when used with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs. Code: https://github.com/autonomousvision/mdpo.

| **[Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21107v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot. While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm, Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Deploying edge cameras across urban environments is a standard practice for monitoring road conditions. However, integrating these with intelligent models requires a robust understanding of dynamic traffic scenarios and a responsive interface for user interaction. Although multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) can interpret traffic images and generate informative responses, their deployment on edge devices is infeasible due to high computational demands. Therefore, LLM inference must occur on the cloud, necessitating visual data transmission from edge to cloud, a process hindered by limited bandwidth, leading to potential delays that compromise real-time performance. To address this challenge, we propose a semantic communication framework that significantly reduces transmission overhead. Our method involves detecting Regions of Interest (RoIs) using YOLOv11, cropping relevant image segments, and converting them into compact embedding vectors using a Vision Transformer (ViT). These embeddings are then transmitted to the cloud, where an image decoder reconstructs the cropped images. The reconstructed images are processed by a multimodal LLM to generate traffic condition descriptions. This approach achieves a 99.9% reduction in data transmission size while maintaining an LLM response accuracy of 89% for reconstructed cropped images, compared to 93% accuracy with original cropped images. Our results demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of ViT and LLM-assisted edge-cloud semantic communication for real-time traffic surveillance.</p></details> | 17 pages, 12 figures |

While stratified sampling has proven effective for addressing label distribution imbalance in classification tasks, extending these ideas to segmentation remains challenging due to the multi-label structure and class imbalance typically present in such data. Building on existing stratification concepts, we introduce Iterative Pixel Stratification (IPS), a straightforward, label-aware sampling method tailored for segmentation tasks. Additionally, we present Wasserstein-Driven Evolutionary Stratification (WDES), a novel genetic algorithm designed to minimize the Wasserstein distance, thereby optimizing the similarity of label distributions across dataset splits. We prove that WDES is globally optimal given enough generations. Using newly proposed statistical heterogeneity metrics, we evaluate both methods against random sampling and find that WDES consistently produces more representative splits. Applying WDES across diverse segmentation tasks, including street scenes, medical imaging, and satellite imagery, leads to lower performance variance and improved model evaluation. Our results also highlight the particular value of WDES in handling small, imbalanced, and low-diversity datasets, where conventional splitting strategies are most prone to bias.</p></details> | Preprint, 9 pages |

While this information can be particularly valuable in high-stakes domains such as medical imaging, these scores are heuristic in nature and do not constitute rigorous quantitative uncertainty estimates. Conformal prediction (CP) provides a principled framework for transforming heuristic confidence scores into statistically valid uncertainty estimates. However, applying CP directly to image segmentation ignores the spatial correlations between pixels, a fundamental characteristic of image data. This can result in overly conservative and less interpretable uncertainty estimates. To address this, we propose CONSIGN (Conformal Segmentation Informed by Spatial Groupings via Decomposition), a CP-based method that incorporates spatial correlations to improve uncertainty quantification in image segmentation. Our method generates meaningful prediction sets that come with user-specified, high-probability error guarantees. It is compatible with any pre-trained segmentation model capable of generating multiple sample outputs. We evaluate CONSIGN against two CP baselines across three medical imaging datasets and two COCO dataset subsets, using three different pre-trained segmentation models. Results demonstrate that accounting for spatial structure significantly improves performance across multiple metrics and enhances the quality of uncertainty estimates.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, they remain underexploited since the superpixel decomposition may produce irregular and non stable segmentation results due to the dependency to the image content. In this paper, we first introduce a novel structure, a superpixel-based patch, called SuperPatch. The proposed structure, based on superpixel neighborhood, leads to a robust descriptor since spatial information is naturally included. The generalization of the PatchMatch method to SuperPatches, named SuperPatchMatch, is introduced. Finally, we propose a framework to perform fast segmentation and labeling from an image database, and demonstrate the potential of our approach since we outperform, in terms of computational cost and accuracy, the results of state-of-the-art methods on both face labeling and medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Image Processing (TIP), 2017 Selected for presentation at IEEE International Conference on Image Processing (ICIP) 2017</p></details> |

However, this task is often challenged by the high spatial resolution, complex scene structures, and diverse object scales present in remote sensing data. To address these challenges, various deep learning architectures have been proposed, including convolutional neural networks, Vision Transformers, and the recently introduced Vision Mamba. Vision Mamba features a global receptive field and low computational complexity, demonstrating both efficiency and effectiveness in image segmentation. However, its reliance on global scanning tends to overlook critical local features, such as textures and edges, which are essential for achieving accurate segmentation in remote sensing contexts. To tackle this limitation, we propose SwinMamba, a novel framework inspired by the Swin Transformer. SwinMamba integrates localized Mamba-style scanning within shifted windows with a global receptive field, to enhance the model's perception of both local and global features. Specifically, the first two stages of SwinMamba perform local scanning to capture fine-grained details, while its subsequent two stages leverage global scanning to fuse broader contextual information. In our model, the use of overlapping shifted windows enhances inter-region information exchange, facilitating more robust feature integration across the entire image. Extensive experiments on the LoveDA and ISPRS Potsdam datasets demonstrate that SwinMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods, underscoring its effectiveness and potential as a superior solution for semantic segmentation of remotely sensed imagery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding 3D Positions of Distant Objects from Noisy Camera Movement and Semantic Segmentation Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20906v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dual-supervised Asymmetric Co-training for Semi-supervised Medical Domain Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20785v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised domain generalization (SSDG) in medical image segmentation offers a promising solution for generalizing to unseen domains during testing, addressing domain shift challenges and minimizing annotation costs. However, conventional SSDG methods assume labeled and unlabeled data are available for each source domain in the training set, a condition that is not always met in practice. The coexistence of limited annotation and domain shift in the training set is a prevalent issue. Thus, this paper explores a more practical and challenging scenario, cross-domain semi-supervised domain generalization (CD-SSDG), where domain shifts occur between labeled and unlabeled training data, in addition to shifts between training and testing sets. Existing SSDG methods exhibit sub-optimal performance under such domain shifts because of inaccurate pseudolabels. To address this issue, we propose a novel dual-supervised asymmetric co-training (DAC) framework tailored for CD-SSDG. Building upon the co-training paradigm with two sub-models offering cross pseudo supervision, our DAC framework integrates extra feature-level supervision and asymmetric auxiliary tasks for each sub-model. This feature-level supervision serves to address inaccurate pseudo supervision caused by domain shifts between labeled and unlabeled data, utilizing complementary supervision from the rich feature space. Additionally, two distinct auxiliary self-supervised tasks are integrated into each sub-model to enhance domain-invariant discriminative feature learning and prevent model collapse. Extensive experiments on real-world medical image segmentation datasets, i.e., Fundus, Polyp, and SCGM, demonstrate the robust generalizability of the proposed DAC framework.</p></details> | 13 pages, 14 figures |

Despite its progress in remote sensing applications, RIS in Low-Altitude Drone (LAD) scenarios remains underexplored. Existing datasets and methods are typically designed for high-altitude and static-view imagery. They struggle to handle the unique characteristics of LAD views, such as diverse viewpoints and high object density. To fill this gap, we present RIS-LAD, the first fine-grained RIS benchmark tailored for LAD scenarios. This dataset comprises 13,871 carefully annotated image-text-mask triplets collected from realistic drone footage, with a focus on small, cluttered, and multi-viewpoint scenes. It highlights new challenges absent in previous benchmarks, such as category drift caused by tiny objects and object drift under crowded same-class objects. To tackle these issues, we propose the Semantic-Aware Adaptive Reasoning Network (SAARN). Rather than uniformly injecting all linguistic features, SAARN decomposes and routes semantic information to different stages of the network. Specifically, the Category-Dominated Linguistic Enhancement (CDLE) aligns visual features with object categories during early encoding, while the Adaptive Reasoning Fusion Module (ARFM) dynamically selects semantic cues across scales to improve reasoning in complex scenes. The experimental evaluation reveals that RIS-LAD presents substantial challenges to state-of-the-art RIS algorithms, and also demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed model in addressing these challenges. The dataset and code will be publicly released soon at: https://github.com/AHideoKuzeA/RIS-LAD/.</p></details> |  |

Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |
| **[Boosting LiDAR-Based Localization with Semantic Insight: Camera Projection versus Direct LiDAR Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20486v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation of LiDAR data presents considerable challenges, particularly when dealing with diverse sensor types and configurations. However, incorporating semantic information can significantly enhance the accuracy and robustness of LiDAR-based localization techniques for autonomous mobile systems. We propose an approach that integrates semantic camera data with LiDAR segmentation to address this challenge. By projecting LiDAR points into the semantic segmentation space of the camera, our method enhances the precision and reliability of the LiDAR-based localization pipeline. For validation, we utilize the CoCar NextGen platform from the FZI Research Center for Information Technology, which offers diverse sensor modalities and configurations. The sensor setup of CoCar NextGen enables a thorough analysis of different sensor types. Our evaluation leverages the state-of-the-art Depth-Anything network for camera image segmentation and an adaptive segmentation network for LiDAR segmentation. To establish a reliable ground truth for LiDAR-based localization, we make us of a Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) solution with Real-Time Kinematic corrections (RTK). Additionally, we conduct an extensive 55 km drive through the city of Karlsruhe, Germany, covering a variety of environments, including urban areas, multi-lane roads, and rural highways. This multimodal approach paves the way for more reliable and precise autonomous navigation systems, particularly in complex real-world environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiPerformer: A High-Performance Global-Local Segmentation Model with Modular Hierarchical Fusion Strategy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20280v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both local details and global context are crucial in medical image segmentation, and effectively integrating them is essential for achieving high accuracy. However, existing mainstream methods based on CNN-Transformer hybrid architectures typically employ simple feature fusion techniques such as serial stacking, endpoint concatenation, or pointwise addition, which struggle to address the inconsistencies between features and are prone to information conflict and loss. To address the aforementioned challenges, we innovatively propose HiPerformer. The encoder of HiPerformer employs a novel modular hierarchical architecture that dynamically fuses multi-source features in parallel, enabling layer-wise deep integration of heterogeneous information. The modular hierarchical design not only retains the independent modeling capability of each branch in the encoder, but also ensures sufficient information transfer between layers, effectively avoiding the degradation of features and information loss that come with traditional stacking methods. Furthermore, we design a Local-Global Feature Fusion (LGFF) module to achieve precise and efficient integration of local details and global semantic information, effectively alleviating the feature inconsistency problem and resulting in a more comprehensive feature representation. To further enhance multi-scale feature representation capabilities and suppress noise interference, we also propose a Progressive Pyramid Aggregation (PPA) module to replace traditional skip connections. Experiments on eleven public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing segmentation techniques, demonstrating higher segmentation accuracy and robustness. The code is available at https://github.com/xzphappy/HiPerformer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Shortest Path-based Superpixels for 3D Spherical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19895v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing use of wide angle image capture devices and the need for fast and accurate image analysis in computer visions have enforced the need for dedicated under-representation approaches. Most recent decomposition methods segment an image into a small number of irregular homogeneous regions, called superpixels. Nevertheless, these approaches are generally designed to segment standard 2D planar images, i.e., captured with a 90o angle view without distortion. In this work, we introduce a new general superpixel method called SphSPS (for Spherical Shortest Path-based Superpixels)1 , dedicated to wide 360o spherical or omnidirectional images. Our method respects the geometry of the 3D spherical acquisition space and generalizes the notion of shortest path between a pixel and a superpixel center, to fastly extract relevant clustering features. We demonstrate that considering the geometry of the acquisition space to compute the shortest path enables to jointly improve the segmentation accuracy and the shape regularity of superpixels. To evaluate this regularity aspect, we also generalize a global regularity metric to the spherical space, addressing the limitations of the only existing spherical compactness measure. Finally, the proposed SphSPS method is validated on the reference 360o spherical panorama segmentation dataset and on synthetic road omnidirectional images. Our method significantly outperforms both planar and spherical state-of-the-art approaches in terms of segmentation accuracy,robustness to noise and regularity, providing a very interesting tool for superpixel-based applications on 360o images.</p></details> |  |

When combined with active learning (AL), these strategies further minimize annotation burden by selectively incorporating the most informative samples. However, conventional SSL_AL hybrid approaches often rely on iterative and loop-based retraining cycles after each annotation round, incurring significant computational overhead and limiting scalability in clinical applications. In this study, we present a novel, annotation-efficient, and self-adaptive deep segmentation framework that integrates SSL with entropy-based pseudo-label filtering (FilterMatch), an AL-inspired mechanism, within the single-pass nnU-Net training segmentation framework (nnFilterMatch). By selectively excluding high-confidence pseudo-labels during training, our method circumvents the need for retraining loops while preserving the benefits of uncertainty-guided learning. We validate the proposed framework across multiple clinical segmentation benchmarks and demonstrate that it achieves performance comparable to or exceeding fully supervised models, even with only 5\%--20\% labeled data. This work introduces a scalable, end-to-end learning strategy for reducing annotation demands in medical image segmentation without compromising accuracy.

Recent studies have demonstrated that the accuracy of the medical image segmentation can be improved by incorporating clinical text reports as semantic guidance. However, the complex morphological changes of lesions and the inherent semantic gap between vision-language modalities prevent existing methods from effectively enhancing the representation of visual features and eliminating semantically irrelevant information, ultimately resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. To address these problems, we propose a Frequency-domain Multi-modal Interaction model (FMISeg) for language-guided medical image segmentation. FMISeg is a late fusion model that establishes interaction between linguistic features and frequency-domain visual features in the decoder. Specifically, to enhance the visual representation, our method introduces a Frequency-domain Feature Bidirectional Interaction (FFBI) module to effectively fuse frequency-domain features. Furthermore, a Language-guided Frequency-domain Feature Interaction (LFFI) module is incorporated within the decoder to suppress semantically irrelevant visual features under the guidance of linguistic information. Experiments on QaTa-COV19 and MosMedData+ demonstrated that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods qualitatively and quantitatively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MICCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Robust In-Context Learning for Medical Image Segmentation via Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19711v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of In-Context Learning (ICL) for universal medical image segmentation has introduced an unprecedented demand for large-scale, diverse datasets for training, exacerbating the long-standing problem of data scarcity. While data synthesis offers a promising solution, existing methods often fail to simultaneously achieve both high data diversity and a domain distribution suitable for medical data. To bridge this gap, we propose \textbf{SynthICL}, a novel data synthesis framework built upon domain randomization. SynthICL ensures realism by leveraging anatomical priors from real-world datasets, generates diverse anatomical structures to cover a broad data distribution, and explicitly models inter-subject variations to create data cohorts suitable for ICL. Extensive experiments on four held-out datasets validate our framework's effectiveness, showing that models trained with our data achieve performance gains of up to 63\% in average Dice and substantially enhanced generalization to unseen anatomical domains. Our work helps mitigate the data bottleneck for ICL-based segmentation, paving the way for robust models. Our code and the generated dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Neuroverse3D.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we present a framework that leverages synthetic RGB imagery, a limited set of real annotations, and GAN-based cross-modality alignment to enhance semantic segmentation in thermal images. We trained models on 1,128 synthetic images containing complex mixtures of crop and weed plants in order to generate image segmentation masks for crop and weed plants. We additionally evaluated the benefit of integrating as few as five real, manually segmented field images within the training process using various sampling strategies. When combining all the synthetic images with a few labeled real images, we observed a maximum relative improvement of 22% for the weed class and 17% for the plant class compared to the full real-data baseline. Cross-modal alignment was enabled by translating RGB to thermal using CycleGAN-turbo, allowing robust template matching without calibration. Results demonstrated that combining synthetic data with limited manual annotations and cross-domain translation via generative models can significantly boost segmentation performance in complex field environments for multi-model imagery.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use class activation maps (CAMs) from ViTs to generate prompts for SAM, resulting in masks suitable for food image segmentation. The ViT model, a Swin Transformer, is trained exclusively using image-level annotations, eliminating the need for pixel-level annotations during training. Additionally, to enhance the quality of the SAM-generated masks, we examine the use of image preprocessing techniques in combination with single-mask and multi-mask SAM generation strategies. The methodology is evaluated on the FoodSeg103 dataset, generating an average of 2.4 masks per image (excluding background), and achieving an mIoU of 0.54 for the multi-mask scenario. We envision the proposed approach as a tool to accelerate food image annotation tasks or as an integrated component in food and nutrition tracking applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the 20th International Workshop on Semantic and Social Media Adaptation & Personalization</p></details> |

Central to MK-UNet is the multi-kernel depth-wise convolution block (MKDC) we design to adeptly process images through multiple kernels, while capturing complex multi-resolution spatial relationships. MK-UNet also emphasizes the images salient features through sophisticated attention mechanisms, including channel, spatial, and grouped gated attention. Our MK-UNet network, with a modest computational footprint of only 0.316M parameters and 0.314G FLOPs, represents not only a remarkably lightweight, but also significantly improved segmentation solution that provides higher accuracy over state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across six binary medical imaging benchmarks. Specifically, MK-UNet outperforms TransUNet in DICE score with nearly 333$\times$ and 123$\times$ fewer parameters and FLOPs, respectively. Similarly, when compared against UNeXt, MK-UNet exhibits superior segmentation performance, improving the DICE score up to 6.7% margins while operating with 4.7$\times$ fewer #Params. Our MK-UNet also outperforms other recent lightweight networks, such as MedT, CMUNeXt, EGE-UNet, and Rolling-UNet, with much lower computational resources. This leap in performance, coupled with drastic computational gains, positions MK-UNet as an unparalleled solution for real-time, high-fidelity medical diagnostics in resource-limited settings, such as point-of-care devices.

| **[Look, Focus, Act: Efficient and Robust Robot Learning via Human Gaze and Foveated Vision Transformers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15833v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human vision is a highly active process driven by gaze, which directs attention to task-relevant regions through foveation, dramatically reducing visual processing. In contrast, robot learning systems typically rely on passive, uniform processing of raw camera images. In this work, we explore how incorporating human-like active gaze into robotic policies can enhance efficiency and robustness. We develop GIAVA (Gaze Integrated Active-Vision ALOHA), a robot vision system that emulates human head and neck movement, and gaze adjustment for foveated processing. Extending the AV-ALOHA robot platform, we introduce a framework for simultaneously collecting eye-tracking, perspective control, and robot manipulation demonstration data from a human operator. We also open-source a simulation benchmark and dataset for training robot policies that incorporate human gaze. Inspired by recent work in foveated image segmentation and given the widespread use of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in robot learning, we integrate gaze information into ViTs using a foveated patch tokenization scheme. Compared to uniform patch tokenization, this significantly reduces the number of tokens, and thus computation. Our results show that our method for foveated robot vision drastically reduces computational overhead, and enhances robustness to background distractors. Notably, on certain high-precision tasks, foveated vision also improves performance, as reflected in higher success rates. Together, these findings suggest that human-inspired foveated visual processing offers untapped potential and should be further considered as a useful inductive bias in robotic vision systems. https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ian-chuang.github.io/gaze-av-aloha/</p></details> |
| **[Conformal In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy: Efficient Estimation of Segmentation Quality with Statistical Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04522v3)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the quality of automatic image segmentation is crucial in clinical practice, but often very challenging due to the limited availability of ground truth annotations. Reverse Classification Accuracy (RCA) is an approach that estimates the quality of new predictions on unseen samples by training a segmenter on those predictions, and then evaluating it against existing annotated images. In this work, we introduce Conformal In-Context RCA, a novel method for automatically estimating segmentation quality with statistical guarantees in the absence of ground-truth annotations, which consists of two main innovations. First, In-Context RCA, which leverages recent in-context learning models for image segmentation and incorporates retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images. This approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data while avoiding the need of training additional models. Second, we introduce Conformal RCA, which extends both the original RCA framework and In-Context RCA to go beyond point estimation. Using tools from split conformal prediction, Conformal RCA produces prediction intervals for segmentation quality providing statistical guarantees that the true score lies within the estimated interval with a user-specified probability. Validated across 10 different medical imaging tasks in various organs and modalities, our methods demonstrate robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential.

| **[A Semantic Segmentation Algorithm for Pleural Effusion Based on DBIF-AUNet](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06191v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pleural effusion semantic segmentation can significantly enhance the accuracy and timeliness of clinical diagnosis and treatment by precisely identifying disease severity and lesion areas. Currently, semantic segmentation of pleural effusion CT images faces multiple challenges. These include similar gray levels between effusion and surrounding tissues, blurred edges, and variable morphology. Existing methods often struggle with diverse image variations and complex edges, primarily because direct feature concatenation causes semantic gaps. To address these challenges, we propose the Dual-Branch Interactive Fusion Attention model (DBIF-AUNet). This model constructs a densely nested skip-connection network and innovatively refines the Dual-Domain Feature Disentanglement module (DDFD). The DDFD module orthogonally decouples the functions of dual-domain modules to achieve multi-scale feature complementarity and enhance characteristics at different levels. Concurrently, we design a Branch Interaction Attention Fusion module (BIAF) that works synergistically with the DDFD. This module dynamically weights and fuses global, local, and frequency band features, thereby improving segmentation robustness. Furthermore, we implement a nested deep supervision mechanism with hierarchical adaptive hybrid loss to effectively address class imbalance. Through validation on 1,622 pleural effusion CT images from Southwest Hospital, DBIF-AUNet achieved IoU and Dice scores of 80.1% and 89.0% respectively. These results outperform state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models U-Net++ and Swin-UNet by 5.7%/2.7% and 2.2%/1.5% respectively, demonstrating significant optimization in segmentation accuracy for complex pleural effusion CT images.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, existing deep networks integrating connectivity often forcibly inject it as an additional feature module, resulting in coupled feature spaces with no standardized mechanism to quantify different feature strengths. To address these issues, we propose DCFFSNet (Dual-Connectivity Feature Fusion-Separation Network). It introduces an innovative feature space decoupling strategy. This strategy quantifies the relative strength between connectivity features and other features. It then builds a deep connectivity feature fusion-separation architecture. This architecture dynamically balances multi-scale feature expression. Experiments were conducted on the ISIC2018, DSB2018, and MoNuSeg datasets. On ISIC2018, DCFFSNet outperformed the next best model (CMUNet) by 1.3% (Dice) and 1.2% (IoU). On DSB2018, it surpassed TransUNet by 0.7% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). On MoNuSeg, it exceeded CSCAUNet by 0.8% (Dice) and 0.9% (IoU). The results demonstrate that DCFFSNet exceeds existing mainstream methods across all metrics. It effectively resolves segmentation fragmentation and achieves smooth edge transitions. This significantly enhances clinical usability.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages , 11 figures</p></details> |

We developed a multimodal educational approach for students and trainees during the MICCAI Brain Tumor Segmentation Lighthouse Challenge 2025, a landmark initiative to develop accurate brain tumor segmentation algorithms. Fifty-six medical students & radiology trainees volunteered to annotate brain tumor MR images for the BraTS challenges of 2023 & 2024, guided by faculty-led didactics on neuropathology MRI. Among the 56 annotators, 14 select volunteers were then paired with neuroradiology faculty for guided one-on-one annotation sessions for BraTS 2025. Lectures on neuroanatomy, pathology & AI, journal clubs & data scientist-led workshops were organized online. Annotators & audience members completed surveys on their perceived knowledge before & after annotations & lectures respectively. Fourteen coordinators, each paired with a neuroradiologist, completed the data annotation process, averaging 1322.9+/-760.7 hours per dataset per pair and 1200 segmentations in total. On a scale of 1-10, annotation coordinators reported significant increase in familiarity with image segmentation software pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6+/-2.9 to final average of 8.9+/-1.1, and significant increase in familiarity with brain tumor features pre- and post-annotation, moving from initial average of 6.2+/-2.4 to final average of 8.1+/-1.2.

Recent foundation models like MedSAM achieve strong results using point or bounding-box prompts but still require manual interaction. We propose DescriptorMedSAM, a lightweight extension of MedSAM that incorporates structured text prompts, ranging from simple organ names to combined shape and location descriptors to enable click-free segmentation. DescriptorMedSAM employs a CLIP text encoder to convert radiology-style descriptors into dense embeddings, which are fused with visual tokens via a cross-attention block and a multi-scale feature extractor. We designed four descriptor types: Name (N), Name + Shape (NS), Name + Location (NL), and Name + Shape + Location (NSL), and evaluated them on the FLARE 2022 dataset under zero-shot and few-shot settings, where organs unseen during training must be segmented with minimal additional data. NSL prompts achieved the highest performance, with a Dice score of 0.9405 under full supervision, a 76.31% zero-shot retention ratio, and a 97.02% retention ratio after fine-tuning with only 50 labeled slices per unseen organ. Adding shape and location cues consistently improved segmentation accuracy, especially for small or morphologically complex structures. We demonstrate that structured language prompts can effectively replace spatial interactions, delivering strong zero-shot performance and rapid few-shot adaptation. By quantifying the role of descriptor, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, prompt-aware segmentation models that generalize across diverse anatomical targets with minimal annotation effort.</p></details> |  |

However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

| **[BiPrompt-SAM: Enhancing Image Segmentation via Explicit Selection between Point and Text Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19769v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with prompt-driven methods gaining prominence due to their flexibility. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) excels at point-prompted segmentation, while text-based models, often leveraging powerful multimodal encoders like BEIT-3, provide rich semantic understanding. However, effectively combining these complementary modalities remains a challenge. This paper introduces BiPrompt-SAM, a novel dual-modal prompt segmentation framework employing an explicit selection mechanism. We leverage SAM's ability to generate multiple mask candidates from a single point prompt and use a text-guided mask (generated via EVF-SAM with BEIT-3) to select the point-generated mask that best aligns spatially, measured by Intersection over Union (IoU). This approach, interpretable as a simplified Mixture of Experts (MoE), effectively fuses spatial precision and semantic context without complex model modifications. Notably, our method achieves strong zero-shot performance on the Endovis17 medical dataset (89.55% mDice, 81.46% mIoU) using only a single point prompt per instance. This significantly reduces annotation burden compared to bounding boxes and aligns better with practical clinical workflows, demonstrating the method's effectiveness without domain-specific training. On the RefCOCO series, BiPrompt-SAM attained 87.1%, 86.5%, and 85.8% IoU, significantly outperforming existing approaches. Experiments show BiPrompt-SAM excels in scenarios requiring both spatial accuracy and semantic disambiguation, offering a simple, effective, and interpretable perspective on multi-modal prompt fusion.</p></details> | metrics went wrong |

| **[SOOD++: Leveraging Unlabeled Data to Boost Oriented Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01016v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised object detection (SSOD), leveraging unlabeled data to boost object detectors, has become a hot topic recently. However, existing SSOD approaches mainly focus on horizontal objects, leaving oriented objects common in aerial images unexplored. At the same time, the annotation cost of oriented objects is significantly higher than that of their horizontal counterparts. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a simple yet effective Semi-supervised Oriented Object Detection method termed SOOD++. Specifically, we observe that objects from aerial images usually have arbitrary orientations, small scales, and dense distribution, which inspires the following core designs: a Simple Instance-aware Dense Sampling (SIDS) strategy is used to generate comprehensive dense pseudo-labels; the Geometry-aware Adaptive Weighting (GAW) loss dynamically modulates the importance of each pair between pseudo-label and corresponding prediction by leveraging the intricate geometric information of aerial objects; we treat aerial images as global layouts and explicitly build the many-to-many relationship between the sets of pseudo-labels and predictions via the proposed Noise-driven Global Consistency (NGC). Extensive experiments conducted on various oriented object datasets under various labeled settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For example, on the DOTA-V2.0/DOTA-V1.5 benchmark, the proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) by a large margin (+2.90/2.14, +2.16/2.18, and +2.66/2.32) mAP under 10%, 20%, and 30% labeled data settings, respectively, with single-scale training and testing. More importantly, it still improves upon a strong supervised baseline with 70.66 mAP, trained using the full DOTA-V1.5 train-val set, by +1.82 mAP, resulting in a 72.48 mAP, pushing the new state-of-the-art.

However, transmitting high-volume raw task data (e.g., 4K video) over bandwidth-limited wireless networks incurs significant latency. While EDs can reduce transmission latency by degrading data before transmission (e.g., reducing resolution from 4K to 720p or 480p), it often deteriorates inference accuracy, creating a critical accuracy-latency tradeoff. The difficulty in balancing this tradeoff stems from the absence of closed-form models capturing content-dependent accuracy-latency relationships. Besides, under bandwidth sharing constraints, the discrete degradation decisions among the EDs demonstrate inherent combinatorial complexity. Mathematically, it requires solving a challenging \textit{black-box} mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP). To address this problem, we propose LAB, a novel learning framework that seamlessly integrates deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and Bayesian optimization (BO). Specifically, LAB employs: (a) a DNN-based actor that maps input system state to degradation actions, directly addressing the combinatorial complexity of the MINLP; and (b) a BO-based critic with an explicit model built from fitting a Gaussian process surrogate with historical observations, enabling model-based evaluation of degradation actions. For each selected action, optimal bandwidth allocation is then efficiently derived via convex optimization. Numerical evaluations on real-world self-driving datasets demonstrate that LAB achieves near-optimal accuracy-latency tradeoff, exhibiting only 1.22\% accuracy degradation and 0.07s added latency compared to exhaustive search...</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Modular Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10787v4)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) extends recognition beyond fixed taxonomies by aligning visual and textual features, as in MDETR, GLIP, or RegionCLIP. While effective, these models require updating all parameters of large vision--language backbones, leading to prohibitive training cost. Recent efficient OVD approaches, inspired by parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA or adapters, reduce trainable parameters but often face challenges in selecting which layers to adapt and in balancing efficiency with accuracy. We propose UniProj-Det, a lightweight modular framework for parameter-efficient OVD. UniProj-Det freezes pretrained backbones and introduces a Universal Projection module with a learnable modality token, enabling unified vision--language adaptation at minimal cost. Applied to MDETR, our framework trains only about ~2-5% of parameters while achieving competitive or superior performance on phrase grounding, referring expression comprehension, and segmentation. Comprehensive analysis of FLOPs, memory, latency, and ablations demonstrates UniProj-Det as a principled step toward scalable and efficient open-vocabulary detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Finding 3D Positions of Distant Objects from Noisy Camera Movement and Semantic Segmentation Sequences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20906v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D object localisation based on a sequence of camera measurements is essential for safety-critical surveillance tasks, such as drone-based wildfire monitoring. Localisation of objects detected with a camera can typically be solved with dense depth estimation or 3D scene reconstruction. However, in the context of distant objects or tasks limited by the amount of available computational resources, neither solution is feasible. In this paper, we show that the task can be solved using particle filters for both single and multiple target scenarios. The method was studied using a 3D simulation and a drone-based image segmentation sequence with global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-based camera pose estimates. The results showed that a particle filter can be used to solve practical localisation tasks based on camera poses and image segments in these situations where other solutions fail. The particle filter is independent of the detection method, making it flexible for new tasks. The study also demonstrates that drone-based wildfire monitoring can be conducted using the proposed method paired with a pre-existing image segmentation model.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we explore this complex task and introduce a framework named "FSMODNet" that leverages cross-modality feature integration to improve detection performance even with limited labels. By effectively combining the unique strengths of visible and thermal imagery using deformable attention, the proposed method demonstrates robust adaptability in complex illumination and environmental conditions. Experimental results on two public datasets show effective object detection performance in challenging low-data regimes, outperforming several baselines we established from state-of-the-art models.

| **[Punching Above Precision: Small Quantized Model Distillation with Learnable Regularizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20854v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization-aware training (QAT) combined with knowledge distillation (KD) is a promising strategy for compressing Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for deployment on resource-constrained hardware. However, existing QAT-KD methods often struggle to balance task-specific (TS) and distillation losses due to heterogeneous gradient magnitudes, especially under low-bit quantization. We propose Game of Regularizer (GoR), a novel learnable regularization method that adaptively balances TS and KD objectives using only two trainable parameters for dynamic loss weighting. GoR reduces conflict between supervision signals, improves convergence, and boosts the performance of small quantized models (SQMs). Experiments on image classification, object detection (OD), and large language model (LLM) compression show that GoR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art QAT-KD methods. On low-power edge devices, it delivers faster inference while maintaining full-precision accuracy. We also introduce QAT-EKD-GoR, an ensemble distillation framework that uses multiple heterogeneous teacher models. Under optimal conditions, the proposed EKD-GoR can outperform full-precision models, providing a robust solution for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Object Detection Meets DINOv3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20787v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Benefiting from the simplicity and effectiveness of Dense O2O and MAL, DEIM has become the mainstream training framework for real-time DETRs, significantly outperforming the YOLO series. In this work, we extend it with DINOv3 features, resulting in DEIMv2. DEIMv2 spans eight model sizes from X to Atto, covering GPU, edge, and mobile deployment. For the X, L, M, and S variants, we adopt DINOv3-pretrained or distilled backbones and introduce a Spatial Tuning Adapter (STA), which efficiently converts DINOv3's single-scale output into multi-scale features and complements strong semantics with fine-grained details to enhance detection. For ultra-lightweight models (Nano, Pico, Femto, and Atto), we employ HGNetv2 with depth and width pruning to meet strict resource budgets. Together with a simplified decoder and an upgraded Dense O2O, this unified design enables DEIMv2 to achieve a superior performance-cost trade-off across diverse scenarios, establishing new state-of-the-art results. Notably, our largest model, DEIMv2-X, achieves 57.8 AP with only 50.3 million parameters, surpassing prior X-scale models that require over 60 million parameters for just 56.5 AP. On the compact side, DEIMv2-S is the first sub-10 million model (9.71 million) to exceed the 50 AP milestone on COCO, reaching 50.9 AP. Even the ultra-lightweight DEIMv2-Pico, with just 1.5 million parameters, delivers 38.5 AP, matching YOLOv10-Nano (2.3 million) with around 50 percent fewer parameters.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we propose Neptune-X, a data-centric generative-selection framework that enhances training effectiveness by leveraging synthetic data generation with task-aware sample selection. From the generation perspective, we develop X-to-Maritime, a multi-modality-conditioned generative model that synthesizes diverse and realistic maritime scenes. A key component is the Bidirectional Object-Water Attention module, which captures boundary interactions between objects and their aquatic surroundings to improve visual fidelity. To further improve downstream tasking performance, we propose Attribute-correlated Active Sampling, which dynamically selects synthetic samples based on their task relevance. To support robust benchmarking, we construct the Maritime Generation Dataset, the first dataset tailored for generative maritime learning, encompassing a wide range of semantic conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new benchmark in maritime scene synthesis, significantly improving detection accuracy, particularly in challenging and previously underrepresented settings.The code is available at https://github.com/gy65896/Neptune-X.</p></details> |  |
| **[Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins (BIM2RDT): An Agentic AI Safety-First Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20705v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of cyber-physical systems and jobsite intelligence that connects design models, real-time site sensing, and autonomous field operations can dramatically enhance digital management in the construction industry. This paper introduces BIM2RDT (Building Information Models to Robot-Ready Site Digital Twins), an agentic artificial intelligence (AI) framework designed to transform static Building Information Modeling (BIM) into dynamic, robot-ready digital twins (DTs) that prioritize safety during execution. The framework bridges the gap between pre-existing BIM data and real-time site conditions by integrating three key data streams: geometric and semantic information from BIM models, activity data from IoT sensor networks, and visual-spatial data collected by robots during site traversal. The methodology introduces Semantic-Gravity ICP (SG-ICP), a point cloud registration algorithm that leverages large language model (LLM) reasoning. Unlike traditional methods, SG-ICP utilizes an LLM to infer object-specific, plausible orientation priors based on BIM semantics, improving alignment accuracy by avoiding convergence on local minima. This creates a feedback loop where robot-collected data updates the DT, which in turn optimizes paths for missions. The framework employs YOLOE object detection and Shi-Tomasi corner detection to identify and track construction elements while using BIM geometry as a priori maps. The framework also integrates real-time Hand-Arm Vibration (HAV) monitoring, mapping sensor-detected safety events to the digital twin using IFC standards for intervention. Experiments demonstrate SG-ICP's superiority over standard ICP, achieving RMSE reductions of 64.3%--88.3% in alignment across scenarios with occluded features, ensuring plausible orientations. HAV integration triggers warnings upon exceeding exposure limits, enhancing compliance with ISO 5349-1.</p></details> |  |
| **[Model Agnostic Defense against Adversarial Patch Attacks on Object Detection in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19179v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection forms a key component in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for completing high-level tasks that depend on the awareness of objects on the ground from an aerial perspective. In that scenario, adversarial patch attacks on an onboard object detector can severely impair the performance of upstream tasks. This paper proposes a novel model-agnostic defense mechanism against the threat of adversarial patch attacks in the context of UAV-based object detection. We formulate adversarial patch defense as an occlusion removal task. The proposed defense method can neutralize adversarial patches located on objects of interest, without exposure to adversarial patches during training. Our lightweight single-stage defense approach allows us to maintain a model-agnostic nature, that once deployed does not require to be updated in response to changes in the object detection pipeline. The evaluations in digital and physical domains show the feasibility of our method for deployment in UAV object detection pipelines, by significantly decreasing the Attack Success Ratio without incurring significant processing costs. As a result, the proposed defense solution can improve the reliability of object detection for UAVs.</p></details> | <details><summary>publi...</summary><p>published in IROS 2024</p></details> |

However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figure detection approach based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv12 object detection architecture. Our method achieved an F1-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set (hotspots only) and ranked second on the final test leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.7216 across complex and heterogeneous whole-slide regions, without relying on external data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02876v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual grounding focuses on detecting objects from images based on language expressions. Recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced visual grounding performance by training large models with large-scale datasets. However, the problem remains challenging, especially when similar objects appear in the input image. For example, an LVLM may not be able to differentiate Diet Coke and regular Coke in an image. In this case, if additional reference images of Diet Coke and regular Coke are available, it can help the visual grounding of similar objects. In this work, we introduce a new task named Multimodal Reference Visual Grounding (MRVG). In this task, a model has access to a set of reference images of objects in a database. Based on these reference images and a language expression, the model is required to detect a target object from a query image. We first introduce a new dataset to study the MRVG problem. Then we introduce a novel method, named MRVG-Net, to solve this visual grounding problem. We show that by efficiently using reference images with few-shot object detection and using Large Language Models (LLMs) for object matching, our method achieves superior visual grounding performance compared to the state-of-the-art LVLMs such as Qwen2.5-VL-72B. Our approach bridges the gap between few-shot detection and visual grounding, unlocking new capabilities for visual understanding, which has wide applications in robotics.

This transformation emerged from simple primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified, generalist vision foundation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://video-zero-shot.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[SpaRC: Sparse Radar-Camera Fusion for 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19860v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present SpaRC, a novel Sparse fusion transformer for 3D perception that integrates multi-view image semantics with Radar and Camera point features. The fusion of radar and camera modalities has emerged as an efficient perception paradigm for autonomous driving systems. While conventional approaches utilize dense Bird's Eye View (BEV)-based architectures for depth estimation, contemporary query-based transformers excel in camera-only detection through object-centric methodology. However, these query-based approaches exhibit limitations in false positive detections and localization precision due to implicit depth modeling. We address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) sparse frustum fusion (SFF) for cross-modal feature alignment, (2) range-adaptive radar aggregation (RAR) for precise object localization, and (3) local self-attention (LSA) for focused query aggregation. In contrast to existing methods requiring computationally intensive BEV-grid rendering, SpaRC operates directly on encoded point features, yielding substantial improvements in efficiency and accuracy. Empirical evaluations on the nuScenes and TruckScenes benchmarks demonstrate that SpaRC significantly outperforms existing dense BEV-based and sparse query-based detectors. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance metrics of 67.1 NDS and 63.1 AMOTA.

Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.724 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.</p></details> | Camera-ready copy |

Our approach ensures the selection of representative examples that improve model generalization. We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9. Our results demonstrate that AL-based example selection significantly outperforms random sampling, reducing annotation effort given a limited budget while maintaining comparable performance to fully supervised models.

However, detecting Shatian pomelo in complex orchard environments poses significant challenges, including multi-scale issues, obstructions from trunks and leaves, small object detection, etc. To address these issues, this study constructs a custom dataset STP-AgriData and proposes the SDE-DET model for Shatian pomelo detection. SDE-DET first utilizes the Star Block to effectively acquire high-dimensional information without increasing the computational overhead. Furthermore, the presented model adopts Deformable Attention in its backbone, to enhance its ability to detect pomelos under occluded conditions. Finally, multiple Efficient Multi-Scale Attention mechanisms are integrated into our model to reduce the computational overhead and extract deep visual representations, thereby improving the capacity for small object detection. In the experiment, we compared SDE-DET with the Yolo series and other mainstream detection models in Shatian pomelo detection. The presented SDE-DET model achieved scores of 0.883, 0.771, 0.838, 0.497, and 0.823 in Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, mAP@0.5:0.95 and F1-score, respectively. SDE-DET has achieved state-of-the-art performance on the STP-AgriData dataset. Experiments indicate that the SDE-DET provides a reliable method for Shatian pomelo detection, laying the foundation for the further development of automatic harvest robots.</p></details> |  |

Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU. The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses.

To address this, this paper proposes an adaptive guidance-based semantic enhancement edge-cloud collaborative object detection method leveraging Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM), achieving an effective balance between accuracy and efficiency. Specifically, the method first employs instruction fine-tuning to enable the MLLM to generate structured scene descriptions. It then designs an adaptive mapping mechanism that dynamically converts semantic information into parameter adjustment signals for edge detectors, achieving real-time semantic enhancement. Within an edge-cloud collaborative inference framework, the system automatically selects between invoking cloud-based semantic guidance or directly outputting edge detection results based on confidence scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method effectively enhances detection accuracy and efficiency in complex scenes. Specifically, it can reduce latency by over 79% and computational cost by 70% in low-light and highly occluded scenes while maintaining accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Most existing 2D/3D attacks are developed in task silos, lack mechanisms to induce controllable depth bias, and offer no standardized protocol to quantify cross-task transfer, leaving the interaction between detection and depth underexplored. We present BiTAA, a bi-task adversarial attack built on 3D Gaussian Splatting that yields a single perturbation capable of simultaneously degrading detection and biasing monocular depth. Specifically, we introduce a dual-model attack framework that supports both full-image and patch settings and is compatible with common detectors and depth estimators, with optional expectation-over-transformation (EOT) for physical reality. In addition, we design a composite loss that couples detection suppression with a signed, magnitude-controlled log-depth bias within regions of interest (ROIs) enabling controllable near or far misperception while maintaining stable optimization across tasks. We also propose a unified evaluation protocol with cross-task transfer metrics and real-world evaluations, showing consistent cross-task degradation and a clear asymmetry between Det to Depth and from Depth to Det transfer. The results highlight practical risks for multi-task camera-only perception and motivate cross-task-aware defenses in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Inten...</summary><p>Intend to submit to RA-L</p></details> |

However, this advantage comes at the cost of high bandwidth, memory, and computational demands. To address this, prior work has explored event downsampling, but most approaches rely on fixed heuristics or threshold-based strategies, limiting their adaptability. Instead, we propose a probabilistic framework, POLED, that models event importance through an event-importance probability density function (ePDF), which can be arbitrarily defined and adapted to different applications. Our approach operates in a purely online setting, estimating event importance on-the-fly from raw event streams, enabling scene-specific adaptation. Additionally, we introduce zero-shot event downsampling, where downsampled events must remain usable for models trained on the original event stream, without task-specific adaptation. We design a contour-preserving ePDF that prioritizes structurally important events and evaluate our method across four datasets and tasks--object classification, image interpolation, surface normal estimation, and object detection--demonstrating that intelligent sampling is crucial for maintaining performance under event-budget constraints.

| **[Look as You Leap: Planning Simultaneous Motion and Perception for High-DOF Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19610v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the problem of planning robot motions for a high-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robot that effectively achieves a given perception task while the robot and the perception target move in a dynamic environment. Achieving navigation and perception tasks simultaneously is challenging, as these objectives often impose conflicting requirements. Existing methods that compute motion under perception constraints fail to account for obstacles, are designed for low-DoF robots, or rely on simplified models of perception. Furthermore, in dynamic real-world environments, robots must replan and react quickly to changes and directly evaluating the quality of perception (e.g., object detection confidence) is often expensive or infeasible at runtime. This problem is especially important in human-centered environments such as homes and hospitals, where effective perception is essential for safe and reliable operation. To address these challenges, we propose a GPU-parallelized perception-score-guided probabilistic roadmap planner with a neural surrogate model (PS-PRM). The planner explicitly incorporates the estimated quality of a perception task into motion planning for high-DoF robots. Our method uses a learned model to approximate perception scores and leverages GPU parallelism to enable efficient online replanning in dynamic settings. We demonstrate that our planner, evaluated on high-DoF robots, outperforms baseline methods in both static and dynamic environments in both simulation and real-robot experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 10 figures, under review</p></details> |

Its robustness against adverse weather conditions makes it a suitable choice for radar object detection in advanced driver assistance systems. These real-time embedded systems have requirements for the compactness and efficiency of the model, which have been largely overlooked in previous work. In this work, we propose mRadNet, a novel radar object detection model with compactness in mind. mRadNet employs a U-net style architecture with MetaFormer blocks, in which separable convolution and attention token mixers are used to capture both local and global features effectively. More efficient token embedding and merging strategies are introduced to further facilitate the lightweight design. The performance of mRadNet is validated on the CRUW dataset, improving state-of-the-art performance with the least number of parameters and FLOPs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, submitted to IEEE ICASSP 2026.

When left undetected, polyps can become malignant tumors. Colonoscopy is the standard procedure for detecting polyps, as it enables direct visualization and removal of suspicious lesions. Manual detection by colonoscopy can be inconsistent and is subject to oversight. Therefore, object detection based on deep learning offers a better solution for a more accurate and real-time diagnosis during colonoscopy. In this work, we propose YOLO-LAN, a YOLO-based polyp detection pipeline, trained using M2IoU loss, versatile data augmentations and negative data to replicate real clinical situations. Our pipeline outperformed existing methods for the Kvasir-seg and BKAI-IGH NeoPolyp datasets, achieving mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9619, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8599 with YOLOv12 and mAP$_{50}$ of 0.9540, mAP$_{50:95}$ of 0.8487 with YOLOv8 on the Kvasir-seg dataset. The significant increase is achieved in mAP$_{50:95}$ score, showing the precision of polyp detection. We show robustness based on polyp size and precise location detection, making it clinically relevant in AI-assisted colorectal screening.</p></details> |  |

Their success relies on 3D vision systems that effectively sense the environment and detect traffic agents. Among sensors AVs use to create a comprehensive view of surroundings, LiDAR provides high-resolution depth data enabling accurate object detection, safe navigation, and collision avoidance. However, collecting real-world LiDAR data is time-consuming and often affected by noise and sparsity due to adverse weather or sensor limitations. This work applies a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM), enhanced with novel noise scheduling and time-step embedding techniques to generate high-quality synthetic data for augmentation, thereby improving performance across a range of computer vision tasks, particularly in AV perception. These modifications impact the denoising process and the model's temporal awareness, allowing it to produce more realistic point clouds based on the projection. The proposed method was extensively evaluated under various configurations using the IAMCV and KITTI-360 datasets, with four performance metrics compared against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The results demonstrate the model's superior performance over most existing baselines and its effectiveness in mitigating the effects of noisy and sparse LiDAR data, producing diverse point clouds with rich spatial relationships and structural detail.</p></details> |  |

SGG shows significant promise as a foundational component for downstream tasks, such as reasoning for embodied agents. To enable real-time applications, SGG must address the trade-off between performance and inference speed. However, current methods tend to focus on one of the following: (1) improving relation prediction accuracy, (2) enhancing object detection accuracy, or (3) reducing latency, without aiming to balance all three objectives simultaneously. To address this limitation, we propose the Real-time Efficiency and Accuracy Compromise for Tradeoffs in Scene Graph Generation (REACT) architecture, which achieves the highest inference speed among existing SGG models, improving object detection accuracy without sacrificing relation prediction performance. Compared to state-of-the-art approaches, REACT is 2.7 times faster and improves object detection accuracy by 58\%. Furthermore, our proposal significantly reduces model size, with an average of 5.5x fewer parameters.

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.724 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.</p></details> | Camera-ready copy |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

| **[An Analysis of Kalman Filter based Object Tracking Methods for Fast-Moving Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18451v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[StereoFoley: Object-Aware Stereo Audio Generation from Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18272v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present StereoFoley, a video-to-audio generation framework that produces semantically aligned, temporally synchronized, and spatially accurate stereo sound at 48 kHz. While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSEv2: A More Challenging Dataset for Video Object Segmentation in Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05630v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the foundations and insights of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces much greater scene complexity, including {more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and scenarios requiring external knowledge.} We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops on MOSEv2. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and observe similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 poses challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite strong performance on existing datasets, current VOS methods still fall short under real-world complexities. Based on our analysis of the observed challenges, we further propose several practical tricks that enhance model performance. MOSEv2 is publicly available at https://MOSE.video.</p></details> | <details><summary>MOSEv...</summary><p>MOSEv2 Dataset Report, Project Page: https://mose.video/, Baseline & metric code: https://github.com/henghuiding/MOSE-api</p></details> |

Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy, stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author requires to do so</p></details> |

LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distractor-Aware Memory-Based Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13864v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on Github: https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM</p></details> |

The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page Journal paper, accepted by IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy</p></details> |

While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

| **[Motion Estimation for Multi-Object Tracking using KalmanNet with Semantic-Independent Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11323v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT). It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters. The code is available at (https://github.com/SongJgit/filternet and https://github.com/SongJgit/TBDTracker).</p></details> |  |
| **[ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

| **[An HMM-based framework for identity-aware long-term multi-object tracking from sparse and uncertain identification: use case on long-term tracking in livestock](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09962v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes. Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted at CVPR animal workshop 2024, submitted to IJCV</p></details> |

This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

| **[Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.</p></details> |  |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms.

| **[Hyperspectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08265v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images, which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.</p></details> |  |

Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depthwise-Dilated Convolutional Adapters for Medical Object Tracking and Segmentation Using the Segment Anything Model 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14613v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking.

The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames.

Combined with comprehensive pipeline optimizations like text encoder restructuring and specialized quantization, our system enables both rapid generation and memory-efficient deployment across different hardware configurations. This democratizes access across the full spectrum of devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers.

Recent studies have explored VLM robustness against jailbreak attacks-techniques that exploit model vulnerabilities to elicit harmful outputs. However, the limited availability of diverse multimodal data has constrained current approaches to rely heavily on adversarial or manually crafted images derived from harmful text datasets, which often lack effectiveness and diversity across different contexts. In this paper, we propose IDEATOR, a novel jailbreak method that autonomously generates malicious image-text pairs for black-box jailbreak attacks. IDEATOR is grounded in the insight that VLMs themselves could serve as powerful red team models for generating multimodal jailbreak prompts. Specifically, IDEATOR leverages a VLM to create targeted jailbreak texts and pairs them with jailbreak images generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model. Extensive experiments demonstrate IDEATOR's high effectiveness and transferability, achieving a 94% attack success rate (ASR) in jailbreaking MiniGPT-4 with an average of only 5.34 queries, and high ASRs of 82%, 88%, and 75% when transferred to LLaVA, InstructBLIP, and Chameleon, respectively. Building on IDEATOR's strong transferability and automated process, we introduce the VLJailbreakBench, a safety benchmark comprising 3,654 multimodal jailbreak samples. Our benchmark results on 11 recently released VLMs reveal significant gaps in safety alignment. For instance, our challenge set achieves ASRs of 46.31% on GPT-4o and 19.65% on Claude-3.5-Sonnet, underscoring the urgent need for stronger defenses.

| **[Evaluating the Evaluators: Metrics for Compositional Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21227v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-image generation has advanced rapidly, but assessing whether outputs truly capture the objects, attributes, and relations described in prompts remains a central challenge. Evaluation in this space relies heavily on automated metrics, yet these are often adopted by convention or popularity rather than validated against human judgment. Because evaluation and reported progress in the field depend directly on these metrics, it is critical to understand how well they reflect human preferences. To address this, we present a broad study of widely used metrics for compositional text-image evaluation. Our analysis goes beyond simple correlation, examining their behavior across diverse compositional challenges and comparing how different metric families align with human judgments. The results show that no single metric performs consistently across tasks: performance varies with the type of compositional problem. Notably, VQA-based metrics, though popular, are not uniformly superior, while certain embedding-based metrics prove stronger in specific cases. Image-only metrics, as expected, contribute little to compositional evaluation, as they are designed for perceptual quality rather than alignment. These findings underscore the importance of careful and transparent metric selection, both for trustworthy evaluation and for their use as reward models in generation.

| **[Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10568v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Unwinnable Arms Race of AI Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21135v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of image generative AI has blurred the boundary between synthetic and real images, fueling an arms race between generators and discriminators. This paper investigates the conditions under which discriminators are most disadvantaged in this competition. We analyze two key factors: data dimensionality and data complexity. While increased dimensionality often strengthens the discriminators ability to detect subtle inconsistencies, complexity introduces a more nuanced effect. Using Kolmogorov complexity as a measure of intrinsic dataset structure, we show that both very simple and highly complex datasets reduce the detectability of synthetic images; generators can learn simple datasets almost perfectly, whereas extreme diversity masks imperfections. In contrast, intermediate-complexity datasets create the most favorable conditions for detection, as generators fail to fully capture the distribution and their errors remain visible.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Single Neuron Works: Precise Concept Erasure in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21008v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models exhibit remarkable capabilities in image generation. However, they also pose safety risks of generating harmful content. A key challenge of existing concept erasure methods is the precise removal of target concepts while minimizing degradation of image quality. In this paper, we propose Single Neuron-based Concept Erasure (SNCE), a novel approach that can precisely prevent harmful content generation by manipulating only a single neuron. Specifically, we train a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) to map text embeddings into a sparse, disentangled latent space, where individual neurons align tightly with atomic semantic concepts. To accurately locate neurons responsible for harmful concepts, we design a novel neuron identification method based on the modulated frequency scoring of activation patterns. By suppressing activations of the harmful concept-specific neuron, SNCE achieves surgical precision in concept erasure with minimal disruption to image quality. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that SNCE achieves state-of-the-art results in target concept erasure, while preserving the model's generation capabilities for non-target concepts. Additionally, our method exhibits strong robustness against adversarial attacks, significantly outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |

The generative reverse process is derandomized by introducing a variant of the herding algorithm with weakly chaotic dynamics, which induces deterministic discrete state transitions. Our approach is a direct replacement for the stochastic denoising process, requiring neither retraining nor continuous state embeddings. We demonstrate consistent improvements in both efficiency and sample quality on text and image generation tasks. Thus, this simple derandomization approach is expected to enhance the significance of discrete diffusion in generative modeling. Furthermore, our results reveal that deterministic reverse processes, well established in continuous diffusion, can also be effective in discrete state spaces.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

To address this issue, we explore two artifact types introduced during the generation process: (1) latent distribution deviations and (2) decoding-induced smoothing effects, which manifest as inconsistencies in local textures, edges, and color transitions. Leveraging local pixel dependencies (LPD) properties rooted in Markov Random Fields, we reconstruct synthetic images using neighboring pixel information to expose disruptions in texture continuity and edge coherence. Building upon LPD, we propose FerretNet, a lightweight neural network with only 1.1M parameters that delivers efficient and robust synthetic image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FerretNet, trained exclusively on the 4-class ProGAN dataset, achieves an average accuracy of 97.1% on an open-world benchmark comprising across 22 generative models, surpassing state-of-the-art methods by 10.6%.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables, accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Understanding-in-Generation: Reinforcing Generative Capability of Unified Model via Infusing Understanding into Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18639v3)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have made notable advancements in enhancing unified models for text-to-image generation through the Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, these reasoning methods separate the processes of understanding and generation, which limits their ability to guide the reasoning of unified models in addressing the deficiencies of their generative capabilities. To this end, we propose a novel reasoning framework for unified models, Understanding-in-Generation (UiG), which harnesses the robust understanding capabilities of unified models to reinforce their performance in image generation. The core insight of our UiG is to integrate generative guidance by the strong understanding capabilities during the reasoning process, thereby mitigating the limitations of generative abilities. To achieve this, we introduce "Image Editing" as a bridge to infuse understanding into the generation process. Initially, we verify the generated image and incorporate the understanding of unified models into the editing instructions. Subsequently, we enhance the generated image step by step, gradually infusing the understanding into the generation process. Our UiG framework demonstrates a significant performance improvement in text-to-image generation over existing text-to-image reasoning methods, e.g., a 3.92% gain on the long prompt setting of the TIIF benchmark.

| **[Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error for Detecting AI-Generated Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09487v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, AI-generated image detection has gained increasing attention, as the rapid advancement of image generation technologies has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models, since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts and thus overfit to the models used for training. To address this limitation, we propose a novel representation, namely Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The key hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images, which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE provides a robust and discriminative feature for detecting fake images across diverse generative models. Additionally, we introduce a fusion module that integrates SARE into the backbone detector via a cross-attention mechanism. Image features attend to semantic representations extracted from SARE, enabling the model to adaptively leverage semantic information. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves strong generalization, outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and ForenSynths. We further validate the effectiveness of caption guidance through a detailed analysis of semantic shifts, confirming its ability to enhance detection robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[FreeInsert: Personalized Object Insertion with Geometric and Style Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20756v1)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have made significant progress in image generation, allowing for effortless customized generation. However, existing image editing methods still face certain limitations when dealing with personalized image composition tasks. First, there is the issue of lack of geometric control over the inserted objects. Current methods are confined to 2D space and typically rely on textual instructions, making it challenging to maintain precise geometric control over the objects. Second, there is the challenge of style consistency. Existing methods often overlook the style consistency between the inserted object and the background, resulting in a lack of realism. In addition, the challenge of inserting objects into images without extensive training remains significant. To address these issues, we propose \textit{FreeInsert}, a novel training-free framework that customizes object insertion into arbitrary scenes by leveraging 3D geometric information. Benefiting from the advances in existing 3D generation models, we first convert the 2D object into 3D, perform interactive editing at the 3D level, and then re-render it into a 2D image from a specified view. This process introduces geometric controls such as shape or view. The rendered image, serving as geometric control, is combined with style and content control achieved through diffusion adapters, ultimately producing geometrically controlled, style-consistent edited images via the diffusion model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Layout-to-Image Generation with Marginal Attention Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10495v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, many text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-resolution images from text but struggle with precise control over spatial composition and object counting. To address these challenges, prior works developed layout-to-image (L2I) approaches that incorporate layout instructions into text-to-image models. However, existing L2I methods typically require fine-tuning of pre-trained parameters or training additional control modules for the diffusion models. In this work, we propose a training-free L2I approach, MAC (Marginal Attention Constrained Generation), which eliminates the need for additional modules or fine-tuning. Specifically, we use text-visual cross-attention feature maps to quantify inconsistencies between the layout of the generated images and the provided instructions, and then compute loss functions to optimize latent features during the diffusion reverse process. To enhance spatial controllability and mitigate semantic failures in complex layout instructions, we leverage pixel-to-pixel correlations in the self-attention feature maps to align cross-attention maps and combine three loss functions constrained by boundary attention to update latent features. Comprehensive experimental results on both L2I and non-L2I pretrained diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms existing training-free L2I techniques both quantitatively and qualitatively in terms of image composition on the DrawBench and HRS benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

The approach is distinguished by three key innovations: (i) MMaDA adopts a unified diffusion architecture with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components. This architecture ensures seamless integration and processing across different data types. (ii) We implement a mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities. By aligning reasoning processes between textual and visual domains, this strategy facilitates cold-start training for the final reinforcement learning (RL) stage, thereby enhancing the model's ability to handle complex tasks from the outset. (iii) We propose UniGRPO, a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm specifically tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, UniGRPO unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements. Experimental results demonstrate that MMaDA-8B exhibits strong generalization capabilities as a unified multimodal foundation model. It surpasses powerful models like LLaMA-3-7B and Qwen2-7B in textual reasoning, outperforms Show-o and SEED-X in multimodal understanding, and excels over SDXL and Janus in text-to-image generation. These achievements highlight MMaDA's effectiveness in bridging the gap between pretraining and post-training within unified diffusion architectures, providing a comprehensive framework for future research and development. We open-source our code and trained models at: https://github.com/Gen-Verse/MMaDA</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

A computationally efficient and scalable formulation of virtual try-on formulates the problem as an image-guided or image-conditioned inpainting task. These inpainting-based virtual try-on models commonly use a binary mask to control the generation layout. Producing a mask that yields desirable result is difficult, requires background knowledge, might be model dependent, and in some cases impossible with the masking-based approach (e.g. trying on a long-sleeve shirt with "sleeves rolled up" styling on a person wearing long-sleeve shirt with sleeves down, where the mask will necessarily cover the entire sleeve). InstructVTON leverages Vision Language Models (VLMs) and image segmentation models for automated binary mask generation. These masks are generated based on user-provided images and free-text style instructions. InstructVTON simplifies the end-user experience by removing the necessity of a precisely drawn mask, and by automating execution of multiple rounds of image generation for try-on scenarios that cannot be achieved with masking-based virtual try-on models alone. We show that InstructVTON is interoperable with existing virtual try-on models to achieve state-of-the-art results with styling control.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2025 and Published at CVPR 2025 AI for Content Creation workshop</p></details> |

While image generation and editing have rapidly transitioned from task-specific to unified frameworks, video generation and editing remain fragmented due to architectural limitations and data scarcity. In this work, we introduce EditVerse, a unified framework for image and video generation and editing within a single model. By representing all modalities, i.e., text, image, and video, as a unified token sequence, EditVerse leverages self-attention to achieve robust in-context learning, natural cross-modal knowledge transfer, and flexible handling of inputs and outputs with arbitrary resolutions and durations. To address the lack of video editing training data, we design a scalable data pipeline that curates 232K video editing samples and combines them with large-scale image and video datasets for joint training. Furthermore, we present EditVerseBench, the first benchmark for instruction-based video editing covering diverse tasks and resolutions. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that EditVerse achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing open-source and commercial models, while exhibiting emergent editing and generation abilities across modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seedream 4.0: Toward Next-generation Multimodal Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20427v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Seedream 4.0, an efficient and high-performance multimodal image generation system that unifies text-to-image (T2I) synthesis, image editing, and multi-image composition within a single framework. We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications. Seedream 4.0 is now accessible on https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?launch=seedream.</p></details> | <details><summary>Seedr...</summary><p>Seedream 4.0 Technical Report</p></details> |
| **[LEDiT: Your Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer without Positional Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04344v3)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion transformers (DiTs) struggle to generate images at resolutions higher than their training resolutions. The primary obstacle is that the explicit positional encodings(PE), such as RoPE, need extrapolating to unseen positions which degrades performance when the inference resolution differs from training. In this paper, We propose a Length-Extrapolatable Diffusion Transformer~(LEDiT) to overcome this limitation. LEDiT needs no explicit PEs, thereby avoiding PE extrapolation. The key innovation of LEDiT lies in the use of causal attention. We demonstrate that causal attention can implicitly encode global positional information and show that such information facilitates extrapolation. We further introduce a locality enhancement module, which captures fine-grained local information to complement the global coarse-grained position information encoded by causal attention. Experimental results on both conditional and text-to-image generation tasks demonstrate that LEDiT supports up to 4x resolution scaling (e.g., from 256x256 to 512x512), achieving better image quality compared to the state-of-the-art length extrapolation methods. We believe that LEDiT marks a departure from the standard RoPE-based methods and offers a promising insight into length extrapolation.

| **[Biologically Plausible Learning via Bidirectional Spike-Based Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20284v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing biologically plausible learning algorithms that can achieve performance comparable to error backpropagation remains a longstanding challenge. Existing approaches often compromise biological plausibility by entirely avoiding the use of spikes for error propagation or relying on both positive and negative learning signals, while the question of how spikes can represent negative values remains unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce Bidirectional Spike-based Distillation (BSD), a novel learning algorithm that jointly trains a feedforward and a backward spiking network. We formulate learning as a transformation between two spiking representations (i.e., stimulus encoding and concept encoding) so that the feedforward network implements perception and decision-making by mapping stimuli to actions, while the backward network supports memory recall by reconstructing stimuli from concept representations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including image recognition, image generation, and sequential regression, show that BSD achieves performance comparable to networks trained with classical error backpropagation. These findings represent a significant step toward biologically grounded, spike-driven learning in neural networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learnable Sampler Distillation for Discrete Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19962v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps.

Unlike existing multimodal MDMs such as MMaDa and Muddit which only support simple image-level understanding tasks and low-resolution image generation, Lavida-O presents a single framework that enables image-level understanding, object grounding, image editing, and high-resolution (1024px) text-to-image synthesis. Lavida-O incorporates a novel Elastic Mixture-of-Transformers (Elastic-MoT) architecture that couples a lightweight generation branch with a larger understanding branch, supported by token compression, universal text conditioning and stratified sampling for efficient and high-quality generation. Lavida-O further incorporates planning and iterative self-reflection in image generation and editing tasks, seamlessly boosting generation quality with its understanding capabilities. Lavida-O achieves state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of benchmarks including RefCOCO object grounding, GenEval text-to-image generation, and ImgEdit image editing, outperforming existing autoregressive models and continuous diffusion models such as Qwen2.5-VL and FluxKontext-dev, while offering considerable speedup at inference. These advances establish Lavida-O as a new paradigm for scalable multimodal reasoning and generation.</p></details> | 31 pages, 15 figures |

However, their safety and robustness against adversarial attacks remain largely underexplored. In this work, we identify and formalize a critical adversarial vulnerability in which adversarial images can "freeze" VLA models and cause them to ignore subsequent instructions. This threat effectively disconnects the robot's digital mind from its physical actions, potentially inducing inaction during critical interventions. To systematically study this vulnerability, we propose FreezeVLA, a novel attack framework that generates and evaluates action-freezing attacks via min-max bi-level optimization. Experiments on three state-of-the-art VLA models and four robotic benchmarks show that FreezeVLA attains an average attack success rate of 76.2%, significantly outperforming existing methods. Moreover, adversarial images generated by FreezeVLA exhibit strong transferability, with a single image reliably inducing paralysis across diverse language prompts. Our findings expose a critical safety risk in VLA models and highlight the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining competitive image quality.

| **[MAME: Multidimensional Adaptive Metamer Exploration with Human Perceptual Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13212v2)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Alignment between human brain networks and artificial models has become an active research area in vision science and machine learning. A widely adopted approach is identifying "metamers," stimuli physically different yet perceptually equivalent within a system. However, conventional methods lack a direct approach to searching for the human metameric space. Instead, researchers first develop biologically inspired models and then infer about human metamers indirectly by testing whether model metamers also appear as metamers to humans. Here, we propose the Multidimensional Adaptive Metamer Exploration (MAME) framework, enabling direct, high-dimensional exploration of human metameric spaces through online image generation guided by human perceptual feedback. MAME modulates reference images across multiple dimensions based on hierarchical neural network responses, adaptively updating generation parameters according to participants' perceptual discriminability. Using MAME, we successfully measured multidimensional human metameric spaces within a single psychophysical experiment. Experimental results using a biologically plausible CNN model showed that human discrimination sensitivity was lower for metameric images based on low-level features compared to high-level features, which image contrast metrics could not explain. The finding suggests a relatively worse alignment between the metameric spaces of humans and the CNN model for low-level processing compared to high-level processing. Counterintuitively, given recent discussions on alignment at higher representational levels, our results highlight the importance of early visual computations in shaping biologically plausible models. Our MAME framework can serve as a future scientific tool for directly investigating the functional organization of human vision.</p></details> | 21 pages, 12 figures |

While classifier-free guidance (CFG) strategies have shown promising results in image generation, their application to speech synthesis are underexplored. Separating the conditions used for CFG enables trade-offs between different desired characteristics in speech synthesis. In this paper, we evaluate the adaptability of CFG strategies originally developed for image generation to speech synthesis and extend separated-condition CFG approaches for this domain. Our results show that CFG strategies effective in image generation generally fail to improve speech synthesis. We also find that we can improve speaker similarity while limiting degradation of text adherence by applying standard CFG during early timesteps and switching to selective CFG only in later timesteps. Surprisingly, we observe that the effectiveness of a selective CFG strategy is highly text-representation dependent, as differences between the two languages of English and Mandarin can lead to different results even with the same model.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 7 figures, 1 table.

| **[Synthesizing Artifact Dataset for Pixel-level Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19589v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artifact detectors have been shown to enhance the performance of image-generative models by serving as reward models during fine-tuning. These detectors enable the generative model to improve overall output fidelity and aesthetics. However, training the artifact detector requires expensive pixel-level human annotations that specify the artifact regions. The lack of annotated data limits the performance of the artifact detector. A naive pseudo-labeling approach-training a weak detector and using it to annotate unlabeled images-suffers from noisy labels, resulting in poor performance. To address this, we propose an artifact corruption pipeline that automatically injects artifacts into clean, high-quality synthetic images on a predetermined region, thereby producing pixel-level annotations without manual labeling. The proposed method enables training of an artifact detector that achieves performance improvements of 13.2% for ConvNeXt and 3.7% for Swin-T, as verified on human-labeled data, compared to baseline approaches. This work represents an initial step toward scalable pixel-level artifact annotation datasets that integrate world knowledge into artifact detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under submission to WACV</p></details> |

We identify two primary challenges: (1) large overlapping regions and (2) overlapping instances with minimal semantic distinction. Through both qualitative examples and quantitative analysis, we demonstrate how these factors degrade generation quality. To systematically assess this issue, we introduce OverLayScore, a novel metric that quantifies the complexity of overlapping bounding boxes. Our analysis reveals that existing benchmarks are biased toward simpler cases with low OverLayScore values, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating model performance under more challenging conditions. To bridge this gap, we present OverLayBench, a new benchmark featuring high-quality annotations and a balanced distribution across different levels of OverLayScore. As an initial step toward improving performance on complex overlaps, we also propose CreatiLayout-AM, a model fine-tuned on a curated amodal mask dataset. Together, our contributions lay the groundwork for more robust layout-to-image generation under realistic and challenging scenarios.

However, as contexts integrate increasingly numerous interleaved multimodal tokens, the iterative processes of diffusion denoising and autoregressive decoding impose significant computational overhead. To address this, we propose Hyper-Bagel, a unified acceleration framework designed to simultaneously speed up both multimodal understanding and generation tasks. Our approach uses a divide-and-conquer strategy, employing speculative decoding for next-token prediction and a multi-stage distillation process for diffusion denoising. The framework delivers substantial performance gains, achieving over a 2x speedup in multimodal understanding. For generative tasks, our resulting lossless 6-NFE model yields a 16.67x speedup in text-to-image generation and a 22x speedup in image editing, all while preserving the high-quality output of the original model. We further develop a highly efficient 1-NFE model that enables near real-time interactive editing and generation. By combining advanced adversarial distillation with human feedback learning, this model achieves ultimate cost-effectiveness and responsiveness, making complex multimodal interactions seamless and instantaneous.</p></details> | Technical Report |

While diffusion models can synthesize realistic images, they often suffer from data memorization, resulting in inconsistent or non-diverse samples that may fail to improve, or even harm, downstream performance. We introduce \emph{Surgical Application-Aligned Diffusion} (SAADi), a new framework that aligns diffusion models with samples preferred by downstream models. Our method constructs pairs of \emph{preferred} and \emph{non-preferred} synthetic images and employs lightweight fine-tuning of diffusion models to align the image generation process with downstream objectives explicitly. Experiments on three surgical datasets demonstrate consistent gains of $7$--$9\%$ in classification and $2$--$10\%$ in segmentation tasks, with the considerable improvements observed for underrepresented classes. Iterative refinement of synthetic samples further boosts performance by $4$--$10\%$. Unlike baseline approaches, our method overcomes sample degradation and establishes task-aware alignment as a key principle for mitigating data scarcity and advancing surgical vision applications.</p></details> |  |

However, data availability is often restricted in the medical domain due to patient privacy concerns. Synthetic data presents a possible solution to these challenges. Recently, image generative models have found increasing use for medical applications but are often designed for singular medical specialties and imaging modalities, thus limiting their broader utility. To address this, we introduce MediSyn: a text-guided, latent diffusion model capable of generating synthetic images from 6 medical specialties and 10 image types. Through extensive experimentation, we first demonstrate that MediSyn quantitatively matches or surpasses the performance of specialist models. Second, we show that our synthetic images are realistic and exhibit strong alignment with their corresponding text prompts, as validated by a team of expert physicians. Third, we provide empirical evidence that our synthetic images are visually distinct from their corresponding real patient images. Finally, we demonstrate that in data-limited settings, classifiers trained solely on synthetic data or real data supplemented with synthetic data can outperform those trained solely on real data. Our findings highlight the immense potential of generalist image generative models to accelerate algorithmic research and development in medicine.</p></details> |  |
| **[SparseDiT: Token Sparsification for Efficient Diffusion Transformer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06028v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiT) are renowned for their impressive generative performance; however, they are significantly constrained by considerable computational costs due to the quadratic complexity in self-attention and the extensive sampling steps required. While advancements have been made in expediting the sampling process, the underlying architectural inefficiencies within DiT remain underexplored. We introduce SparseDiT, a novel framework that implements token sparsification across spatial and temporal dimensions to enhance computational efficiency while preserving generative quality. Spatially, SparseDiT employs a tri-segment architecture that allocates token density based on feature requirements at each layer: Poolingformer in the bottom layers for efficient global feature extraction, Sparse-Dense Token Modules (SDTM) in the middle layers to balance global context with local detail, and dense tokens in the top layers to refine high-frequency details. Temporally, SparseDiT dynamically modulates token density across denoising stages, progressively increasing token count as finer details emerge in later timesteps. This synergy between SparseDiT spatially adaptive architecture and its temporal pruning strategy enables a unified framework that balances efficiency and fidelity throughout the generation process. Our experiments demonstrate SparseDiT effectiveness, achieving a 55% reduction in FLOPs and a 175% improvement in inference speed on DiT-XL with similar FID score on 512x512 ImageNet, a 56% reduction in FLOPs across video generation datasets, and a 69% improvement in inference speed on PixArt-$\alpha$ on text-to-image generation task with a 0.24 FID score decrease. SparseDiT provides a scalable solution for high-quality diffusion-based generation compatible with sampling optimization techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025)</p></details> |
