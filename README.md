| **[Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

| **[When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.</p></details> | BIBM |
| **[DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLSM-Ensemble: Ensembling CLIP-based Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05154v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL 2025) short paper</p></details> |
| **[TriCLIP-3D: A Unified Parameter-Efficient Framework for Tri-Modal 3D Visual Grounding based on CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14904v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChordPrompt: Orchestrating Cross-Modal Prompt Synergy for Multi-Domain Incremental Learning in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19608v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hues and Cues: Human vs. CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02305v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with the commonly used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures. 8th annual conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |
| **[Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20760v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> |
| **[Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15779v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

| **[Language-Aware Information Maximization for Transductive Few-Shot CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00305v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly, we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is publicly available at:\[ \href{https://github.com/ghassenbaklouti/LIMO}{\text{here}} \]</p></details> |  |
| **[EZ-Sort: Efficient Pairwise Comparison via Zero-Shot CLIP-Based Pre-Ordering and Human-in-the-Loop Sorting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21550v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at CIKM 2025 (ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management)</p></details> |
| **[InterCLIP-MEP: Interactive CLIP and Memory-Enhanced Predictor for Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16464v6)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcasm in social media, often expressed through text-image combinations, poses challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been demonstrated to overly rely on spurious cues within the textual modality, revealing a limited ability to genuinely identify sarcasm through nuanced text-image interactions. To solve this problem, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, which introduces Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) with an efficient training strategy to extract enriched text-image representations by embedding cross-modal information directly into each encoder. Additionally, we design a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP) with a dynamic dual-channel memory that stores valuable test sample knowledge during inference, acting as a non-parametric classifier for robust sarcasm recognition. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant accuracy and F1 score improvements on MMSD and MMSD2.0.

| **[Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP. In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, code:https://github.com/chi-chi-zx/FSA</p></details> |

However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins.

| **[From Global to Local: Social Bias Transfer in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17750v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases, learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all? We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias, finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally, we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge when adapted for downstream tasks.

The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution, and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters, each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

With the recent advances in vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant decoder, and the SAPG technique.

However, no existing metric effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP, on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 AI4VA workshop (oral), Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/wpclip</p></details> |

Instead of using a classifier, we generate centroids in the CLIP embedding space, and images are classified based on their relative distance to said centroids.

| **[Continual Learning on CLIP via Incremental Prompt Tuning with Intrinsic Textual Anchors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20680v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | Preprint |

These methods typically operate at the token level, leveraging internal representations to suppress superficial patterns. Nevertheless, LLMs remain prone to hallucinations, especially over longer contexts. In this paper, we propose Active Layer-Contrastive Decoding (ActLCD), a novel decoding strategy that actively decides when to apply contrasting layers during generation. By casting decoding as a sequential decision-making problem, ActLCD employs a reinforcement learning policy guided by a reward-aware classifier to optimize factuality beyond the token level. Our experiments demonstrate that ActLCD surpasses state-of-the-art methods across five benchmarks, showcasing its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in diverse generation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 3 figures, EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Through quantitative analysis, we observe that current VRMs exhibit limited visual reflection, as their attention to visual information diminishes rapidly with longer generated responses. To address this challenge, we propose a new VRM \textbf{Reflection-V}, which enhances visual reflection based on reasoning data construction for cold-start and reward design for reinforcement learning (RL). Firstly, we construct vision-centered reasoning data by leveraging an agent that interacts between VLMs and reasoning LLMs, enabling cold-start learning of visual reflection patterns. Secondly, a visual attention based reward model is employed during RL to encourage reasoning based on visual information. Therefore, \textbf{Reflection-V} demonstrates significant improvements across multiple visual reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, \textbf{Reflection-V} maintains a stronger and more consistent reliance on visual information during visual reasoning, indicating effective enhancement in visual reflection capabilities.</p></details> | EMNLP2025 Main |

Without centralized oversight, malicious actors coordinate shilling campaigns and pump-and-dump schemes across various platforms. We propose a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework for decentralized manipulation detection, modeling the interaction between manipulators and detectors as a dynamic adversarial game. This framework identifies suspicious patterns using delayed token price reactions as financial indicators.Our method introduces three innovations: (1) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enhance learning stability in sparse-reward and partially observable settings; (2) a theory-based reward function inspired by rational expectations and information asymmetry, differentiating price discovery from manipulation noise; and (3) a multi-modal agent pipeline that integrates LLM-based semantic features, social graph signals, and on-chain market data for informed decision-making.The framework is integrated within the Symphony system, a decentralized multi-agent architecture enabling peer-to-peer agent execution and trust-aware learning through distributed logs, supporting chain-verifiable evaluation. Symphony promotes adversarial co-evolution among strategic actors and maintains robust manipulation detection without centralized oracles, enabling real-time surveillance across global DeFi ecosystems.Trained on 100,000 real-world discourse episodes and validated in adversarial simulations, Hide-and-Shill achieves top performance in detection accuracy and causal attribution. This work bridges multi-agent systems with financial surveillance, advancing a new paradigm for decentralized market intelligence.

| **[$K$-Level Policy Gradients for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12117v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Actor-critic algorithms for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) typically employ a policy update that responds to the current strategies of other agents. While being straightforward, this approach does not account for the updates of other agents at the same update step, resulting in miscoordination. In this paper, we introduce the $K$-Level Policy Gradient (KPG), a method that recursively updates each agent against the updated policies of other agents, speeding up the discovery of effective coordinated policies. We theoretically prove that KPG with finite iterates achieves monotonic convergence to a local Nash equilibrium under certain conditions. We provide principled implementations of KPG by applying it to the deep MARL algorithms MAPPO, MADDPG, and FACMAC. Empirically, we demonstrate superior performance over existing deep MARL algorithms in StarCraft II and multi-agent MuJoCo.</p></details> |  |
| **[GTA: Supervised-Guided Reinforcement Learning for Text Classification with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12108v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In natural language processing tasks, pure reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods often suffer from inefficient exploration and slow convergence; while supervised fine-tuning (SFT) methods, although efficient in training, have limited performance ceiling and less solid theoretical foundation compared to RL. To address efficiency-capability trade-off, we propose the Guess-Think-Answer (GTA) framework that combines the efficiency of SFT with the capability gains of RL in a unified training paradigm. GTA works by having the model first produce a provisional guess (optimized via cross-entropy loss), then reflect on this guess before generating the final answer, with RL rewards shaping both the final output and the format of the entire GTA structure. This hybrid approach achieves both faster convergence than pure RL and higher performance ceiling than pure SFT. To mitigate gradient conflicts between the two training signals, we employ loss masking and gradient constraints. Empirical results on four text classification benchmarks demonstrate that GTA substantially accelerates convergence while outperforming both standalone SFT and RL baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Motivated by this principle, we introduce EyeRobot, a robotic system with gaze behavior that emerges from the need to complete real-world tasks. We develop a mechanical eyeball that can freely rotate to observe its surroundings and train a gaze policy to control it using reinforcement learning. We accomplish this by first collecting teleoperated demonstrations paired with a 360 camera. This data is imported into a simulation environment that supports rendering arbitrary eyeball viewpoints, allowing episode rollouts of eye gaze on top of robot demonstrations. We then introduce a BC-RL loop to train the hand and eye jointly: the hand (BC) agent is trained from rendered eye observations, and the eye (RL) agent is rewarded when the hand produces correct action predictions. In this way, hand-eye coordination emerges as the eye looks towards regions which allow the hand to complete the task. EyeRobot implements a foveal-inspired policy architecture allowing high resolution with a small compute budget, which we find also leads to the emergence of more stable fixation as well as improved ability to track objects and ignore distractors. We evaluate EyeRobot on five panoramic workspace manipulation tasks requiring manipulation in an arc surrounding the robot arm. Our experiments suggest EyeRobot exhibits hand-eye coordination behaviors which effectively facilitate manipulation over large workspaces with a single camera.

Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/HSH55/RISE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compositional shield synthesis for safe reinforcement learning in partial observability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12085v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents controlled by the output of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms often transition to unsafe states, particularly in uncertain and partially observable environments. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural setting for studying such scenarios with limited sensing. Shields filter undesirable actions to ensure safe RL by preserving safety requirements in the agents' policy. However, synthesizing holistic shields is computationally expensive in complex deployment scenarios. We propose the compositional synthesis of shields by modeling safety requirements by parts, thereby improving scalability. In particular, problem formulations in the form of POMDPs using RL algorithms illustrate that an RL agent equipped with the resulting compositional shielding, beyond being safe, converges to higher values of expected reward. By using subproblem formulations, we preserve and improve the ability of shielded agents to require fewer training episodes than unshielded agents, especially in sparse-reward settings. Concretely, we find that compositional shield synthesis allows an RL agent to remain safe in environments two orders of magnitude larger than other state-of-the-art model-based approaches.</p></details> |  |

A compact reward routing mechanism dynamically activates gait-specific objectives based on a one-hot gait ID, mitigating reward interference and supporting stable multi-gait learning. Human-inspired reward terms promote biomechanically natural motions, such as straight-knee stance and coordinated arm-leg swing, without requiring motion capture data. A structured curriculum progressively introduces gait complexity and expands command space over multiple phases. In simulation, the policy successfully achieves robust standing, walking, running, and gait transitions. On the real Unitree G1 humanoid, we validate standing, walking, and walk-to-stand transitions, demonstrating stable and coordinated locomotion. This work provides a scalable, reference-free solution toward versatile and naturalistic humanoid control across diverse modes and environments.</p></details> |  |

During back-testing on AAPL stock from January 2024 to May 2025, Hi-DARTS yielded a cumulative return of 25.17% with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.75. This performance surpasses standard benchmarks, including a passive buy-and-hold strategy on AAPL (12.19% return) and the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (20.01% return).

Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it. Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalizing Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Closed-Form Reward Centroids](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12010v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints. Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy. In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the "average" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learned Controllers for Agile Quadrotors in Pursuit-Evasion Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02849v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of agile 1v1 quadrotor pursuit-evasion, where a pursuer and an evader learn to outmaneuver each other through reinforcement learning (RL). Such settings face two major challenges: non-stationarity, since each agent's evolving policy alters the environment dynamics and destabilizes training, and catastrophic forgetting, where a policy overfits to the current adversary and loses effectiveness against previously encountered strategies. To tackle these issues, we propose an Asynchronous Multi-Stage Population-Based (AMSPB) algorithm. At each stage, the pursuer and evader are trained asynchronously against a frozen pool of opponents sampled from a growing population of past and current policies, stabilizing training and ensuring exposure to diverse behaviors. Within this framework, we train neural network controllers that output either velocity commands or body rates with collective thrust. Experiments in a high-fidelity simulator show that: (i) AMSPB-trained RL policies outperform RL and geometric baselines; (ii) body-rate-and-thrust controllers achieve more agile flight than velocity-based controllers, leading to better pursuit-evasion performance; (iii) AMSPB yields stable, monotonic gains across stages; and (iv) trained policies in one arena size generalize fairly well to other sizes without retraining.</p></details> | Under review |

However, there is a lack of flexible framework to implement RL across various control problems in building energy management. To address this gap, we propose BuildingGym, an open-source tool designed as a research-friendly and flexible framework for training RL control strategies for common challenges in building energy management. BuildingGym integrates EnergyPlus as its core simulator, making it suitable for both system-level and room-level control. Additionally, BuildingGym is able to accept external signals as control inputs instead of taking the building as a stand-alone entity. This feature makes BuildingGym applicable for more flexible environments, e.g. smart grid and EVs community. The tool provides several built-in RL algorithms for control strategy training, simplifying the process for building managers to obtain optimal control strategies. Users can achieve this by following a few straightforward steps to configure BuildingGym for optimization control for common problems in the building energy management field. Moreover, AI specialists can easily implement and test state-of-the-art control algorithms within the platform. BuildingGym bridges the gap between building managers and AI specialists by allowing for the easy configuration and replacement of RL algorithms, simulators, and control environments or problems. With BuildingGym, we efficiently set up training tasks for cooling load management, targeting both constant and dynamic cooling load management. The built-in algorithms demonstrated strong performance across both tasks, highlighting the effectiveness of BuildingGym in optimizing cooling strategies.</p></details> |  |

Current alignment techniques, such as supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning from human feedback, remain fragile and can be bypassed by carefully crafted adversarial prompts. Unfortunately, such attacks rely on trial and error, lack generalizability across models, and are constrained by scalability and reliability. This paper presents NeuroStrike, a novel and generalizable attack framework that exploits a fundamental vulnerability introduced by alignment techniques: the reliance on sparse, specialized safety neurons responsible for detecting and suppressing harmful inputs. We apply NeuroStrike to both white-box and black-box settings: In the white-box setting, NeuroStrike identifies safety neurons through feedforward activation analysis and prunes them during inference to disable safety mechanisms. In the black-box setting, we propose the first LLM profiling attack, which leverages safety neuron transferability by training adversarial prompt generators on open-weight surrogate models and then deploying them against black-box and proprietary targets. We evaluate NeuroStrike on over 20 open-weight LLMs from major LLM developers. By removing less than 0.6% of neurons in targeted layers, NeuroStrike achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 76.9% using only vanilla malicious prompts. Moreover, Neurostrike generalizes to four multimodal LLMs with 100% ASR on unsafe image inputs. Safety neurons transfer effectively across architectures, raising ASR to 78.5% on 11 fine-tuned models and 77.7% on five distilled models. The black-box LLM profiling attack achieves an average ASR of 63.7% across five black-box models, including the Google Gemini family.</p></details> |  |

While robust detection frameworks and diverse, large-scale datasets are essential to mitigate these risks, existing academic efforts remain limited in scope: current datasets lack the diversity, scale, and realism required for social media contexts, while detection methods struggle with generalization to unseen generative technologies. To bridge this gap, we introduce So-Fake-Set, a comprehensive social media-oriented dataset with over 2 million high-quality images, diverse generative sources, and photorealistic imagery synthesized using 35 state-of-the-art generative models. To rigorously evaluate cross-domain robustness, we establish a novel and large-scale (100K) out-of-domain benchmark (So-Fake-OOD) featuring synthetic imagery from commercial models explicitly excluded from the training distribution, creating a realistic testbed for evaluating real-world performance. Leveraging these resources, we present So-Fake-R1, an advanced vision-language framework that employs reinforcement learning for highly accurate forgery detection, precise localization, and explainable inference through interpretable visual rationales. Extensive experiments show that So-Fake-R1 outperforms the second-best method, with a 1.3% gain in detection accuracy and a 4.5% increase in localization IoU. By integrating a scalable dataset, a challenging OOD benchmark, and an advanced detection framework, this work establishes a new foundation for social media-centric forgery detection research. The code, models, and datasets will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |

We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any combination of these attributes. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 48 VRP variants show RouteFinder outperforms recent state-of-the-art learning methods.

We develop a game-theoretic model to enhance communication security, radar sensing accuracy, and power efficiency. The interaction between the legitimate network and the mobile adversary is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game (NSG), where the M-UAV acts as the leader and strategically adjusts its trajectory to improve its eavesdropping ability while conserving power and avoiding obstacles. In response, the legitimate network, acting as the follower, dynamically allocates resources to minimize network power usage while ensuring required secrecy rates and sensing performance. To address this challenging problem, we propose a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA) method for network resource optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for adaptive M-UAV trajectory planning through sequential interactions and learning. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in addressing security challenges of dynamic ISAC systems in 6G, i.e., achieving a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust performance while mitigating the adversary's ability to intercept network signals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, Special Issue on Recent Advances in Integrated Sensing and Communications</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning capabilities, their high computational cost and limited adaptability hinder real-time deployment on edge devices. We present SmallPlan - a novel framework leveraging LLMs as teacher models to train lightweight Small Language Models (SLMs) for high-level path planning tasks. In SmallPlan, the SLMs provide optimal action sequences to navigate across scene graphs that compactly represent full-scaled 3D scenes. The SLMs are trained in a simulation-powered, interleaved manner with LLM-guided supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). This strategy not only enables SLMs to successfully complete navigation tasks but also makes them aware of important factors like distance travel, providing more efficient path planning. Through experiments, we demonstrate that the fine-tuned SLMs perform competitively with larger models like GPT-4o on sequential path planning, without suffering from hallucination and overfitting. SmallPlan is resource-efficient, making it well-suited for edge-device deployment and advancing practical autonomous robotics.

However, these two capabilities are often developed in isolation, and existing efforts to unify them remain narrow in scope -- typically limited to open-domain QA with fixed retrieval settings and task-specific constraints. This lack of integration constrains generalization and limits the applicability of RAG-RL methods to broader domains. To bridge this gap, we propose UR2 (Unified RAG and Reasoning), a general framework that unifies retrieval and reasoning through reinforcement learning. UR2 introduces two key contributions: a difficulty-aware curriculum training that selectively invokes retrieval only for challenging problems, and a hybrid knowledge access strategy combining domain-specific offline corpora with LLM-generated summaries. These components are designed to enable dynamic coordination between retrieval and reasoning, improving adaptability across a diverse range of tasks. Experiments across open-domain QA, MMLU-Pro, medical, and mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that UR$^2$ (built on Qwen-2.5-3/7B and LLaMA-3.1-8B) significantly outperforms existing RAG and RL methods, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4o-mini and GPT-4.1-mini on several benchmarks. We have released all code, models, and data at https://github.com/Tsinghua-dhy/UR2.</p></details> |  |

Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) but faces challenges in heterogeneous distributed environments due to its tightly-coupled sampling-learning alternation. We propose HeteroRL, an asynchronous RL architecture that decouples rollout sampling from parameter learning, enabling robust deployment across geographically distributed nodes under network delays. We identify that latency-induced KL divergence causes importance sampling failure due to high variance. To address this, we propose Group Expectation Policy Optimization (GEPO), which reduces importance weight variance through a refined sampling mechanism. Theoretically, GEPO achieves exponential variance reduction. Experiments show it maintains superior stability over methods like GRPO, with less than 3% performance degradation under 1800-second delays, demonstrating strong potential for decentralized RL in heterogeneous networks.</p></details> |  |

Sometimes human feedback is systematically wrong on certain types of inputs, like a broken compass that points the wrong way in specific regions. We prove that when feedback is biased on a fraction alpha of contexts with bias strength epsilon, any learning algorithm needs exponentially many samples exp(n*alpha*epsilon^2) to distinguish between two possible "true" reward functions that differ only on these problematic contexts. However, if you can identify where feedback is unreliable (a "calibration oracle"), you can focus your limited questions there and overcome the exponential barrier with just O(1/(alpha*epsilon^2)) queries. This quantifies why alignment is hard: rare edge cases with subtly biased feedback create an exponentially hard learning problem unless you know where to look. The gap between what we optimize (proxy from human feedback) and what we want (true objective) is fundamentally limited by how common the problematic contexts are (alpha), how wrong the feedback is there (epsilon), and how much the true objectives disagree there (gamma). Murphy's Law for AI alignment: the gap always wins unless you actively route around misspecification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Provi...</summary><p>Provides a formal impossibility theorem (Murphys Gap) and welcomes collaboration on large-scale experiments and benchmark design</p></details> |

Built on the Qwen2.5 base model, our system shows that smaller models can compete at the highest levels by combining advanced post-training and test-time computation techniques. The approach is based on six key technical pillars: Long Chain-of-thought Supervised Finetuning, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), Agentic planning prior to reasoning, Test-time Scaling, Speculative Decoding, and Inference-optimized Hardware, all using publicly available open-source datasets. K2-Think excels in mathematical reasoning, achieving state-of-the-art scores on public benchmarks for open-source models, while also performing strongly in other areas such as Code and Science.

| **[UI-S1: Advancing GUI Automation via Semi-online Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11543v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated remarkable progress in automating complex user interface interactions through reinforcement learning. However, current approaches face a fundamental dilemma: offline RL enables stable training on pre-collected trajectories, but struggles with multi-step task execution for lack of trajectory-level reward signals; online RL captures these signals through environment interaction, but suffers from sparse rewards and prohibitive deployment costs. To address it, we present Semi-online Reinforcement Learning, a novel paradigm that simulates online RL on offline trajectories. During each rollout process, we preserve the original model output within the multi-turn dialogue, where a Patch Module adaptively recovers the divergence between rollout and expert trajectories. To capture long-term training signals, Semi-online RL introduces discounted future returns into the reward computation and optimizes the policy with weighted step-level and episode-level advantages. We further introduce Semi-Online Performance (SOP), a metric that aligns better with true online performance, serving as a practical and effective proxy for real-world evaluation. Experiments show that ours Semi-online RL achieves SOTA performance among 7B models across four dynamic benchmarks, with significant gains over the base model (e.g., +12.0% on AndroidWorld, +23.8% on AITW), demonstrating significant progress in bridging the gap between offline training efficiency and online multi-turn reasoning.

| **[Self-Evolving Curriculum for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14970v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly enhancing their reasoning abilities in domains such as mathematics and code generation. A crucial factor influencing RL fine-tuning success is the training curriculum: the order in which training problems are presented. While random curricula serve as common baselines, they remain suboptimal; manually designed curricula often rely heavily on heuristics, and online filtering methods can be computationally prohibitive. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Evolving Curriculum (SEC), an automatic curriculum learning method that learns a curriculum policy concurrently with the RL fine-tuning process. Our approach formulates curriculum selection as a non-stationary Multi-Armed Bandit problem, treating each problem category (e.g., difficulty level or problem type) as an individual arm. We leverage the absolute advantage from policy gradient methods as a proxy measure for immediate learning gain. At each training step, the curriculum policy selects categories to maximize this reward signal and is updated using the TD(0) method. Across three distinct reasoning domains: planning, inductive reasoning, and mathematics, our experiments demonstrate that SEC significantly improves models' reasoning capabilities, enabling better generalization to harder, out-of-distribution test problems. Additionally, our approach achieves better skill balance when fine-tuning simultaneously on multiple reasoning domains. These findings highlight SEC as a promising strategy for RL fine-tuning of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

OneRec reformulates recommendation as an autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning relying solely on reward models. To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions: Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to better align with user preferences using real-world feedback. Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness, improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the development of end-to-end recommender systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Infinite-Dimensional Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15737v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interest in reinforcement learning (RL) for large-scale systems, comprising extensive populations of intelligent agents interacting with heterogeneous environments, has surged significantly across diverse scientific domains in recent years. However, the large-scale nature of these systems often leads to high computational costs or reduced performance for most state-of-the-art RL techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel RL architecture and derive effective algorithms to learn optimal policies for arbitrarily large systems of agents. In our formulation, we model such systems as parameterized control systems defined on an infinite-dimensional function space. We then develop a moment kernel transform that maps the parameterized system and the value function into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This transformation generates a sequence of finite-dimensional moment representations for the RL problem, organized into a filtrated structure. Leveraging this RL filtration, we develop a hierarchical algorithm for learning optimal policies for the infinite-dimensional parameterized system. To enhance the algorithm's efficiency, we exploit early stopping at each hierarchy, demonstrating the fast convergence property of the algorithm through the construction of a convergent spectral sequence. The performance and efficiency of the proposed algorithm are validated using practical examples in engineering and quantum systems.</p></details> |  |

Existing underwater diver communication methods face hurdles due to inherent disadvantages and complex underwater environments. To address this issue, we propose a scheme that utilizes maritime unmanned systems to assist divers with reliable and high-speed communication. Multiple AUVs are equipped with optical and acoustic multimodal communication devices as relay nodes, providing adaptive communication services based on changes in the diver's activity area. By using a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approach to control the cooperative movement of AUVs, high-speed and reliable data transmission between divers can be achieved. At the same time, utilizing the advantages of on-demand deployment and wide coverage of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) as surface relay nodes to coordinate and forward information from AUVs, and controlling AUVs to adaptively select relay USV nodes for data transmission, high-quality communication between divers and surface platform can be achieved. Through simulation verification, the proposed scheme can effectively achieve reliable and high-speed communication for divers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Topology-Aware and Highly Generalizable Deep Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Retrieval in Multi-Deep Storage Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14787v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern industrial and logistics environments, the rapid expansion of fast delivery services has heightened the demand for storage systems that combine high efficiency with increased density. Multi-deep autonomous vehicle storage and retrieval systems (AVS/RS) present a viable solution for achieving greater storage density. However, these systems encounter significant challenges during retrieval operations due to lane blockages. A conventional approach to mitigate this issue involves storing items with homogeneous characteristics in a single lane, but this strategy restricts the flexibility and adaptability of multi-deep storage systems. In this study, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based framework to address the retrieval problem in multi-deep storage systems with heterogeneous item configurations. Each item is associated with a specific due date, and the objective is to minimize total tardiness. To effectively capture the system's topology, we introduce a graph-based state representation that integrates both item attributes and the local topological structure of the multi-deep warehouse. To process this representation, we design a novel neural network architecture that combines a Graph Neural Network (GNN) with a Transformer model. The GNN encodes topological and item-specific information into embeddings for all directly accessible items, while the Transformer maps these embeddings into global priority assignments. The Transformer's strong generalization capability further allows our approach to be applied to storage systems with diverse layouts. Extensive numerical experiments, including comparisons with heuristic methods, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed neural network architecture and the effectiveness of the trained agent in optimizing retrieval tardiness.</p></details> |  |

| **[Exploring Efficient Open-Vocabulary Segmentation in the Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12040v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS) domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench}) based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

However, it fails when applied to medical image segmentation (MIS) and infrared small target segmentation (IRSTS) due to limited data and limited fitting capacity. In this paper, we propose a new type of dynamic convolution called dynamic parameter convolution (DPConv) which shows superior fitting capacity, and it can efficiently leverage features from deep layers of encoder in reconstruction tasks to generate DPConv kernels that adapt to input variations.Moreover, we observe that DPConv, built upon deep features derived from reconstruction tasks, significantly enhances downstream segmentation performance. We refer to the segmentation network integrated with DPConv generated from reconstruction network as the siamese reconstruction-segmentation network (SRS). We conduct extensive experiments on seven datasets including five medical datasets and two infrared datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can show superior performance over several recently proposed methods. Furthermore, the zero-shot segmentation under unseen modality demonstrates the generalization of DPConv.

Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figure |
| **[Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10784v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD) and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from unqueried ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

However, most of these approaches rely on optimizing the U-Net structure or adding new functional modules, which overlooks the complementation and fusion of coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic information. To address these issues, we propose a 2D medical image segmentation framework called Progressive Learning Network (PL-Net), which comprises Internal Progressive Learning (IPL) and External Progressive Learning (EPL). PL-Net offers the following advantages: (1) IPL divides feature extraction into two steps, allowing for the mixing of different size receptive fields and capturing semantic information from coarse to fine granularity without introducing additional parameters; (2) EPL divides the training process into two stages to optimize parameters and facilitate the fusion of coarse-grained information in the first stage and fine-grained information in the second stage. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our proposed method on five medical image segmentation datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that PL-Net achieves competitive segmentation performance. It is worth noting that PL-Net does not introduce any additional learnable parameters compared to other U-Net variants.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns regarding the reliability of segmentation regions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration to accuracy. To address this, we introduce DEviS, an easily implementable foundational model that seamlessly integrates into various medical image segmentation networks. DEviS not only enhances the calibration and robustness of baseline segmentation accuracy but also provides high-efficiency uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions. By leveraging subjective logic theory, we explicitly model probability and uncertainty for medical image segmentation. Here, the Dirichlet distribution parameterizes the distribution of probabilities for different classes of the segmentation results. To generate calibrated predictions and uncertainty, we develop a trainable calibrated uncertainty penalty. Furthermore, DEviS incorporates an uncertainty-aware filtering module, which designs the metric of uncertainty-calibrated error to filter out-of-distribution data. We conducted validation studies on publicly available datasets, including ISIC2018, KiTS2021, LiTS2017, and BraTS2019, to assess the accuracy and robustness of different backbone segmentation models enhanced by DEviS, as well as the efficiency and reliability of uncertainty estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics</p></details> |

Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87% across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical application.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be made publicly available.

| **[CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.</p></details> | BIBM |
| **[Vision-Language Semantic Aggregation Leveraging Foundation Model for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08570v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain. Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence. The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |

Addressing the differences in frequency band sensitivity between CNNs and the human visual system (mid-frequency sensitivity with low-frequency sensitivity surpassing high-frequency), we experimentally quantified the CNN contrast sensitivity function and proposed a wavelet adaptive spectrum fusion (WASF) method inspired by biological vision mechanisms to balance cross-frequency image features. Furthermore, we designed a perception frequency block (PFB) that integrates WASF to enhance frequency-domain feature extraction. Based on this, we developed the FE-UNet model, which employs a SAM2 backbone network and incorporates fine-tuned Hiera-Large modules to ensure segmentation accuracy while improving generalization capability.

To address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%, BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image segmentation.

First, acquiring complete pixel-level segmentation labels for medical images is time-consuming and requires domain expertise. Second, typical segmentation pipelines cannot detect out-of-distribution (OOD) pixels, leaving them prone to spurious outputs during deployment. In this work, we propose a novel segmentation approach which broadly falls within the positive-unlabelled (PU) learning paradigm and exploits tools from OOD detection techniques. Our framework learns only from sparsely annotated pixels from multiple positive-only classes and does not use any annotation for the background class. These multi-class positive annotations naturally fall within the in-distribution (ID) set. Unlabelled pixels may contain positive classes but also negative ones, including what is typically referred to as \emph{background} in standard segmentation formulations. Here, we forgo the need for background annotation and consider these together with any other unseen classes as part of the OOD set. Our framework can integrate, at a pixel-level, any OOD detection approaches designed for classification tasks. To address the lack of existing OOD datasets and established evaluation metric for medical image segmentation, we propose a cross-validation strategy that treats held-out labelled classes as OOD. Extensive experiments on both multi-class hyperspectral and RGB surgical imaging datasets demonstrate the robustness and generalisation capability of our proposed framework.</p></details> |  |

While convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks, their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep, computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github repository: https://github.com/mkianih/Barlow-Swin.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM$^{*}$: Task-Adaptive SAM with Physics-Guided Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07047v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability. However, foundational models often present a considerable number of non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization, limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$, that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features.</p></details> | 19 pages, 8 figures |
| **[In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy: Efficient Estimation of Segmentation Quality without Ground-Truth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04522v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the quality of automatic image segmentation is crucial in clinical practice, but often very challenging due to the limited availability of ground truth annotations. In this paper, we introduce In-Context Reverse Classification Accuracy (In-Context RCA), a novel framework for automatically estimating segmentation quality in the absence of ground-truth annotations. By leveraging recent in-context learning segmentation models and incorporating retrieval-augmentation techniques to select the most relevant reference images, our approach enables efficient quality estimation with minimal reference data. Validated across diverse medical imaging modalities, our method demonstrates robust performance and computational efficiency, offering a promising solution for automated quality control in clinical workflows, where fast and reliable segmentation assessment is essential.

| **[Text4Seg++: Advancing Image Segmentation via Generative Language Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06321v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding (R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks. To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness, scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the MLLM framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our conference paper arXiv:2410.09855</p></details> |
| **[MedSeqFT: Sequential Fine-tuning Foundation Models for 3D Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06096v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies, however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore, evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective, knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving clinical tasks. Code will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DiffOSeg: Omni Medical Image Segmentation via Multi-Expert Collaboration Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13087v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Annotation variability remains a substantial challenge in medical image segmentation, stemming from ambiguous imaging boundaries and diverse clinical expertise. Traditional deep learning methods producing single deterministic segmentation predictions often fail to capture these annotator biases. Although recent studies have explored multi-rater segmentation, existing methods typically focus on a single perspective -- either generating a probabilistic ``gold standard'' consensus or preserving expert-specific preferences -- thus struggling to provide a more omni view. In this study, we propose DiffOSeg, a two-stage diffusion-based framework, which aims to simultaneously achieve both consensus-driven (combining all experts' opinions) and preference-driven (reflecting experts' individual assessments) segmentation. Stage I establishes population consensus through a probabilistic consensus strategy, while Stage II captures expert-specific preference via adaptive prompts. Demonstrated on two public datasets (LIDC-IDRI and NPC-170), our model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across all evaluated metrics.

| **[Dual Interaction Network with Cross-Image Attention for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05953v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and qualitatively.

| **[A Probabilistic Segment Anything Model for Ambiguity-Aware Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05809v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations. The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference, enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement, outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tbwa233/Probabilistic-SAM/.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Hessian-Based Lightweight Neural Network HessNet for State-of-the-Art Brain Vessel Segmentation on a Minimal Training Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15660v3)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is essential for successful surgical procedures, such as aneurysm repair or bypass surgery. Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations. To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases. The dataset is available at https://git.scinalytics.com/terilat/VesselDatasetPartly.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

A major contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former, the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention. Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package, available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.</p></details> |  |

For intelligent transportation systems (ITS), where accurate scene understanding is critical for safety and efficiency, this new paradigm offers unprecedented capabilities. This survey systematically reviews the emerging field of LLM-augmented image segmentation, focusing on its applications, challenges, and future directions within ITS. We provide a taxonomy of current approaches based on their prompting mechanisms and core architectures, and we highlight how these innovations can enhance road scene understanding for autonomous driving, traffic monitoring, and infrastructure maintenance. Finally, we identify key challenges, including real-time performance and safety-critical reliability, and outline a perspective centered on explainable, human-centric AI as a prerequisite for the successful deployment of this technology in next-generation transportation systems.</p></details> |  |

It comprises approximately 110,000 X-ray images of 10 knee implant pair combinations (2 femur and 5 tibia implants) captured during 1,600 trials, incorporating poses associated with daily activities such as level gait and ramp descent.

| **[Depthwise-Dilated Convolutional Adapters for Medical Object Tracking and Segmentation Using the Segment Anything Model 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14613v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL 2025) short paper</p></details> |

This paper addresses the issue from the perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU), while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers before dangerous situations escalate.

Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/HSH55/RISE.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3% identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |

While most existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers, originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules, SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new benchmark in the field.

This paper introduces an efficient end-to-end robotic system for autonomous shelf stocking and fronting, integrating commercially available hardware with a scalable algorithmic architecture. A major contribution of this work is the system integration of off-the-shelf hardware and ROS2-based perception, planning, and control into a single deployable platform for retail environments. Our solution leverages Behavior Trees (BTs) for task planning, fine-tuned vision models for object detection, and a two-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for precise shelf navigation using ArUco markers. Laboratory experiments replicating realistic supermarket conditions demonstrate reliable performance, achieving over 98% success in pick-and-place operations across a total of more than 700 stocking events. However, our comparative benchmarks indicate that the performance and cost-effectiveness of current autonomous systems remain inferior to that of human workers, which we use to highlight key improvement areas and quantify the progress still required before widespread commercial deployment can realistically be achieved.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for publication at IEEE ICRA 2026</p></details> |

These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we present a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks.

| **[First RAG, Second SEG: A Training-Free Paradigm for Camouflaged Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15313v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds. Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code: https://github.com/Lwt-diamond/RAG-SEG.}</p></details> |  |
| **[IRDFusion: Iterative Relation-Map Difference guided Feature Fusion for Multispectral Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09085v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance. To address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while suppressing shared background interference. Our solution centers on two novel, specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power. Inspired by feedback differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion. IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing feature noise, leading to significant performance gains. In extensive experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness. Code will be available at https://github.com/61s61min/IRDFusion.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages,6 figures, submitted on 3 Sep,2025</p></details> |

However, most existing studies overlook the semantic differences among textual prompts of different targets as well as fine-grained frequency features. In this work, we propose a novel Semantic and Frequency Guided Network (SFGNet), which incorporates semantic prompts and frequency-domain features to capture camouflaged objects and improve boundary perception. We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries. In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on three COD benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks such as object detection and scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 6th International Conference on Computer Vision and Data Mining (ICCVDM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Goal-Oriented Approach for Active Object Detection with Exploration-Exploitation Balance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11467v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Active object detection, which aims to identify objects of interest through controlled camera movements, plays a pivotal role in real-world visual perception for autonomous robotic applications, such as manufacturing tasks (e.g., assembly operations) performed in unknown environments. A dual control for exploration and exploitation (DCEE) algorithm is presented within goal-oriented control systems to achieve efficient active object detection, leveraging active learning by incorporating variance-based uncertainty estimation in the cost function. This novel method employs an exploration-exploitation balanced cost function to actively guide the selection of the next viewpoint. Specifically, active object detection is achieved through the development of a reward function that encodes knowledge about the confidence variation of objects as a function of viewpoint position within a given domain. By identifying the unknown parameters of this function, the system generates an optimal viewpoint planning strategy. DCEE integrates parameter estimation of the reward function and view planning, ensuring a balanced trade-off between the exploitation of learned knowledge and active exploration during the planning process. Moreover, it demonstrates remarkable adaptability across diverse scenarios, effectively handling LEGO brick detection at varying locations. Importantly, the algorithm maintains consistent configuration settings and a fixed number of parameters across various scenarios, underscoring its efficiency and robustness. To validate the proposed approach, extensive numerical studies, high-fidelity virtual simulations, and real-world experiments under various scenarios were conducted. The results confirm the effectiveness of DCEE in active object detection, showcasing superior performance compared to existing methods, including model predictive control (MPC) and entropy approaches.</p></details> | 12 pages, 14 figures |

However, most existing approaches depend on high-resolution images and complex networks to achieve top performance, hindering their deployment in practical scenarios. Moreover, current multi-sensor fusion approaches mainly focus on improving feature fusion while largely neglecting effective supervision strategies for those features. To address these issues, we propose DAOcc, a novel multi-modal occupancy prediction framework that leverages 3D object detection supervision to assist in achieving superior performance, while using a deployment-friendly image backbone and practical input resolution. In addition, we introduce a BEV View Range Extension strategy to mitigate performance degradation caused by lower image resolution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DAOcc achieves new state-of-the-art results on both the Occ3D-nuScenes and Occ3D-Waymo benchmarks, and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin using only a ResNet-50 backbone and 256*704 input resolution. With TensorRT optimization, DAOcc reaches 104.9 FPS while maintaining 54.2 mIoU on an NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU.

| **[What is the Visual Cognition Gap between Humans and Multimodal LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10424v2)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown great promise in language-guided perceptual tasks such as recognition, segmentation, and object detection. However, their effectiveness in addressing visual cognition problems that require high-level multi-image reasoning and visual working memory is not well-established. One such challenge is matrix reasoning - the cognitive ability to discern relationships among patterns in a set of images and extrapolate to predict subsequent patterns. This skill is crucial during the early neurodevelopmental stages of children. Inspired by the matrix reasoning tasks in Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC), we propose a new dataset MaRs-VQA to evaluate the visual cognition capability of MLLMs and compare their performance with existing human visual cognition studies. Based on the training data of MaRs-VQA, we also finetune a baseline model Qwen2-VCog with multi-stage cognition reasoning annotations. Our comparative experiments with different baselines reveal a gap between MLLMs and human intelligence, highlighting the visual cognitive limitations of current MLLMs. We believe that the public release of MaRs-VQA and the Qwen2-VCog baseline model will drive progress toward the next generation of MLLMs with human-like visual cognition abilities. MaRs-VQA is available at huggingface.co/datasets/IrohXu/VCog-Bench. The training code of Qwen2-VCog is available at github.com/IrohXu/Cognition-MLLM.</p></details> | COLM 2025 |
| **[AutoOEP -- A Multi-modal Framework for Online Exam Proctoring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10887v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The burgeoning of online education has created an urgent need for robust and scalable systems to ensure academic integrity during remote examinations. Traditional human proctoring is often not feasible at scale, while existing automated solutions can be intrusive or fail to detect a wide range of cheating behaviors. This paper introduces AutoOEP (Automated Online Exam Proctoring), a comprehensive, multi-modal framework that leverages computer vision and machine learning to provide effective, automated proctoring. The system utilizes a dual-camera setup to capture both a frontal view of the examinee and a side view of the workspace, minimizing blind spots. Our approach integrates several parallel analyses: the Face Module performs continuous identity verification using ArcFace, along with head pose estimation, gaze tracking, and mouth movement analysis to detect suspicious cues. Concurrently, the Hand Module employs a fine-tuned YOLOv11 model for detecting prohibited items (e.g., mobile phones, notes) and tracks hand proximity to these objects. Features from these modules are aggregated and fed into a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network that analyzes temporal patterns to calculate a real-time cheating probability score. We evaluate AutoOEP on a custom-collected dataset simulating diverse exam conditions. Our system achieves an accuracy of 90.7% in classifying suspicious activities. The object detection component obtains a mean Average Precision (mAP@.5) of 0.57 for prohibited items, and the entire framework processes video streams at approximately 2.4 frames per second without a GPU. The results demonstrate that AutoOEP is an effective and resource-efficient solution for automated proctoring, significantly reducing the need for human intervention and enhancing the integrity of online assessments.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

This paper presents a detector-agnostic post-processing framework that converts overlap-induced redundancy into group evidence[cite: 6]. Overlapping tiling first recovers low-confidence candidates[cite: 7]. A Spatial Gate (DBSCAN on box centroids) and a Semantic Gate (DBSCAN on ResNet-18 embeddings) then validates group evidence[cite: 7]. Validated groups receive controlled confidence reweighting before class-aware NMS fusion[cite: 8]. Experiments on VisDrone show a recall increase from 0.685 to 0.778 (+0.093) and a precision adjustment from 0.801 to 0.595, yielding F1=0.669[cite: 9]. Post-processing latency averages 0.095 s per image[cite: 10]. These results indicate recall-first, precision-trade-off behavior that benefits recall-sensitive applications such as far-field counting and monitoring[cite: 10]. Ablation confirms that tiling exposes missed objects, spatial clustering stabilizes geometry, semantic clustering enforces appearance coherence, and reweighting provides calibrated integration with the baseline[cite: 11]. The framework requires no retraining and integrates with modern detectors[cite: 12]. Future work will reduce semantic gating cost and extend the approach with temporal cues[cite: 13].</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional RGB-based detection methods often fail under such adverse conditions, motivating the need for more robust, modality-agnostic approaches. In this work, we present HiddenObject, a fusion framework that integrates RGB, thermal, and depth data using a Mamba-based fusion mechanism. Our method captures complementary signals across modalities, enabling enhanced detection of obscured or camouflaged targets. Specifically, the proposed approach identifies modality-specific features and fuses them in a unified representation that generalizes well across challenging scenarios. We validate HiddenObject across multiple benchmark datasets, demonstrating state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to existing methods. These results highlight the efficacy of our fusion design and expose key limitations in current unimodal and na\"ive fusion strategies. More broadly, our findings suggest that Mamba-based fusion architectures can significantly advance the field of multimodal object detection, especially under visually degraded or complex conditions.</p></details> | fix typos |

Our approach fuses visual and acoustic features in a unified object detector model relying on the Deformable DETR and Wav2Vec2 architectures, achieving strong performance under challenging environmental conditions. Our work leverage the existing Drone-vs-Bird dataset and the newly generated ARDrone dataset containing more than 7,500 synchronized images and audio segments. We show how the acoustic information is used to improve the performance of the Deformable DETR object detector on the real ARDrone dataset. We developed, trained and tested four different fusion configurations based on a gated mechanism, linear layer, MLP and cross attention. The Wav2Vec2 acoustic embeddings are fused with the multi resolution feature mappings of the Deformable DETR and enhance the object detection performance over all drones dimensions. The best performer is the gated fusion approach, which improves the mAP of the Deformable DETR object detector on our in-distribution and out-of-distribution ARDrone datasets by 11.1% to 15.3% for small drones across all IoU thresholds between 0.5 and 0.9. The mAP scores for medium and large drones are also enhanced, with overall gains across all drone sizes ranging from 3.27% to 5.84%.</p></details> | 11 pages, 11 figures |

The framework combines Faster R-CNN (utilizing a ResNet backbone) for precise localization with YOLO (employing a Darknet backbone) for global context, enabling mutual pseudo-label exchange that improves accuracy in scenes with occlusion and overlapping objects. To strengthen classification, it employs an ensemble of XGBoost, Random Forest, and SVM, utilizing diverse feature representations for higher robustness. Hyperparameters are optimized using a metaheuristic-driven algorithm, enhancing precision and efficiency across models. By minimizing reliance on manual labeling, the approach reduces annotation costs and adapts effectively to frequent product and layout changes common in retail. Experiments on the SKU-110k dataset demonstrate strong performance, highlighting the scalability and practicality of the proposed framework for real-world retail applications such as automated inventory tracking, product monitoring, and checkout systems.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, open-vocabulary object detectors, widely used in embodied robotic agents, fail to distinguish subclasses of glasses. This scientific gap poses an issue for robotic applications that suffer from accumulating errors between detection, planning, and action execution. This paper introduces a novel method for acquiring real-world data from RGB-D sensors that minimizes human effort. We propose an auto-labeling pipeline that generates labels for all the acquired frames based on the depth measurements. We provide a novel real-world glass object dataset GlassNICOLDataset that was collected on the Neuro-Inspired COLlaborator (NICOL), a humanoid robot platform. The dataset consists of 7850 images recorded from five different cameras. We show that our trained baseline model outperforms state-of-the-art open-vocabulary approaches.

This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

Traditional closed-set detectors degrade significantly under domain shifts and flight data corruption, posing risks to safety-critical applications. We propose a novel, model-agnostic open-set detection framework designed specifically for embedding-based detectors. The method explicitly handles unknown object rejection while maintaining robustness against corrupted flight data. It estimates semantic uncertainty via entropy modeling in the embedding space and incorporates spectral normalization and temperature scaling to enhance open-set discrimination. We validate our approach on the challenging AOT aerial benchmark and through extensive real-world flight tests. Comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate consistent improvements over baseline methods, achieving up to a 10\% relative AUROC gain compared to standard YOLO-based detectors. Additionally, we show that background rejection further strengthens robustness without compromising detection accuracy, making our solution particularly well-suited for reliable UAV perception in dynamic air-to-air environments.</p></details> |  |

While recent studies have shown that RAW images offer superior potential over RGB images, existing approaches either use RAW-RGB images with information loss or employ complex frameworks. To address these, we propose a lightweight and self-adaptive Image Signal Processing (ISP) plugin, Dark-ISP, which directly processes Bayer RAW images in dark environments, enabling seamless end-to-end training for object detection. Our key innovations are: (1) We deconstruct conventional ISP pipelines into sequential linear (sensor calibration) and nonlinear (tone mapping) sub-modules, recasting them as differentiable components optimized through task-driven losses. Each module is equipped with content-aware adaptability and physics-informed priors, enabling automatic RAW-to-RGB conversion aligned with detection objectives. (2) By exploiting the ISP pipeline's intrinsic cascade structure, we devise a Self-Boost mechanism that facilitates cooperation between sub-modules. Through extensive experiments on three RAW image datasets, we demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art RGB- and RAW-based detection approaches, achieving superior results with minimal parameters in challenging low-light environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, conference</p></details> |

Issues such as densely packed small objects, scale variations, and occlusion are commonplace. This paper introduces RT-DETR++, which enhances the encoder component of the RT-DETR model. Our improvements focus on two key aspects. First, we introduce a channel-gated attention-based upsampling/downsampling (AU/AD) mechanism. This dual-path system minimizes errors and preserves details during feature layer propagation. Second, we incorporate CSP-PAC during feature fusion. This technique employs parallel hollow convolutions to process local and contextual information within the same layer, facilitating the integration of multi-scale features. Evaluation demonstrates that our novel neck design achieves superior performance in detecting small and densely packed objects. The model maintains sufficient speed for real-time detection without increasing computational complexity. This study provides an effective approach for feature encoding design in real-time detection systems.</p></details> |  |

However, perception methods based on deep learning are extremely vulnerable to adversarial samples, resulting in security accidents. How to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world and evaluate object detection systems is a huge challenge. In this study, we propose a unified joint adversarial training framework for both 2D and 3D domains, which simultaneously optimizes texture maps in 2D image and 3D mesh spaces to better address intra-class diversity and real-world environmental variations. The framework includes a novel realistic enhanced adversarial module, with time-space and relighting mapping pipeline that adjusts illumination consistency between adversarial patches and target garments under varied viewpoints. Building upon this, we develop a realism enhancement mechanism that incorporates non-rigid deformation modeling and texture remapping to ensure alignment with the human body's non-rigid surfaces in 3D scenes. Extensive experiment results in digital and physical environments demonstrate that the adversarial textures generated by our method can effectively mislead the target detection model. Specifically, our method achieves an average attack success rate (ASR) of 70.13% on YOLOv12 in physical scenarios, significantly outperforming existing methods such as T-SEA (21.65%) and AdvTexture (19.70%). Moreover, the proposed method maintains stable ASR across multiple viewpoints and distances, with an average attack success rate exceeding 90% under both frontal and oblique views at a distance of 4 meters. This confirms the method's strong robustness and transferability under multi-angle attacks, varying lighting conditions, and real-world distances.

We sidestep this issue by directly fusing hidden states from Large Language Models (LLMs) into detectors-an avenue surprisingly under-explored. This paper presents a systematic method to enhance visual grounding by utilizing decoder layers of the LLM of an MLLM. We introduce a zero-initialized cross-attention adapter to enable efficient knowledge fusion from LLMs to object detectors, a new approach called LED (LLM Enhanced Open-Vocabulary Object Detection). We find that intermediate LLM layers already encode rich spatial semantics; adapting only the early layers yields most of the gain. With Swin-T as the vision encoder, Qwen2-0.5B + LED lifts GroundingDINO by 3.82 % on OmniLabel at just 8.7 % extra GFLOPs, and a larger vision backbone pushes the improvement to 6.22 %. Extensive ablations on adapter variants, LLM scales and fusion depths further corroborate our design.</p></details> |  |

However, UOD faces numerous challenges that compromise its performance. Over the years, various methods have been proposed to address these issues, but they often fail to fully capture the complexities of underwater environments. This review systematically categorizes UOD challenges into five key areas: Image quality degradation, target-related issues, data-related challenges, computational and processing constraints, and limitations in detection methodologies. To address these challenges, we analyze the progression from traditional image processing and object detection techniques to modern approaches. Additionally, we explore the potential of large vision-language models (LVLMs) in UOD, leveraging their multi-modal capabilities demonstrated in other domains. We also present case studies, including synthetic dataset generation using DALL-E 3 and fine-tuning Florence-2 LVLM for UOD. This review identifies three key insights: (i) Current UOD methods are insufficient to fully address challenges like image degradation and small object detection in dynamic underwater environments. (ii) Synthetic data generation using LVLMs shows potential for augmenting datasets but requires further refinement to ensure realism and applicability. (iii) LVLMs hold significant promise for UOD, but their real-time application remains under-explored, requiring further research on optimization techniques.</p></details> | 72 Pages, 11 Figures |

| **[Multi-animal tracking in Transition: Comparative Insights into Established and Emerging Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11873v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Seg2Track-SAM2: SAM2-based Multi-object Tracking and Segmentation for Zero-shot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11772v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

| **[Motion Estimation for Multi-Object Tracking using KalmanNet with Semantic-Independent Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11323v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT). It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters. The code is available at (https://github.com/SongJgit/filternet and https://github.com/SongJgit/TBDTracker).</p></details> |  |
| **[ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/lsying009/ISTASTrack.git.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[An HMM-based framework for identity-aware long-term multi-object tracking from sparse and uncertain identification: use case on long-term tracking in livestock](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09962v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes. Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted at CVPR animal workshop 2024, submitted to IJCV</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

| **[Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.</p></details> |  |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments. We hope this survey serves as a reference, facilitating the adoption of event-based vision across diverse applications.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[Hyperspectral Mamba for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08265v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral object tracking holds great promise due to the rich spectral information and fine-grained material distinctions in hyperspectral images, which are beneficial in challenging scenarios. While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking EfficientTAM on FMO datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06536v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depthwise-Dilated Convolutional Adapters for Medical Object Tracking and Segmentation Using the Segment Anything Model 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14613v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods.

| **[PKF: Probabilistic Data Association Kalman Filter for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06378v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we derive a new Kalman filter with probabilistic data association between measurements and states. We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA. Given offline detections, our algorithm tracks at 250+ fps on a single laptop CPU. Code is available at https://github.com/hwcao17/pkf.</p></details> |  |

In this study, a novel benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers. The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage.

| **[Learning a Neural Association Network for Self-supervised Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11514v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel framework to learn data association for multi-object tracking in a self-supervised manner. Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections.</p></details> | BMVC2025 poster |
| **[See No Evil: Adversarial Attacks Against Linguistic-Visual Association in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02028v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[ADVMEM: Adversarial Memory Initialization for Realistic Test-Time Adaptation via Tracklet-Based Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02182v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel tracklet-based dataset for benchmarking test-time adaptation (TTA) methods. The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[NOOUGAT: Towards Unified Online and Offline Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02111v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The long-standing division between \textit{online} and \textit{offline} Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has led to fragmented solutions that fail to address the flexible temporal requirements of real-world deployment scenarios. Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeatureSORT: Essential Features for Effective Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04249v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce FeatureSORT, a simple yet effective online multiple object tracker that reinforces the DeepSORT baseline with a redesigned detector and additional feature cues. In contrast to conventional detectors that only provide bounding boxes, our modified YOLOX architecture is extended to output multiple appearance attributes, including clothing color, clothing style, and motion direction, alongside the bounding boxes. These feature cues, together with a ReID network, form complementary embeddings that substantially improve association accuracy. Furthermore, we incorporate stronger post-processing strategies, such as global linking and Gaussian Smoothing Process interpolation, to handle missing associations and detections. During online tracking, we define a measurement-to-track distance function that jointly considers IoU, direction, color, style, and ReID similarity. This design enables FeatureSORT to maintain consistent identities through longer occlusions while reducing identity switches. Extensive experiments on standard MOT benchmarks demonstrate that FeatureSORT achieves state-of-the-art online performance, with MOTA scores of 79.7 on MOT16, 80.6 on MOT17, 77.9 on MOT20, and 92.2 on DanceTrack, underscoring the effectiveness of feature-enriched detection and modular post processing in advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training. In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be released on https://lolrudy.github.io/No3DTrackSG/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025, website: https://lolrudy.github.io/No3DTrackSG/</p></details> |

This paper presents algorithms and techniques for addressing these challenges using Lidar sensor data, emphasizing ensemble Kalman filter. The developed predictive collision avoidance algorithm employs the data provided by lidar sensors to track multiple objects and predict their velocities and future positions, enabling the AMR to navigate safely and effectively. A modification to the dynamic windowing approach is introduced to enhance the performance of the collision avoidance system. The overall system architecture encompasses object detection, multi-object tracking, and predictive collision avoidance control. The experimental results, obtained from both simulation and real-world data, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in various scenarios, which lays the foundation for future research on global planners, other controllers, and the integration of additional sensors. This thesis contributes to the ongoing development of safe and efficient autonomous systems in complex and dynamic environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[QuaDreamer: Controllable Panoramic Video Generation for Quadruped Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02512v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Panoramic cameras, capturing comprehensive 360-degree environmental data, are suitable for quadruped robots in surrounding perception and interaction with complex environments. However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Springer International Journal of Computer Vision</p></details> |

The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 28th International Conference on Information Fusion (FUSION)</p></details> |

We present Structured Masking for AR-based Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[KB-DMGen: Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic Pose Masking for Human Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20083v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in Human Image Generation (HIG) with various control signals such as pose priors. In HIG, both accurate human poses and coherent visual quality are crucial for image generation. However, most existing methods mainly focus on pose accuracy while neglecting overall image quality, often improving pose alignment at the cost of image quality. To address this, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB), implemented as a visual codebook, provides coarse, global guidance based on input text-related visual features, improving pose accuracy while maintaining image quality, while the Dynamic pose Mask (DM) offers fine-grained local control to enhance precise pose accuracy. By injecting KB and DM at different stages of the diffusion process, our framework enhances pose accuracy through both global and local control without compromising image quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of KB-DMGen, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset.

| **[Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models: A Theoretical Perspective on Security and Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12024v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.</p></details> | Camera ready version |

It is difficult for dental professionals to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements. Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however, susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental practice.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |

Recognizing this, we aim to generate images for poems and improve these images in a zero-shot setting, enabling audiences to modify images as per their requirements. To achieve this, we introduce a novel Weighted Prompt Manipulation (WPM) technique, which systematically modifies attention weights and text embeddings within diffusion models. By dynamically adjusting the importance of specific words, WPM enhances or suppresses their influence in the final generated image, leading to semantically richer and more contextually accurate visualizations. Our approach exploits diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) such as GPT in conjunction with existing poetry datasets, ensuring a comprehensive and structured methodology for improved image generation in the literary domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at integrating weighted prompt manipulation for enhancing imagery in poetic language.</p></details> |  |

However, current best practices in this field, based on GANs, have not yet reached the desired level of quality. As latent diffusion models make significant strides in image generation, we are prompted to evaluate ControlNet, a notable method for its dense control capabilities. Our investigation uncovered two primary issues with its results: the presence of weird sub-structures within large semantic areas and the misalignment of content with the semantic mask. Through empirical study, we pinpointed the cause of these problems as a mismatch between the noised training data distribution and the standard normal prior applied at the inference stage. To address this challenge, we developed specific noise priors for SIS, encompassing spatial, categorical, and a novel spatial-categorical joint prior for inference. This approach, which we have named SCP-Diff, has set new state-of-the-art results in SIS on Cityscapes, ADE20K and COCO-Stuff, yielding a FID as low as 10.53 on Cityscapes. The code and models can be accessed via the project page.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://air-discover.github.io/SCP-Diff/</p></details> |
| **[RealRAG: Retrieval-augmented Realistic Image Generation via Self-reflective Contrastive Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00848v3)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image generative models, e.g., Stable Diffusion V3 and Flux, have achieved notable progress. However, these models are strongly restricted to their limited knowledge, a.k.a., their own fixed parameters, that are trained with closed datasets. This leads to significant hallucinations or distortions when facing fine-grained and unseen novel real-world objects, e.g., the appearance of the Tesla Cybertruck. To this end, we present the first real-object-based retrieval-augmented generation framework (RealRAG), which augments fine-grained and unseen novel object generation by learning and retrieving real-world images to overcome the knowledge gaps of generative models. Specifically, to integrate missing memory for unseen novel object generation, we train a reflective retriever by self-reflective contrastive learning, which injects the generator's knowledge into the sef-reflective negatives, ensuring that the retrieved augmented images compensate for the model's missing knowledge. Furthermore, the real-object-based framework integrates fine-grained visual knowledge for the generative models, tackling the distortion problem and improving the realism for fine-grained object generation. Our Real-RAG is superior in its modular application to all types of state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models and also delivers remarkable performance boosts with all of them, such as a gain of 16.18% FID score with the auto-regressive model on the Stanford Car benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |
| **[SeeDiff: Off-the-Shelf Seeded Mask Generation from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19808v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entrusted with the goal of pixel-level object classification, the semantic segmentation networks entail the laborious preparation of pixel-level annotation masks. To obtain pixel-level annotation masks for a given class without human efforts, recent few works have proposed to generate pairs of images and annotation masks by employing image and text relationships modeled by text-to-image generative models, especially Stable Diffusion. However, these works do not fully exploit the capability of text-guided Diffusion models and thus require a pre-trained segmentation network, careful text prompt tuning, or the training of a segmentation network to generate final annotation masks. In this work, we take a closer look at attention mechanisms of Stable Diffusion, from which we draw connections with classical seeded segmentation approaches. In particular, we show that cross-attention alone provides very coarse object localization, which however can provide initial seeds. Then, akin to region expansion in seeded segmentation, we utilize the semantic-correspondence-modeling capability of self-attention to iteratively spread the attention to the whole class from the seeds using multi-scale self-attention maps. We also observe that a simple-text-guided synthetic image often has a uniform background, which is easier to find correspondences, compared to complex-structured objects. Thus, we further refine a mask using a more accurate background mask. Our proposed method, dubbed SeeDiff, generates high-quality masks off-the-shelf from Stable Diffusion, without additional training procedure, prompt tuning, or a pre-trained segmentation network.</p></details> | AAAI 2025 |
| **[STADI: Fine-Grained Step-Patch Diffusion Parallelism for Heterogeneous GPUs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04719v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The escalating adoption of diffusion models for applications such as image generation demands efficient parallel inference techniques to manage their substantial computational cost. However, existing diffusion parallelism inference schemes often underutilize resources in heterogeneous multi-GPU environments, where varying hardware capabilities or background tasks cause workload imbalance. This paper introduces Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Inference (STADI), a novel framework to accelerate diffusion model inference in such settings. At its core is a hybrid scheduler that orchestrates fine-grained parallelism across both temporal and spatial dimensions. Temporally, STADI introduces a novel computation-aware step allocator applied after warmup phases, using a least-common-multiple-minimizing quantization technique to reduce denoising steps on slower GPUs and execution synchronization. To further minimize GPU idle periods, STADI executes an elastic patch parallelism mechanism that allocates variably sized image patches to GPUs according to their computational capability, ensuring balanced workload distribution through a complementary spatial mechanism. Extensive experiments on both load-imbalanced and heterogeneous multi-GPU clusters validate STADI's efficacy, demonstrating improved load balancing and mitigation of performance bottlenecks. Compared to patch parallelism, a state-of-the-art diffusion inference framework, our method significantly reduces end-to-end inference latency by up to 45% and significantly improves resource utilization on heterogeneous GPUs.</p></details> |  |

This shortcoming is commonly attributed to the locality bias inherent in diffusion-based generation, which limits their ability to model long-range spatial dependencies. In this paper, we introduce $\textbf{STRICT}$, a benchmark designed to systematically stress-test the ability of diffusion models to render coherent and instruction-aligned text in images. Our benchmark evaluates models across multiple dimensions: (1) the maximum length of readable text that can be generated; (2) the correctness and legibility of the generated text, and (3) the ratio of not following instructions for generating text. We evaluate several state-of-the-art models, including proprietary and open-source variants, and reveal persistent limitations in long-range consistency and instruction-following capabilities. Our findings provide insights into architectural bottlenecks and motivate future research directions in multimodal generative modeling.

Despite this, these technical advancements have overlooked whether and how medical professionals would benefit from and use text-to-image generative AI (GenAI) in practice. By developing domain-specific GenAI without involving stakeholders, we risk the potential of building models that are either not useful or even more harmful than helpful. In this paper, we adopt a human-centered approach to responsible model development by involving stakeholders in evaluating and reflecting on the promises, risks, and challenges of a novel text-to-CT Scan GenAI model. Through exploratory model prompting activities, we uncover the perspectives of medical students, radiology trainees, and radiologists on the role that text-to-CT Scan GenAI can play across medical education, training, and practice. This human-centered approach additionally enabled us to surface technical challenges and domain-specific risks of generating synthetic medical images. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of medical text-to-image GenAI.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages of main content, Appendix attached after references, accepted to AAAI/ACM AIES 2025</p></details> |

While existing methods like concept sliders have made strides, they often falter when it comes to no-AIGC images, particularly images captured in real world settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce Beyond Sliders, an innovative framework that integrates GANs and diffusion models to facilitate sophisticated image manipulation across diverse image categories. Improved upon concept sliders, our method refines the image through fine grained guidance both textual and visual in an adversarial manner, leading to a marked enhancement in image quality and realism.

| **[Bayesian Unsupervised Disentanglement of Anatomy and Geometry for Deep Groupwise Image Registration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02141v3)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article presents a general Bayesian learning framework for multi-modal groupwise image registration. The method builds on probabilistic modelling of the image generative process, where the underlying common anatomy and geometric variations of the observed images are explicitly disentangled as latent variables. Therefore, groupwise image registration is achieved via hierarchical Bayesian inference. We propose a novel hierarchical variational auto-encoding architecture to realise the inference procedure of the latent variables, where the registration parameters can be explicitly estimated in a mathematically interpretable fashion. Remarkably, this new paradigm learns groupwise image registration in an unsupervised closed-loop self-reconstruction process, sparing the burden of designing complex image-based similarity measures. The computationally efficient disentangled network architecture is also inherently scalable and flexible, allowing for groupwise registration on large-scale image groups with variable sizes. Furthermore, the inferred structural representations from multi-modal images via disentanglement learning are capable of capturing the latent anatomy of the observations with visual semantics. Extensive experiments were conducted to validate the proposed framework, including four different datasets from cardiac, brain, and abdominal medical images. The results have demonstrated the superiority of our method over conventional similarity-based approaches in terms of accuracy, efficiency, scalability, and interpretability.</p></details> |  |

By design, TTI models always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate default images: images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. Studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for prompt engineering and TTI generation. We present the first investigation into default images on Midjourney. We describe an initial study in which we manually created input prompts triggering default images, and several ablation studies. Building on these, we conduct a computational analysis of about 750,000 images, revealing consistent default images across unrelated prompts. We also conduct an online user study investigating how default images may affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI generation, highlighting their practical relevance as well as challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |

To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and Gen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and style-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules. The framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA) module that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts into precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and (2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera tion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas. During the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g., realism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each spatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms. The architec ture supports lightweight integration and replacement of ex pert models, providing strong extensibility. Additionally, an interactive interface enables real-time spatial layout editing and per-region style selection from a portfolio of experts. Ex periments show that MEPG significantly outperforms base line models with the same backbone in both image quality and style diversity.</p></details> |  |

Compared to other human image analysis tasks, state-of-the-art large multimodal models (LMMs) and image generation models struggle to recognize and synthesize skin tones accurately. To address this, we introduce TrueSkin, a dataset with 7299 images systematically categorized into 6 classes, collected under diverse lighting conditions, camera angles, and capture settings. Using TrueSkin, we benchmark existing recognition and generation approaches, revealing substantial biases: LMMs tend to misclassify intermediate skin tones as lighter ones, whereas generative models struggle to accurately produce specified skin tones when influenced by inherent biases from unrelated attributes in the prompts, such as hairstyle or environmental context. We further demonstrate that training a recognition model on TrueSkin improves classification accuracy by more than 20\% compared to LMMs and conventional approaches, and fine-tuning with TrueSkin significantly improves skin tone fidelity in image generation models. Our findings highlight the need for comprehensive datasets like TrueSkin, which not only serves as a benchmark for evaluating existing models but also provides a valuable training resource to enhance fairness and accuracy in skin tone recognition and generation tasks.</p></details> |  |

Plug-and-play token reduction methods like ToMeSD and ToFu reduce FLOPs by merging redundant tokens in generated images but rely on GPU-inefficient operations (e.g., sorting, scattered writes), introducing overheads that negate theoretical speedups when paired with optimized attention implementations (e.g., FlashAttention). To bridge this gap, we propose Token Merge with Attention (ToMA), an off-the-shelf method that redesigns token reduction for GPU-aligned efficiency, with three key contributions: 1) a reformulation of token merge as a submodular optimization problem to select diverse tokens; 2) merge/unmerge as an attention-like linear transformation via GPU-friendly matrix operations; and 3) exploiting latent locality and sequential redundancy (pattern reuse) to minimize overhead. ToMA reduces SDXL/Flux generation latency by 24%/23%, respectively (with DINO $\Delta < 0.07$), outperforming prior methods. This work bridges the gap between theoretical and practical efficiency for transformers in diffusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pr...</summary><p>In proceedings of the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025).

This paper introduces Maestro, a novel self-evolving image generation system that enables T2I models to autonomously self-improve generated images through iterative evolution of prompts, using only an initial prompt. Maestro incorporates two key innovations: 1) self-critique, where specialized multimodal LLM (MLLM) agents act as 'critics' to identify weaknesses in generated images, correct for under-specification, and provide interpretable edit signals, which are then integrated by a 'verifier' agent while preserving user intent; and 2) self-evolution, utilizing MLLM-as-a-judge for head-to-head comparisons between iteratively generated images, eschewing problematic images, and evolving creative prompt candidates that align with user intents. Extensive experiments on complex T2I tasks using black-box models demonstrate that Maestro significantly improves image quality over initial prompts and state-of-the-art automated methods, with effectiveness scaling with more advanced MLLM components. This work presents a robust, interpretable, and effective pathway towards self-improving T2I generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables (22 pages, 9 figures and 3 tables including references and appendices)</p></details> |
| **[FairCoT: Enhancing Fairness in Text-to-Image Generation via Chain of Thought Reasoning with Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09070v4)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of text-to-image generative models, biases inherent in training datasets often propagate into generated content, posing significant ethical challenges, particularly in socially sensitive contexts. We introduce FairCoT, a novel framework that enhances fairness in text to image models through Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning within multimodal generative large language models. FairCoT employs iterative CoT refinement to systematically mitigate biases, and dynamically adjusts textual prompts in real time, ensuring diverse and equitable representation in generated images. By integrating iterative reasoning processes, FairCoT addresses the limitations of zero shot CoT in sensitive scenarios, balancing creativity with ethical responsibility. Experimental evaluations across popular text-to-image systems including DALLE and various Stable Diffusion variants, demonstrate that FairCoT significantly enhances fairness and diversity without sacrificing image quality or semantic fidelity. By combining robust reasoning, lightweight deployment, and extensibility to multiple models, FairCoT represents a promising step toward more socially responsible and transparent AI driven content generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |

Current diffusion models increase computational demand quadratically with resolution, causing 4K image generation delays over 100 seconds. To solve this, we explore the second generation upon the latent diffusion models, where the fixed latent generated by diffusion models is regarded as the content representation and we propose to decode arbitrary resolution images with a compact generated latent using a one-step generator. Thus, we present the \textbf{InfGen}, replacing the VAE decoder with the new generator, for generating images at any resolution from a fixed-size latent without retraining the diffusion models, which simplifies the process, reducing computational complexity and can be applied to any model using the same latent space. Experiments show InfGen is capable of improving many models into the arbitrary high-resolution era while cutting 4K image generation time to under 10 seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[MagicMirror: A Large-Scale Dataset and Benchmark for Fine-Grained Artifacts Assessment in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10260v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) generation has achieved remarkable progress in instruction following and aesthetics. However, a persistent challenge is the prevalence of physical artifacts, such as anatomical and structural flaws, which severely degrade perceptual quality and limit application. Given the diversity and complexity of these artifacts, a systematic and fine-grained evaluation framework is required, which is lacking in current benchmarks. To fill this gap, we introduce MagicMirror, a comprehensive framework for artifacts assessment. We first establish a detailed taxonomy of generated image artifacts. Guided by this taxonomy, we manually annotate MagicData340K, the first human-annotated large-scale dataset of 340K generated images with fine-grained artifact labels. Building on this dataset, we train MagicAssessor, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) that provides detailed assessments and corresponding labels. To overcome challenges like class imbalance and reward hacking, we design a novel data sampling strategy and a multi-level reward system for Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Finally, we leverage MagicAssessor to construct MagicBench, an automated benchmark for evaluating the image artifacts of current T2I models. Our evaluation with MagicBench reveals that despite their widespread adoption, even top-tier models like GPT-image-1 are consistently plagued by significant artifacts, highlighting artifact reduction as a critical frontier for future T2I development.

| **[Scalable Training for Vector-Quantized Networks with 100% Codebook Utilization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10140v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vector quantization (VQ) is a key component in discrete tokenizers for image generation, but its training is often unstable due to straight-through estimation bias, one-step-behind updates, and sparse codebook gradients, which lead to suboptimal reconstruction performance and low codebook usage. In this work, we analyze these fundamental challenges and provide a simple yet effective solution. To maintain high codebook usage in VQ networks (VQN) during learning annealing and codebook size expansion, we propose VQBridge, a robust, scalable, and efficient projector based on the map function method. VQBridge optimizes code vectors through a compress-process-recover pipeline, enabling stable and effective codebook training. By combining VQBridge with learning annealing, our VQN achieves full (100%) codebook usage across diverse codebook configurations, which we refer to as FVQ (FullVQ). Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that FVQ is effective, scalable, and generalizable: it attains 100% codebook usage even with a 262k-codebook, achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction performance, consistently improves with larger codebooks, higher vector channels, or longer training, and remains effective across different VQ variants. Moreover, when integrated with LlamaGen, FVQ significantly enhances image generation performance, surpassing visual autoregressive models (VAR) by 0.5 and diffusion models (DiT) by 0.2 rFID, highlighting the importance of high-quality tokenizers for strong autoregressive image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Generative Geospatial Diffusion Models Excel as Discriminative Geospatial Foundation Models?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07890v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-supervised learning (SSL) has revolutionized representation learning in Remote Sensing (RS), advancing Geospatial Foundation Models (GFMs) to leverage vast unlabeled satellite imagery for diverse downstream tasks. Currently, GFMs primarily employ objectives like contrastive learning or masked image modeling, owing to their proven success in learning transferable representations. However, generative diffusion models, which demonstrate the potential to capture multi-grained semantics essential for RS tasks during image generation, remain underexplored for discriminative applications. This prompts the question: can generative diffusion models also excel and serve as GFMs with sufficient discriminative power? In this work, we answer this question with SatDiFuser, a framework that transforms a diffusion-based generative geospatial foundation model into a powerful pretraining tool for discriminative RS. By systematically analyzing multi-stage, noise-dependent diffusion features, we develop three fusion strategies to effectively leverage these diverse representations. Extensive experiments on remote sensing benchmarks show that SatDiFuser outperforms state-of-the-art GFMs, achieving gains of up to +5.7% mIoU in semantic segmentation and +7.9% F1-score in classification, demonstrating the capacity of diffusion-based generative foundation models to rival or exceed discriminative GFMs. The source code is available at: https://github.com/yurujaja/SatDiFuser.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, camera ready</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Framework for Diffusion Bridge Problems: Flow Matching and Schrödinger Matching into One](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21756v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The bridge problem is to find an SDE (or sometimes an ODE) that bridges two given distributions. The application areas of the bridge problem are enormous, among which the recent generative modeling (e.g., conditional or unconditional image generation) is the most popular. Also the famous Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem, a widely known problem for a century, is a special instance of the bridge problem. Two most popular algorithms to tackle the bridge problems in the deep learning era are: (conditional) flow matching and iterative fitting algorithms, where the former confined to ODE solutions, and the latter specifically for the Schr\"{o}dinger bridge problem. The main contribution of this article is in two folds: i) We provide concise reviews of these algorithms with technical details to some extent; ii) We propose a novel unified perspective and framework that subsumes these seemingly unrelated algorithms (and their variants) into one. In particular, we show that our unified framework can instantiate the Flow Matching (FM) algorithm, the (mini-batch) optimal transport FM algorithm, the (mini-batch) Schr\"{o}dinger bridge FM algorithm, and the deep Schr\"{o}dinger bridge matching (DSBM) algorithm as its special cases. We believe that this unified framework will be useful for viewing the bridge problems in a more general and flexible perspective, and in turn can help researchers and practitioners to develop new bridge algorithms in their fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Rewarding Large Vision-Language Models for Optimizing Prompts in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16763v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models are powerful for producing high-quality images based on given text prompts, but crafting these prompts often requires specialized vocabulary. To address this, existing methods train rewriting models with supervision from large amounts of manually annotated data and trained aesthetic assessment models. To alleviate the dependence on data scale for model training and the biases introduced by trained models, we propose a novel prompt optimization framework, designed to rephrase a simple user prompt into a sophisticated prompt to a text-to-image model. Specifically, we employ the large vision language models (LVLMs) as the solver to rewrite the user prompt, and concurrently, employ LVLMs as a reward model to score the aesthetics and alignment of the images generated by the optimized prompt. Instead of laborious human feedback, we exploit the prior knowledge of the LVLM to provide rewards, i.e., AI feedback. Simultaneously, the solver and the reward model are unified into one model and iterated in reinforcement learning to achieve self-improvement by giving a solution and judging itself. Results on two popular datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms other strong competitors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Your Image is Secretly the Last Frame of a Pseudo Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20158v3)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models, which can be viewed as a special case of hierarchical variational autoencoders (HVAEs), have shown profound success in generating photo-realistic images. In contrast, standard HVAEs often produce images of inferior quality compared to diffusion models. In this paper, we hypothesize that the success of diffusion models can be partly attributed to the additional self-supervision information for their intermediate latent states provided by corrupted images, which along with the original image form a pseudo video. Based on this hypothesis, we explore the possibility of improving other types of generative models with such pseudo videos. Specifically, we first extend a given image generative model to their video generative model counterpart, and then train the video generative model on pseudo videos constructed by applying data augmentation to the original images. Furthermore, we analyze the potential issues of first-order Markov data augmentation methods, which are typically used in diffusion models, and propose to use more expressive data augmentation to construct more useful information in pseudo videos. Our empirical results on the CIFAR10 and CelebA datasets demonstrate that improved image generation quality can be achieved with additional self-supervised information from pseudo videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the ICLR 2025 Workshop on Deep Generative Model in Machine Learning: Theory, Principle and Efficacy (DeLTa). 1-frame results for CIFAR10 in Table 2 corrected.

| **[ANTS: Shaping the Adaptive Negative Textual Space by MLLM for OOD Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03951v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an understanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate negative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels significantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we propose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the understanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative images and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive negative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance far-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the in-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that are visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning capability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to this subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD detection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an adaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task settings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior knowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet benchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art. Furthermore, our method is training-free and zero-shot, enabling high scalability.</p></details> |  |

To address this challenge, We introduce FLUX-Reason-6M and PRISM-Bench (Precise and Robust Image Synthesis Measurement Benchmark). FLUX-Reason-6M is a massive dataset consisting of 6 million high-quality FLUX-generated images and 20 million bilingual (English and Chinese) descriptions specifically designed to teach complex reasoning. The image are organized according to six key characteristics: Imagination, Entity, Text rendering, Style, Affection, and Composition, and design explicit Generation Chain-of-Thought (GCoT) to provide detailed breakdowns of image generation steps. The whole data curation takes 15,000 A100 GPU days, providing the community with a resource previously unattainable outside of large industrial labs. PRISM-Bench offers a novel evaluation standard with seven distinct tracks, including a formidable Long Text challenge using GCoT. Through carefully designed prompts, it utilizes advanced vision-language models for nuanced human-aligned assessment of prompt-image alignment and image aesthetics. Our extensive evaluation of 19 leading models on PRISM-Bench reveals critical performance gaps and highlights specific areas requiring improvement. Our dataset, benchmark, and evaluation code are released to catalyze the next wave of reasoning-oriented T2I generation.

| **[Mechanistic Learning with Guided Diffusion Models to Predict Spatio-Temporal Brain Tumor Growth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09610v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting the spatio-temporal progression of brain tumors is essential for guiding clinical decisions in neuro-oncology. We propose a hybrid mechanistic learning framework that combines a mathematical tumor growth model with a guided denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM) to synthesize anatomically feasible future MRIs from preceding scans. The mechanistic model, formulated as a system of ordinary differential equations, captures temporal tumor dynamics including radiotherapy effects and estimates future tumor burden. These estimates condition a gradient-guided DDIM, enabling image synthesis that aligns with both predicted growth and patient anatomy. We train our model on the BraTS adult and pediatric glioma datasets and evaluate on 60 axial slices of in-house longitudinal pediatric diffuse midline glioma (DMG) cases. Our framework generates realistic follow-up scans based on spatial similarity metrics. It also introduces tumor growth probability maps, which capture both clinically relevant extent and directionality of tumor growth as shown by 95th percentile Hausdorff Distance. The method enables biologically informed image generation in data-limited scenarios, offering generative-space-time predictions that account for mechanistic priors.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[SV-DRR: High-Fidelity Novel View X-Ray Synthesis Using Diffusion Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05148v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.
