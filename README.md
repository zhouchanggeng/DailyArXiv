However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Gradient Clipping Becomes a Control Mechanism for Differential Privacy in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10584v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review in the Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Confusion Loop: CLIP-Guided Alignment for Source-Free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08730v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) tackles the problem of adapting a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without accessing any source data, which is quite suitable for the field of data security. Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation. Our code can be find at https://github.com/soloiro/CGA</p></details> |  |
| **[UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose UniLIP, a unified framework that adapts CLIP for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

| **[Visual Word Sense Disambiguation with CLIP through Dual-Channel Text Prompting and Image Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06799v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguity poses persistent challenges in natural language understanding for large language models (LLMs). To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, pending journal/workshop submission</p></details> |
| **[FaA-CAF: Modular Single-RF-Chain Near-Field mmWave Sensing via Clip-On Antenna Fabric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06767v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sliced Rényi Pufferfish Privacy: Directional Additive Noise Mechanism and Private Learning with Gradient Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01115v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the design of a privatization mechanism and privacy accounting in the Pufferfish Privacy (PP) family. Specifically, motivated by the curse of dimensionality and lack of practical composition tools for iterative learning in the recent Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (RPP) framework, we propose Sliced Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (SRPP). SRPP preserves PP/RPP semantics (customizable secrets with probability-aware secret-dataset relationships) while replacing high-dimensional Renyi divergence with projection-based quantification via two sliced measures, Average SRPP and Joint SRPP. We develop sliced Wasserstein mechanisms, yielding sound SRPP certificates and closed-form Gaussian noise calibration. For iterative learning systems, we introduce an SRPP-SGD scheme with gradient clipping and new accountants based on History-Uniform Caps (HUC) and a subsampling-aware variant (sa-HUC), enabling decompose-then-compose privatization and additive composition under a common slicing geometry. Experiments on static and iterative privatization show that the proposed framework exhibits favorable privacy-utility trade-offs, as well as practical scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-Map: Structured Matrix Mapping for Parameter-Efficient CLIP Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05909v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Image Translation with Diffusion Transformers and CLIP-Based Image Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16001v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2025 6th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL)</p></details> |
| **[Tight Long-Term Tail Decay of (Clipped) SGD in Non-Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05657v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[CoPE: Clipped RoPE as A Scalable Free Lunch for Long Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05258v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGS-Net: Distillation-Guided Gradient Surgery for CLIP Fine-Tuning in AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13108v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models has led to the widespread proliferation of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy violations, and trust erosion in digital media. Although large-scale multimodal models like CLIP offer strong transferable representations for detecting synthetic content, fine-tuning them often induces catastrophic forgetting, which degrades pre-trained priors and limits cross-domain generalization. To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression. Extensive experiments on 50 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average margin of 6.6, achieving superior detection performance and generalization across diverse generation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gradient Norm Clipping & Non-Euclidean $(L_0,L_1)$-Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01913v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/ClippedScion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less Precise Can Be More Reliable: A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v4)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have revolutionized zero-shot classification and safety-critical tasks, including Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient real-world deployment. While quantization is a standard solution for efficiency, its broader impact on reliability metrics beyond simple Top-1 accuracy remains critically under-explored. In this study, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of VLM quantization across a comprehensive experimental suite of over 700k evaluation runs with varying configurations. We find that, contrary to the assumption that quantization's noise degrades performance, it can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and robustness to noise, though not to covariate shift or spurious correlations. We leverage these counterintuitive findings to characterize the mechanics of quantization beyond simple regularization: we show that quantization dampens high-rank spectral components, compelling the model to rely more heavily on robust, low-rank features. Ultimately, this spectral filtering effect drives the observed improvements in generalization and noise tolerance, establishing a pathway to deploy faster, more reliable VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Explicit Uncertainty Modeling for Active CLIP Adaptation with Dual Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04340v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnHype: CLIP-Guided Hypernetworks for Dynamic LoRA Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03410v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

| **[DIA-CLIP: a universal representation learning framework for zero-shot DIA proteomics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01772v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry (DIA-MS) has established itself as a cornerstone of proteomic profiling and large-scale systems biology, offering unparalleled depth and reproducibility. Current DIA analysis frameworks, however, require semi-supervised training within each run for peptide-spectrum match (PSM) re-scoring. This approach is prone to overfitting and lacks generalizability across diverse species and experimental conditions. Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications. Moreover, DIA-CLIP holds immense potential for diverse practical applications, such as single-cell and spatial proteomics, where its enhanced identification depth facilitates the discovery of novel biomarkers and the elucidates of intricate cellular mechanisms.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Koo-Fu CLIP: Closed-Form Adaptation of Vision-Language Models via Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01127v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-language models such as CLIP provide powerful general-purpose representations, but their raw embeddings are not optimized for supervised classification, often exhibiting limited class separation and excessive dimensionality. We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations. Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[XAI-CLIP: ROI-Guided Perturbation Framework for Explainable Medical Image Segmentation in Multimodal Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07017v1)** | 2026-02-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a critical component of clinical workflows, enabling accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Cosine Similarity: Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 tables, 8 figures</p></details> |

While effective at preventing instability, clipping discards information, introduces gradient discontinuities and can prevent exploration of better policies. Inspired by label smoothing, we propose Probability Smoothing Policy Optimisation (PSPO). PSPO smooths current policy probabilities toward the behaviour policy before computing importance ratios, creating a soft trust region that preserves gradients while preventing destabilising updates. Unlike prior soft clipping approaches that use sigmoid-based transformations which can suffer from vanishing gradients and saturation, our method uses a linear interpolation, providing simpler and more robust gradient preservation. Empirically, GR-PSPO outperforms clipping and sigmoid-based alternatives on mathematical reasoning benchmarks when refining models with prior domain knowledge, achieving an accuracy of 79.9% on GSM8K and 59.6% on MATH for Qwen2-Math-1.5B.</p></details> |  |

Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) addresses this challenge by enabling learning systems to continuously learn new classes while preserving prior knowledge. With the rise of pre-trained models (PTMs) such as CLIP, leveraging their strong generalization and semantic alignment capabilities has become a promising direction in CIL. However, existing CLIP-based CIL methods are often scattered across disparate codebases, rely on inconsistent configurations, hindering fair comparisons, reproducibility, and practical adoption. Therefore, we propose C3Box (CLIP-based Class-inCremental learning toolBOX), a modular and comprehensive Python toolbox. C3Box integrates representative traditional CIL methods, ViT-based CIL methods, and state-of-the-art CLIP-based CIL methods into a unified CLIP-based framework. By inheriting the streamlined design of PyCIL, C3Box provides a JSON-based configuration and standardized execution pipeline. This design enables reproducible experimentation with low engineering overhead and makes C3Box a reliable benchmark platform for continual learning research. Designed to be user-friendly, C3Box relies only on widely used open-source libraries and supports major operating systems.

| **[CLIP-Guided Unsupervised Semantic-Aware Exposure Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19129v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Improper exposure often leads to severe loss of details, color distortion, and reduced contrast. Exposure correction still faces two critical challenges: (1) the ignorance of object-wise regional semantic information causes the color shift artifacts; (2) real-world exposure images generally have no ground-truth labels, and its labeling entails massive manual editing. To tackle the challenges, we propose a new unsupervised semantic-aware exposure correction network. It contains an adaptive semantic-aware fusion module, which effectively fuses the semantic information extracted from a pre-trained Fast Segment Anything Model into a shared image feature space. Then the fused features are used by our multi-scale residual spatial mamba group to restore the details and adjust the exposure. To avoid manual editing, we propose a pseudo-ground truth generator guided by CLIP, which is fine-tuned to automatically identify exposure situations and instruct the tailored corrections. Also, we leverage the rich priors from the FastSAM and CLIP to develop a semantic-prompt consistency loss to enforce semantic consistency and image-prompt alignment for unsupervised training. Comprehensive experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our method in correcting real-world exposure images and outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods both numerically and visually.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Sparse CLIP: Co-Optimizing Interpretability and Performance in Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20075v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has become a cornerstone in vision-language representation learning, powering diverse downstream tasks and serving as the default vision backbone in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Despite its success, CLIP's dense and opaque latent representations pose significant interpretability challenges. A common assumption is that interpretability and performance are in tension: enforcing sparsity during training degrades accuracy, motivating recent post-hoc approaches such as Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs). However, these post-hoc approaches often suffer from degraded downstream performance and loss of CLIP's inherent multimodal capabilities, with most learned features remaining unimodal. We propose a simple yet effective approach that integrates sparsity directly into CLIP training, yielding representations that are both interpretable and performant. Compared to SAEs, our Sparse CLIP representations preserve strong downstream task performance, achieve superior interpretability, and retain multimodal capabilities. We show that multimodal sparse features enable straightforward semantic concept alignment and reveal training dynamics of how cross-modal knowledge emerges. Finally, as a proof of concept, we train a vision-language model on sparse CLIP representations that enables interpretable, vision-based steering capabilities. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom that interpretability requires sacrificing accuracy and demonstrate that interpretability and performance can be co-optimized, offering a promising design principle for future models.</p></details> |  |

While test-time defenses are promising, existing methods fail to provide sufficient robustness against strong attacks and are often hampered by high inference latency and task-specific applicability. To address these limitations, we start by investigating the intrinsic properties of AEs, which reveals that AEs exhibit severe feature inconsistency under progressive frequency attenuation. We further attribute this to the model's inherent spectral bias. Leveraging this insight, we propose an efficient test-time defense named Contrastive Spectral Rectification (CSR). CSR optimizes a rectification perturbation to realign the input with the natural manifold under a spectral-guided contrastive objective, which is applied input-adaptively. Extensive experiments across 16 classification benchmarks demonstrate that CSR outperforms the SOTA by an average of 18.1% against strong AutoAttack with modest inference overhead. Furthermore, CSR exhibits broad applicability across diverse visual tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/Summu77/CSR.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

ProLIP fine-tunes the vision encoder's projection matrix with Frobenius norm regularization on its deviation from the pretrained weights. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on 11 few-shot classification benchmarks under both ``few-shot validation'' and ``validation-free'' settings. Moreover, by rethinking the non-linear CLIP-Adapter through ProLIP's lens, we design a Regularized Linear Adapter (RLA) that performs better, requires no hyperparameter tuning, is less sensitive to learning rate values, and offers an alternative to ProLIP in black-box scenarios where model weights are inaccessible. Beyond few-shot classification, ProLIP excels in cross-dataset transfer, domain generalization, base-to-new class generalization, and test-time adaptation--where it outperforms prompt tuning while being an order of magnitude faster to train.

However, existing methods predominantly rely on coarse-grained global alignment, which often overlooks the dense, multi-scale semantics inherent in overhead imagery. Moreover, adapting these heavy models via full fine-tuning incurs prohibitive computational costs and risks catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose MPS-CLIP, a parameter-efficient framework designed to shift the retrieval paradigm from global matching to keyword-guided fine-grained alignment. Specifically, we leverage a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract core semantic keywords, guiding the Segment Anything Model (SamGeo) to generate semantically relevant sub-perspectives. To efficiently adapt the frozen backbone, we introduce a Gated Global Attention (G^2A) adapter, which captures global context and long-range dependencies with minimal overhead. Furthermore, a Multi-Perspective Representation (MPR) module aggregates these local cues into robust multi-perspective embeddings. The framework is optimized via a hybrid objective combining multi-perspective contrastive and weighted triplet losses, which dynamically selects maximum-response perspectives to suppress noise and enforce precise semantic matching. Extensive experiments on the RSICD and RSITMD benchmarks demonstrate that MPS-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance with 35.18% and 48.40% mean Recall (mR), respectively, significantly outperforming full fine-tuning baselines and recent competitive methods.

| **[CM2: Reinforcement Learning with Checklist Rewards for Multi-Turn and Multi-Step Agentic Tool Use](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12268v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI agents are increasingly used to solve real-world tasks by reasoning over multi-turn user interactions and invoking external tools. However, applying reinforcement learning to such settings remains difficult: realistic objectives often lack verifiable rewards and instead emphasize open-ended behaviors; moreover, RL for multi-turn, multi-step agentic tool use is still underexplored; and building and maintaining executable tool environments is costly, limiting scale and coverage. We propose CM2, an RL framework that replaces verifiable outcome rewards with checklist rewards. CM2 decomposes each turn's intended behavior into fine-grained binary criteria with explicit evidence grounding and structured metadata, turning open-ended judging into more stable classification-style decisions. To balance stability and informativeness, our method adopts a strategy of sparse reward assignment but dense evaluation criteria. Training is performed in a scalable LLM-simulated tool environment, avoiding heavy engineering for large tool sets. Experiments show that CM2 consistently improves over supervised fine-tuning. Starting from an 8B Base model and training on an 8k-example RL dataset, CM2 improves over the SFT counterpart by 8 points on tau^-Bench, by 10 points on BFCL-V4, and by 12 points on ToolSandbox. The results match or even outperform similarly sized open-source baselines, including the judging model. CM2 thus provides a scalable recipe for optimizing multi-turn, multi-step tool-using agents without relying on verifiable rewards.

| **[EGG-SR: Embedding Symbolic Equivalence into Symbolic Regression via Equality Graph](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05849v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression seeks to uncover physical laws from experimental data by searching for closed-form expressions, which is an important task in AI-driven scientific discovery. Yet the exponential growth of the search space of expression renders the task computationally challenging. A promising yet underexplored direction for reducing the search space and accelerating training lies in *symbolic equivalence*: many expressions, although syntactically different, define the same function -- for example, $\log(x_1^2x_2^3)$, $\log(x_1^2)+\log(x_2^3)$, and $2\log(x_1)+3\log(x_2)$. Existing algorithms treat such variants as distinct outputs, leading to redundant exploration and slow learning. We introduce EGG-SR, a unified framework that integrates symbolic equivalence into a class of modern symbolic regression methods, including Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), and Large Language Models (LLMs). EGG-SR compactly represents equivalent expressions through the proposed EGG module (via equality graphs), accelerating learning by: (1) pruning redundant subtree exploration in EGG-MCTS, (2) aggregating rewards across equivalent generated sequences in EGG-DRL, and (3) enriching feedback prompts in EGG-LLM. Theoretically, we show the benefit of embedding EGG into learning: it tightens the regret bound of MCTS and reduces the variance of the DRL gradient estimator. Empirically, EGG-SR consistently enhances a class of symbolic regression models across several benchmarks, discovering more accurate expressions within the same time limit.

In contrast, Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning (QRL) studies goal-conditioned control through directed distance values (cost-to-go) that support reaching goals under asymmetric dynamics. In this short article, we connect these viewpoints by restricting attention to a principled class of JEPA energy functions : intrinsic (least-action) energies, defined as infima of accumulated local effort over admissible trajectories between two states. Under mild closure and additivity assumptions, any intrinsic energy is a quasimetric. In goal-reaching control, optimal cost-to-go functions admit exactly this intrinsic form ; inversely, JEPAs trained to model intrinsic energies lie in the quasimetric value class targeted by QRL. Moreover, we observe why symmetric finite energies are structurally mismatched with one-way reachability, motivating asymmetric (quasimetric) energies when directionality matters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Any House Any Task: Scalable Long-Horizon Planning for Abstract Human Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12244v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open world language conditioned task planning is crucial for robots operating in large-scale household environments. While many recent works attempt to address this problem using Large Language Models (LLMs) via prompting or training, a key challenge remains scalability. Performance often degrades rapidly with increasing environment size, plan length, instruction ambiguity, and constraint complexity. In this work, we propose Any House Any Task (AHAT), a household task planner optimized for long-horizon planning in large environments given ambiguous human instructions. At its core, AHAT utilizes an LLM trained to map task instructions and textual scene graphs into grounded subgoals defined in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). These subgoals are subsequently solved to generate feasible and optimal long-horizon plans through explicit symbolic reasoning. To enhance the model's ability to decompose complex and ambiguous intentions, we introduce TGPO, a novel reinforcement learning algorithm that integrates external correction of intermediate reasoning traces into Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments demonstrate that AHAT achieves significant performance gains over state-of-the-art prompting, planning, and learning methods, particularly in human-style household tasks characterized by brief instructions but requiring complex execution plans.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Pareto Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Objective Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03580v4)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing multiple objectives simultaneously is an important task for recommendation platforms to improve their performance. However, this task is particularly challenging since the relationships between different objectives are heterogeneous across different consumers and dynamically fluctuating according to different contexts. Especially in those cases when objectives become conflicting with each other, the result of recommendations will form a pareto-frontier, where the improvements of any objective comes at the cost of a performance decrease of another objective. Existing multi-objective recommender systems do not systematically consider such dynamic relationships; instead, they balance between these objectives in a static and uniform manner, resulting in only suboptimal multi-objective recommendation performance. In this paper, we propose a Deep Pareto Reinforcement Learning (DeepPRL) approach, where we (1) comprehensively model the complex relationships between multiple objectives in recommendations; (2) effectively capture personalized and contextual consumer preference for each objective to provide better recommendations; (3) optimize both the short-term and the long-term performance of multi-objective recommendations. As a result, our method achieves significant pareto-dominance over the state-of-the-art baselines in the offline experiments. Furthermore, we conducted a controlled experiment at the video streaming platform of Alibaba, where our method simultaneously improved three conflicting business objectives over the latest production system significantly, demonstrating its tangible economic impact in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preliminary version of the paper accepted at MISQ: https://doi.org/10.25300/MISQ/2025/19488 Please do not cite this version</p></details> |
| **[Towards On-Policy SFT: Distribution Discriminant Theory and its Applications in LLM Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12222v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is computationally efficient but often yields inferior generalization compared to reinforcement learning (RL). This gap is primarily driven by RL's use of on-policy data. We propose a framework to bridge this chasm by enabling On-Policy SFT. We first present \textbf{\textit{Distribution Discriminant Theory (DDT)}}, which explains and quantifies the alignment between data and the model-induced distribution. Leveraging DDT, we introduce two complementary techniques: (i) \textbf{\textit{In-Distribution Finetuning (IDFT)}}, a loss-level method to enhance generalization ability of SFT, and (ii) \textbf{\textit{Hinted Decoding}}, a data-level technique that can re-align the training corpus to the model's distribution. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves generalization performance on par with prominent offline RL algorithms, including DPO and SimPO, while maintaining the efficiency of an SFT pipeline. The proposed framework thus offers a practical alternative in domains where RL is infeasible. We open-source the code here: https://github.com/zhangmiaosen2000/Towards-On-Policy-SFT</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Rewards in Reinforcement Learning for Cyber Defence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04809v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have seen an explosion of interest in autonomous cyber defence agents trained to defend computer networks using deep reinforcement learning. These agents are typically trained in cyber gym environments using dense, highly engineered reward functions which combine many penalties and incentives for a range of (un)desirable states and costly actions. Dense rewards help alleviate the challenge of exploring complex environments but risk biasing agents towards suboptimal and potentially riskier solutions, a critical issue in complex cyber environments. We thoroughly evaluate the impact of reward function structure on learning and policy behavioural characteristics using a variety of sparse and dense reward functions, two well-established cyber gyms, a range of network sizes, and both policy gradient and value-based RL algorithms. Our evaluation is enabled by a novel ground truth evaluation approach which allows directly comparing between different reward functions, illuminating the nuanced inter-relationships between rewards, action space and the risks of suboptimal policies in cyber environments. Our results show that sparse rewards, provided they are goal aligned and can be encountered frequently, uniquely offer both enhanced training reliability and more effective cyber defence agents with lower-risk policies. Surprisingly, sparse rewards can also yield policies that are better aligned with cyber defender goals and make sparing use of costly defensive actions without explicit reward-based numerical penalties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chatting with Images for Introspective Visual Thinking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11073v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large vision-language models (LVLMs) typically rely on text-only reasoning based on a single-pass visual encoding, which often leads to loss of fine-grained visual information. Recently the proposal of ''thinking with images'' attempts to alleviate this limitation by manipulating images via external tools or code; however, the resulting visual states are often insufficiently grounded in linguistic semantics, impairing effective cross-modal alignment - particularly when visual semantics or geometric relationships must be reasoned over across distant regions or multiple images. To address these challenges, we propose ''chatting with images'', a new framework that reframes visual manipulation as language-guided feature modulation. Under the guidance of expressive language prompts, the model dynamically performs joint re-encoding over multiple image regions, enabling tighter coupling between linguistic reasoning and visual state updates. We instantiate this paradigm in ViLaVT, a novel LVLM equipped with a dynamic vision encoder explicitly designed for such interactive visual reasoning, and trained it with a two-stage curriculum combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to promote effective reasoning behaviors. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks demonstrate that ViLaVT achieves strong and consistent improvements, with particularly pronounced gains on complex multi-image and video-based spatial reasoning tasks.</p></details> |  |

Traditional compression techniques, such as dictionary-based and statistical methods, often struggle to optimally exploit the structure and redundancy in complex data formats. Recent advancements in deep learning have opened new avenues for compression; however, many existing approaches depend on dense vector representations that obscure the underlying token structure. To address these limitations, we propose a novel lossless compression method that leverages Reinforcement Learning applied to a T5 language model architecture. This approach enables the compression of data into sequences of tokens rather than traditional vector representations. Unlike auto-encoders, which typically encode information into continuous latent spaces, our method preserves the token-based structure, aligning more closely with the original data format. This preservation allows for higher compression ratios while maintaining semantic integrity. By training the model using an off-policy Reinforcement Learning algorithm, we optimize sequence length to minimize redundancy and enhance compression efficiency. Our method introduces an efficient and adaptive data compression system built upon advanced Reinforcement Learning techniques, functioning independently of external grammatical or world knowledge. This approach shows significant improvements in compression ratios compared to conventional methods. By leveraging the latent information within language models, our system effectively compresses data without requiring explicit content understanding, paving the way for more robust and practical compression solutions across various applications.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we first theoretically show that OPD is a special case of dense KL-constrained RL where the reward function and the KL regularization are always weighted equally and the reference model can by any model. Then, we propose the Generalized On-Policy Distillation (G-OPD) framework, which extends the standard OPD objective by introducing a flexible reference model and a reward scaling factor that controls the relative weight of the reward term against the KL regularization. Through comprehensive experiments on math reasoning and code generation tasks, we derive two novel insights: (1) Setting the reward scaling factor to be greater than 1 (i.e., reward extrapolation), which we term ExOPD, consistently improves over standard OPD across a range of teacher-student size pairings. In particular, in the setting where we merge the knowledge from different domain experts, obtained by applying domain-specific RL to the same student model, back into the original student, ExOPD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's performance boundary and outperform the domain teachers. (2) Building on ExOPD, we further find that in the strong-to-weak distillation setting (i.e., distilling a smaller student from a larger teacher), performing reward correction by choosing the reference model as the teacher's base model before RL yields a more accurate reward signal and further improves distillation performance. However, this choice assumes access to the teacher's pre-RL variant and incurs more computational overhead. We hope our work offers new insights for future research on OPD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress. Github repo: https://github.com/RUCBM/G-OPD</p></details> |
| **[Capability-Oriented Training Induced Alignment Risk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12124v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most AI alignment research focuses on preventing models from generating explicitly harmful content, a more subtle risk is emerging: capability-oriented training induced exploitation. We investigate whether language models, when trained with reinforcement learning (RL) in environments with implicit loopholes, will spontaneously learn to exploit these flaws to maximize their reward, even without any malicious intent in their training. To test this, we design a suite of four diverse "vulnerability games", each presenting a unique, exploitable flaw related to context-conditional compliance, proxy metrics, reward tampering, and self-evaluation. Our experiments show that models consistently learn to exploit these vulnerabilities, discovering opportunistic strategies that significantly increase their reward at the expense of task correctness or safety. More critically, we find that these exploitative strategies are not narrow "tricks" but generalizable skills; they can be transferred to new tasks and even "distilled" from a capable teacher model to other student models through data alone. Our findings reveal that capability-oriented training induced risks pose a fundamental challenge to current alignment approaches, suggesting that future AI safety work must extend beyond content moderation to rigorously auditing and securing the training environments and reward mechanisms themselves.

We propose Meta-Sel, a lightweight supervised meta-learning approach for intent classification that learns a fast, interpretable scoring function for (candidate, query) pairs from labeled training data. Meta-Sel constructs a meta-dataset by sampling pairs from the training split and using class agreement as supervision, then trains a calibrated logistic regressor on two inexpensive meta-features: TF--IDF cosine similarity and a length-compatibility ratio. At inference time, the selector performs a single vectorized scoring pass over the full candidate pool and returns the top-k demonstrations, requiring no model fine-tuning, no online exploration, and no additional LLM calls. This yields deterministic rankings and makes the selection mechanism straightforward to audit via interpretable feature weights. Beyond proposing Meta-Sel, we provide a broad empirical study of demonstration selection, benchmarking 12 methods -- spanning prompt engineering baselines, heuristic selection, reinforcement learning, and influence-based approaches -- across four intent datasets and five open-source LLMs. Across this benchmark, Meta-Sel consistently ranks among the top-performing methods, is particularly effective for smaller models where selection quality can partially compensate for limited model capacity, and maintains competitive selection-time overhead.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge is obtaining accurate, user-specific reward signals in open-ended scenarios. Existing personalized reward models face two persistent limitations: (1) oversimplifying diverse, scenario-specific preferences into a small, fixed set of evaluation principles, and (2) struggling with generalization to new users with limited feedback. To this end, we propose P-GenRM, the first Personalized Generative Reward Model with test-time user-based scaling. P-GenRM transforms preference signals into structured evaluation chains that derive adaptive personas and scoring rubrics across various scenarios. It further clusters users into User Prototypes and introduces a dual-granularity scaling mechanism: at the individual level, it adaptively scales and aggregates each user's scoring scheme; at the prototype level, it incorporates preferences from similar users. This design mitigates noise in inferred preferences and enhances generalization to unseen users through prototype-based transfer. Empirical results show that P-GenRM achieves state-of-the-art results on widely-used personalized reward model benchmarks, with an average improvement of 2.31%, and demonstrates strong generalization on an out-of-distribution dataset. Notably, Test-time User-based scaling provides an additional 3% boost, demonstrating stronger personalized alignment with test-time scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as ICLR 2026 Oral</p></details> |

While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn, multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To address these challenges, we introduce MARSHAL, an end-to-end RL framework that incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning through Self-play witH strAtegic LLMs in both cooperative and competitive games. MARSHAL features a turn-level advantage estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and competitive games, MARSHAL agents trained from Qwen3-4B develop strong strategic abilities, with up to 28.7% performance improvements in held-out games. More importantly, the capability acquired through self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of MASs in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading MASs, our MARSHAL agent achieves significant zero-shot performance gains of up to 10.0% on AIME, 7.6% on GPQA-Diamond, and 3.5% on average across all benchmarks. These results establish self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, they often generate over-long chains-of-thought that, driven by substantial reflections such as repetitive self-questioning and circular reasoning, lead to high token consumption, substantial computational overhead, and increased latency without improving accuracy, particularly in smaller models. Our observation reveals that increasing problem complexity induces more excessive and unnecessary reflection, which in turn reduces accuracy and increases token overhead. To address this challenge, we propose Adaptive Reflection and Length Coordinated Penalty (ARLCP), a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to dynamically balance reasoning efficiency and solution accuracy. ARLCP introduces two key innovations: (1) a reflection penalty that adaptively curtails unnecessary reflective steps while preserving essential reasoning, and (2) a length penalty calibrated to the estimated complexity of the problem. By coordinating these penalties, ARLCP encourages the model to generate more concise and effective reasoning paths. We evaluate our method on five mathematical reasoning benchmarks using DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B models. Experimental results show that ARLCP achieves a superior efficiency-accuracy trade-off compared to existing approaches. For the 1.5B model, it reduces the average response length by 53.1% while simultaneously improving accuracy by 5.8%.

| **[On the Complexity of Offline Reinforcement Learning with $Q^\star$-Approximation and Partial Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12107v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study offline reinforcement learning under $Q^\star$-approximation and partial coverage, a setting that motivates practical algorithms such as Conservative $Q$-Learning (CQL; Kumar et al., 2020) but has received limited theoretical attention. Our work is inspired by the following open question: "Are $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness sufficient for sample-efficient offline RL under partial coverage?" We answer in the negative by establishing an information-theoretic lower bound. Going substantially beyond this, we introduce a general framework that characterizes the intrinsic complexity of a given $Q^\star$ function class, inspired by model-free decision-estimation coefficients (DEC) for online RL (Foster et al., 2023b; Liu et al., 2025b). This complexity recovers and improves the quantities underlying the guarantees of Chen and Jiang (2022) and Uehara et al. (2023), and extends to broader settings. Our decision-estimation decomposition can be combined with a wide range of $Q^\star$ estimation procedures, modularizing and generalizing existing approaches. Beyond the general framework, we make further contributions: By developing a novel second-order performance difference lemma, we obtain the first $ε^{-2}$ sample complexity under partial coverage for soft $Q$-learning, improving the $ε^{-4}$ bound of Uehara et al. (2023). We remove Chen and Jiang's (2022) need for additional online interaction when the value gap of $Q^\star$ is unknown. We also give the first characterization of offline learnability for general low-Bellman-rank MDPs without Bellman completeness (Jiang et al., 2017; Du et al., 2021; Jin et al., 2021), a canonical setting in online RL that remains unexplored in offline RL except for special cases. Finally, we provide the first analysis for CQL under $Q^\star$-realizability and Bellman completeness beyond the tabular case.</p></details> |  |

In contrast, video world models pre-trained on web-scale video corpora exhibit robust spatiotemporal reasoning and accurate future prediction, making them a natural foundation for enhancing VLA learning. Therefore, we propose \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*}, a VLA model trained via world model-based reinforcement learning. Built upon \textit{GigaBrain-0.5}, which is pre-trained on over 10,000 hours of robotic manipulation data, whose intermediate version currently ranks first on the international RoboChallenge benchmark. \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M*} further integrates world model-based reinforcement learning via \textit{RAMP} (Reinforcement leArning via world Model-conditioned Policy) to enable robust cross-task adaptation. Empirical results demonstrate that \textit{RAMP} achieves substantial performance gains over the RECAP baseline, yielding improvements of approximately 30\% on challenging tasks including \texttt{Laundry Folding}, \texttt{Box Packing}, and \texttt{Espresso Preparation}. Critically, \textit{GigaBrain-0.5M$^*$} exhibits reliable long-horizon execution, consistently accomplishing complex manipulation tasks without failure as validated by real-world deployment videos on our \href{https://gigabrain05m.github.io}{project page}.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://gigabrain05m.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Geometry of Uncertainty: Learning Metric Spaces for Multimodal State Estimation in RL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12087v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the state of an environment from high-dimensional, multimodal, and noisy observations is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Traditional approaches rely on probabilistic models to account for the uncertainty, but often require explicit noise assumptions, in turn limiting generalization. In this work, we contribute a novel method to learn a structured latent representation, in which distances between states directly correlate with the minimum number of actions required to transition between them. The proposed metric space formulation provides a geometric interpretation of uncertainty without the need for explicit probabilistic modeling. To achieve this, we introduce a multimodal latent transition model and a sensor fusion mechanism based on inverse distance weighting, allowing for the adaptive integration of multiple sensor modalities without prior knowledge of noise distributions. We empirically validate the approach on a range of multimodal RL tasks, demonstrating improved robustness to sensor noise and superior state estimation compared to baseline methods. Our experiments show enhanced performance of an RL agent via the learned representation, eliminating the need of explicit noise augmentation. The presented results suggest that leveraging transition-aware metric spaces provides a principled and scalable solution for robust state estimation in sequential decision-making.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, demonstrated autonomous skills remain limited and are typically restricted to controlled environments. In this paper, we present the Humanoid Manipulation Interface (HuMI), a portable and efficient framework for learning diverse whole-body manipulation tasks across various environments. HuMI enables robot-free data collection by capturing rich whole-body motion using portable hardware. This data drives a hierarchical learning pipeline that translates human motions into dexterous and feasible humanoid skills. Extensive experiments across five whole-body tasks--including kneeling, squatting, tossing, walking, and bimanual manipulation--demonstrate that HuMI achieves a 3x increase in data collection efficiency compared to teleoperation and attains a 70% success rate in unseen environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website: https://humanoid-manipulation-interface.github.io</p></details> |

We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies focus on better exploiting limited training data by prioritizing hard prompts whose rollout pass rate is 0. However, easy prompts with a pass rate of 1 also become increasingly prevalent as training progresses, thereby reducing the effective data size. To mitigate this, we propose Composition-RL, a simple yet useful approach for better utilizing limited verifiable prompts targeting pass-rate-1 prompts. More specifically, Composition-RL automatically composes multiple problems into a new verifiable question and uses these compositional prompts for RL training. Extensive experiments across model sizes from 4B to 30B show that Composition-RL consistently improves reasoning capability over RL trained on the original dataset. Performance can be further boosted with a curriculum variant of Composition-RL that gradually increases compositional depth over training. Additionally, Composition-RL enables more effective cross-domain RL by composing prompts drawn from different domains. Codes, datasets, and models are available at https://github.com/XinXU-USTC/Composition-RL.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, this paper targets to develop a unified framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. In this unified setting, the {interplay} between diverse modalities and the dual requirements of simultaneous detection and localization pose a critical ``difficulty bias`` problem: the simpler veracity classification task tends to dominate the gradients, leading to suboptimal performance in fine-grained grounding during multi-task optimization. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{OmniVL-Guard}, a balanced reinforcement learning framework for omnibus vision-language forgery detection and grounding. Particularly, OmniVL-Guard comprises two core designs: Self-Evolving CoT Generatio and Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO). {Self-Evolving CoT Generation} synthesizes high-quality reasoning paths, effectively overcoming the cold-start challenge. Building upon this, {Adaptive Reward Scaling Policy Optimization (ARSPO)} dynamically modulates reward scales and task weights, ensuring a balanced joint optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OmniVL-Guard significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and exhibits zero-shot robust generalization across out-of-domain scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, DeepFake Detection</p></details> |

Existing methods based on model level or representation level knowledge transfer either require expensive local training or incur high communication costs and introduce unavoidable privacy risks. We reformulate this problem as a reinforcement learning style evaluation process and propose FedGRPO, a privacy preserving framework comprising two modules. The first module performs competence-based expert selection by building a lightweight confidence graph from auxiliary data to identify the most suitable clients for each question. The second module leverages the "Group Relative" concept from the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework by packaging each question together with its solution rationale into candidate policies, dispatching these policies to a selected subset of expert clients, and aggregating solely the resulting scalar reward signals via a federated group-relative loss function. By exchanging reward values instead of data or model updates, FedGRPO reduces privacy risk and communication overhead while enabling parallel evaluation across heterogeneous devices. Empirical results on diverse domain tasks demonstrate that FedGRPO achieves superior downstream accuracy and communication efficiency compared to conventional FedFMs baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 as Oral</p></details> |
| **[Accelerating Robotic Reinforcement Learning with Agent Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11978v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a powerful paradigm for autonomous robots to master generalist manipulation skills through trial-and-error. However, its real-world application is stifled by severe sample inefficiency. Recent Human-in-the-Loop (HIL) methods accelerate training by using human corrections, yet this approach faces a scalability barrier. Reliance on human supervisors imposes a 1:1 supervision ratio that limits fleet expansion, suffers from operator fatigue over extended sessions, and introduces high variance due to inconsistent human proficiency. We present Agent-guided Policy Search (AGPS), a framework that automates the training pipeline by replacing human supervisors with a multimodal agent. Our key insight is that the agent can be viewed as a semantic world model, injecting intrinsic value priors to structure physical exploration. By using executable tools, the agent provides precise guidance via corrective waypoints and spatial constraints for exploration pruning. We validate our approach on two tasks, ranging from precision insertion to deformable object manipulation. Results demonstrate that AGPS outperforms HIL methods in sample efficiency. This automates the supervision pipeline, unlocking the path to labor-free and scalable robot learning. Project website: https://agps-rl.github.io/agps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Reinforcement Learning and Search for Flight Trajectory Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04100v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the combination of Reinforcement Learning (RL) and search-based path planners to speed up the optimization of flight paths for airliners, where in case of emergency a fast route re-calculation can be crucial. The fundamental idea is to train an RL Agent to pre-compute near-optimal paths based on location and atmospheric data and use those at runtime to constrain the underlying path planning solver and find a solution within a certain distance from the initial guess. The approach effectively reduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route optimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results conducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption remains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations typically within 1%. At the same time, computation speed can be improved by up to 50% as compared to using a conventional solver alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Incom...</summary><p>Incomplete and outdated, working on improved and clearer version</p></details> |

Unlike prior static or synchronous evaluations, Gaia2 introduces scenarios where environments evolve independently of agent actions, requiring agents to operate under temporal constraints, adapt to noisy and dynamic events, resolve ambiguity, and collaborate with other agents. Each scenario is paired with a write-action verifier, enabling fine-grained, action-level evaluation and making Gaia2 directly usable for reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source models shows that no model dominates across capabilities: GPT-5 (high) reaches the strongest overall score of 42% pass@1 but fails on time-sensitive tasks, Claude-4 Sonnet trades accuracy and speed for cost, Kimi-K2 leads among open-source models with 21% pass@1. These results highlight fundamental trade-offs between reasoning, efficiency, robustness, and expose challenges in closing the "sim2real" gap. Gaia2 is built on a consumer environment with the open-source Agents Research Environments platform and designed to be easy to extend. By releasing Gaia2 alongside the foundational ARE framework, we aim to provide the community with a flexible infrastructure for developing, benchmarking, and training the next generation of practical agent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Oral at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We extend and apply Puzzle, a post-training neural architecture search (NAS) framework, to gpt-oss-120B to produce gpt-oss-puzzle-88B, a deployment-optimized derivative. Our approach combines heterogeneous MoE expert pruning, selective replacement of full-context attention with window attention, FP8 KV-cache quantization with calibrated scales, and post-training reinforcement learning to recover accuracy, while maintaining low generation length. In terms of per-token speeds, on an 8XH100 node we achieve 1.63X and 1.22X throughput speedups in long-context and short-context settings, respectively. gpt-oss-puzzle-88B also delivers throughput speedups of 2.82X on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU. However, because token counts can change with reasoning effort and model variants, per-token throughput (tok/s) and latency (ms/token) do not necessarily lead to end-to-end speedups: a 2X throughput gain is erased if traces grow 2X. Conversely, throughput gains can be spent on more reasoning tokens to improve accuracy; we therefore advocate request-level efficiency metrics that normalize throughput by tokens generated and trace an accuracy--speed frontier across reasoning efforts. We show that gpt-oss-puzzle-88B improves over gpt-oss-120B along the entire frontier, delivering up to 1.29X higher request-level efficiency. Across various benchmarks, gpt-oss-puzzle-88B matches or slightly exceeds the parent on suite-average accuracy across reasoning efforts, with retention ranging from 100.8% (high) to 108.2% (low), showing that post-training architecture search can substantially reduce inference costs without sacrificing quality.</p></details> |  |

However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI), 2026</p></details> |

This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was supported by the Afeyan Family Foundation Seed Grants and the JACE Foundation Research Innovation Grant Program at AUA</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Unlabeled Scans for NCCT Image Segmentation in Early Stroke Diagnosis: A Semi-Supervised GAN Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19576v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ischemic stroke is a time-critical medical emergency where rapid diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion Models for Abdominal Lymph Node Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17770v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success achieved by deep learning methods in medical image segmentation, researchers still struggle in the computer-aided diagnosis of abdominal lymph nodes due to the complex abdominal environment, small and indistinguishable lesions, and limited annotated data. To address these problems, we present a pipeline that integrates the conditional diffusion model for lymph node generation and the nnU-Net model for lymph node segmentation to improve the segmentation performance of abdominal lymph nodes through synthesizing a diversity of realistic abdominal lymph node data. We propose LN-DDPM, a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for lymph node (LN) generation. LN-DDPM utilizes lymph node masks and anatomical structure masks as model conditions. These conditions work in two conditioning mechanisms: global structure conditioning and local detail conditioning, to distinguish between lymph nodes and their surroundings and better capture lymph node characteristics. The obtained paired abdominal lymph node images and masks are used for the downstream segmentation task. Experimental results on the abdominal lymph node datasets demonstrate that LN-DDPM outperforms other generative methods in the abdominal lymph node image synthesis and better assists the downstream abdominal lymph node segmentation task.</p></details> |  |

In addition, there are significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the images. Our dataset includes images with several real-world challenges, including noise, camera distortions, glare, varying lighting conditions, varying field of view, partial spacecraft visibility, brightly-lit city backgrounds, densely patterned and confounding backgrounds, aurora borealis, and a wide variety of spacecraft geometries. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models for spacecraft segmentation to generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of 0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second. The dataset and models for performance benchmark are available at https://github.com/RiceD2KLab/SWiM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM): Instance Deformation for Image Manipulation and Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07295v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, the diffusion models have shown great potential for synthetic image generation tasks. However, these approaches often lack the interpretable connections between the generated and real images and can create anatomically implausible structures or illusions. To address these limitations, we propose the Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), a novel diffusion-based generative model that emphasises morphological transformation through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. DRDM introduces a topology-preserving deformation field generation strategy, which randomly samples and integrates multi-scale Deformation Velocity Fields (DVFs). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unrealistic deformation components, thus restoring randomly deformed images to a realistic distribution. This formulation enables the generation of diverse yet anatomically plausible deformations that preserve structural integrity, thereby improving data augmentation and synthesis for downstream tasks such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experiments on cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging and pulmonary Computed Tomography show that DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large-scale deformations, while maintaining anatomical plausibility of deformation fields. Additional evaluations on 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration tasks indicate notable performance gains, underscoring DRDM's potential to enhance both image manipulation and generative modelling in medical imaging applications.

The airway tree modeling on CT images can provide the experts with 3-dimension measurements like wall thickness, etc. This information can tremendously aid the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1-4]. Many scholars have attempted various ways to model the lung airway tree, which can be split into two major categories based on its nature. Namely, the model-based approach and the deep learning approach. The performance of a typical model-based approach usually depends on the manual tuning of the model parameter, which can be its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is its don't require a large amount of training data which can be beneficial for a small dataset like medical imaging. On the other hand, the performance of model-based may be a misconcep-tion [5,6]. In recent years, deep learning has achieved good results in the field of medical image processing, and many scholars have used UNet-based methods in medical image segmentation [7-11]. Among all the variation of UNet, the UNet 3+ [11] have relatively good result compare to the rest of the variation of UNet. Therefor to further improve the accuracy of lung airway tree modeling, this study combines the Frangi filter [5] with UNet 3+ [11] to develop a dual-channel 3D UNet 3+.

We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.</p></details> |  |

A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks. Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation. We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.</p></details> |  |

Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts.

Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 16pages, 10 figures |
| **[Not All Pixels Are Equal: Pixel-wise Meta-Learning for Medical Segmentation with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18894v4)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, limiting its application in real-world scenarios. Existing methods often directly adapt noisy label learning techniques designed for instance classification, overlooking the pixel-wise heterogeneity in medical segmentation with its spatially and anatomically varying difficulties. Consequently, global assumptions or simple confidence metrics fail to address these local variations, leaving boundary ambiguities unresolved. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Differentiable Bidirectional Dual-Task Synergistic Learning for Semi-Supervised 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09378v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semi-supervised learning relaxes the need of large pixel-wise labeled datasets for image segmentation by leveraging unlabeled data. The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications. The code will be released on github upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ESWA 2026</p></details> |

However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Vision Foundation Models Foundational for Electron Microscopy Image Segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08505v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although vision foundation models (VFMs) are increasingly reused for biomedical image analysis, it remains unclear whether the latent representations they provide are general enough to support effective transfer and reuse across heterogeneous microscopy image datasets. Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fréchet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing SSL frameworks are fundamentally "inward-looking", recycling information and biases solely from within the target dataset. This design triggers a vicious cycle of confirmation bias under class imbalance, leading to the catastrophic failure to recognize minority classes. To dismantle this systemic issue, we propose a paradigm shift to a multi-level "outward-looking" framework. Our primary innovation is Foundational Knowledge Distillation (FKD), which looks outward beyond the confines of medical imaging by introducing a pre-trained visual foundation model, DINOv3, as an unbiased external semantic teacher. Instead of trusting the student's biased high confidence, our method distills knowledge from DINOv3's robust understanding of high semantic uniqueness, providing a stable, cross-domain supervisory signal that anchors the learning of minority classes. To complement this core strategy, we further look outward within the data by proposing Progressive Imbalance-aware CutMix (PIC), which creates a dynamic curriculum that adaptively forces the model to focus on minority classes in both labeled and unlabeled subsets. This layered strategy forms our framework, DINO-Mix, which breaks the vicious cycle of bias and achieves remarkable performance on challenging semi-supervised class-imbalanced medical image segmentation benchmarks Synapse and AMOS.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence with Biased or Scarce Data (Oral)</p></details> |

Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset. Additionally, we conduct case studies on lane detection using a customized indoor track dataset and simulated driving scenarios in CARLA, where we further evaluate the model's generalizability under diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A hybrid Kolmogorov-Arnold network for medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07702v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in diagnosis and treatment planning, but remains challenging due to the inherent complexity and variability of medical images, especially in capturing non-linear relationships within the data. We propose U-KABS, a novel hybrid framework that integrates the expressive power of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) with a U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture to enhance segmentation performance. The U-KABS model combines the convolutional and squeeze-and-excitation stage, which enhances channel-wise feature representations, and the KAN Bernstein Spline (KABS) stage, which employs learnable activation functions based on Bernstein polynomials and B-splines. This hybrid design leverages the global smoothness of Bernstein polynomials and the local adaptability of B-splines, enabling the model to effectively capture both broad contextual trends and fine-grained patterns critical for delineating complex structures in medical images. Skip connections between encoder and decoder layers support effective multi-scale feature fusion and preserve spatial details. Evaluated across diverse medical imaging benchmark datasets, U-KABS demonstrates superior performance compared to strong baselines, particularly in segmenting complex anatomical structures.</p></details> |  |

The approach combines geological modelling, synthetic data generation, and supervised image segmentation to address limited real data and class imbalance. First, discrete fracture network models are used to generate synthetic jointed rock images at field-relevant scales via parametric modelling, preserving joint persistence, connectivity, and node-type distributions. Second, segmentation models are trained using mixed training and pretraining followed by fine-tuning on real images. The method is tested in box and slope domains using several real datasets. The results show that synthetic data can support supervised joint trace detection when real data are scarce. Mixed training performs well when real labels are consistent (e.g. box-domain), while fine-tuning is more robust when labels are noisy (e.g. slope-domain where labels can be biased, incomplete, and inconsistent). Fully zero-shot prediction from synthetic model remains limited, but useful generalisation is achieved by fine-tuning with a small number of real data. Qualitative analysis shows clearer and more geologically meaningful joint traces than indicated by quantitative metrics alone. The proposed method supports reliable joint mapping and provides a basis for further work on domain adaptation and evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 12 figures, 2 appendices</p></details> |

Nonetheless, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba Selective State Space Model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through adaptive expert routing. In the first level, a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer partitions input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second level aggregates these outputs through a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement, enhances generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most widely used 3D medical imaging modalities and varying data qualities.

| **[Multi-Scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning for Continual Test-time Adaptation in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05937v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distribution shift is a common challenge in medical images obtained from different clinical centers, significantly hindering the deployment of pre-trained semantic segmentation models in real-world applications across multiple domains. Continual Test-Time Adaptation(CTTA) has emerged as a promising approach to address cross-domain shifts during continually evolving target domains. Most existing CTTA methods rely on incrementally updating model parameters, which inevitably suffer from error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, especially in long-term adaptation. Recent prompt-tuning-based works have shown potential to mitigate the two issues above by updating only visual prompts. While these approaches have demonstrated promising performance, several limitations remain:1)lacking multi-scale prompt diversity, 2)inadequate incorporation of instance-specific knowledge, and 3)risk of privacy leakage. To overcome these limitations, we propose Multi-scale Global-Instance Prompt Tuning(MGIPT), to enhance scale diversity of prompts and capture both global- and instance-level knowledge for robust CTTA. Specifically, MGIPT consists of an Adaptive-scale Instance Prompt(AIP) and a Multi-scale Global-level Prompt(MGP). AIP dynamically learns lightweight and instance-specific prompts to mitigate error accumulation with adaptive optimal-scale selection mechanism. MGP captures domain-level knowledge across different scales to ensure robust adaptation with anti-forgetting capabilities. These complementary components are combined through a weighted ensemble approach, enabling effective dual-level adaptation that integrates both global and local information. Extensive experiments on medical image segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our MGIPT outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving robust adaptation across continually changing target domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, BIBM2025 |

While recent image segmentation studies focus on segmentation mask alignment with ground-truth, the task of boundary detection remains understudied, especially in the low data regime. In this work, we present a lightweight discrete diffusion contour refinement pipeline for robust boundary detection in the low data regime. We use a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) architecture with self-attention layers as the core of our pipeline, and condition on a segmentation mask, iteratively denoising a sparse contour representation. We introduce multiple novel adaptations for improved low-data efficacy and inference efficiency, including using a simplified diffusion process, a customized model architecture, and minimal post processing to produce a dense, isolated contour given a dataset of size <500 training images. Our method outperforms several SOTA baselines on the medical imaging dataset KVASIR, is competitive on HAM10K and our custom wildfire dataset, Smoke, while improving inference framerate by 3.5X.</p></details> | <details><summary>CRV 2...</summary><p>CRV 2026, 8 pages, 6 figures</p></details> |

Unlike previous hybrid approaches that integrate Attention and Mamba modules in fixed proportions, our unified design flexibly combines their capabilities within a single cohesive architecture, eliminating the need for manual ratio tuning and improving encode capability. We develop two UAM variants to comprehensively evaluate the benefits of this unified structure. Building on this backbone, we further propose a multimodal UAM framework that jointly performs cell-level classification and image segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that UAM achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tasks on public benchmarks, surpassing leading image-based foundation models. It improves cell classification accuracy from 74\% to 78\% ($n$=349,882 cells), and tumor segmentation precision from 75\% to 80\% ($n$=406 patches).</p></details> |  |
| **[Revisiting the Evaluation of Deep Neural Networks for Pedestrian Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10308v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable pedestrian detection represents a crucial step towards automated driving systems. However, the current performance benchmarks exhibit weaknesses. The currently applied metrics for various subsets of a validation dataset prohibit a realistic performance evaluation of a DNN for pedestrian detection. As image segmentation supplies fine-grained information about a street scene, it can serve as a starting point to automatically distinguish between different types of errors during the evaluation of a pedestrian detector. In this work, eight different error categories for pedestrian detection are proposed and new metrics are proposed for performance comparison along these error categories. We use the new metrics to compare various backbones for a simplified version of the APD, and show a more fine-grained and robust way to compare models with each other especially in terms of safety-critical performance. We achieve SOTA on CityPersons-reasonable (without extra training data) by using a rather simple architecture.</p></details> |  |

In the deep learning approach, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs), especially UNet, are widely applied in medical image segmentation. However, it is difficult to deal with uncertainty due to the partial volume effect in brain images. To overcome this limitation, we propose an enhanced framework, named UNet with intuitionistic fuzzy logic (IF-UNet), which incorporates intuitionistic fuzzy logic into UNet. The model processes input data in terms of membership, nonmembership, and hesitation degrees, allowing it to better address tissue ambiguity resulting from partial volume effects and boundary uncertainties. The proposed architecture is evaluated on the Internet Brain Segmentation Repository (IBSR) dataset, and its performance is computed using accuracy, Dice coefficient, and intersection over union (IoU). Experimental results confirm that IF-UNet improves segmentation quality with handling uncertainty in brain images.</p></details> |  |

We present a cross-modal evaluation framework for materials image segmentation spanning SEM, AFM, XCT, and optical microscopy. Our evaluation of six encoder-decoder combinations across seven datasets reveals that optimal architectures vary systematically by context: UNet excels for high-contrast 2D imaging while DeepLabv3+ is preferred for the hardest cases. The framework also provides deployment feedback via out-of-distribution detection and counterfactual explanations that reveal which microstructural features drive predictions. Together, the architecture guidance, reliability signals, and interpretability tools address a practical gap in materials characterization, where researchers lack tools to select architectures for their specific imaging setup or assess when models can be trusted on new samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Admissibility of Stein Shrinkage for Batch Normalization in the Presence of Adversarial Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08261v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks, primarily used to improve stability and regularization during training. BN centers and scales feature maps using sample means and variances, which are naturally suited for Stein's shrinkage estimation. Applying such shrinkage yields more accurate mean and variance estimates of the batch in the mean-squared-error sense. In this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator of the mean and variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators, respectively, in the presence of adversarial attacks modeled using sub-Gaussian distributions. Furthermore, by construction, the James-Stein (JS) BN yields a smaller local Lipschitz constant compared to the vanilla BN, implying better regularity properties and potentially improved robustness. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and the use of it in image classification and segmentation tasks with and without adversarial attacks. We present SOTA performance results using this Stein-corrected BN in a standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data, and image segmentation using HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

However, there can be biases in AI models, particularly when they are trained using imbalanced training datasets. One such example has been the strong ethnicity bias effect in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation models. Although this phenomenon has been reported in a number of publications, little is known about the effectiveness of bias mitigation algorithms in this domain. We aim to investigate the impact of common bias mitigation methods to address bias between Black and White subjects in AI-based CMR segmentation models. Specifically, we use oversampling, importance reweighing and Group DRO as well as combinations of these techniques to mitigate the ethnicity bias. Second, motivated by recent findings on the root causes of AI-based CMR segmentation bias, we evaluate the same methods using models trained and evaluated on cropped CMR images. We find that bias can be mitigated using oversampling, significantly improving performance for the underrepresented Black subjects whilst not significantly reducing the majority White subjects' performance. Using cropped images increases performance for both ethnicities and reduces the bias, whilst adding oversampling as a bias mitigation technique with cropped images reduces the bias further. When testing the models on an external clinical validation set, we find high segmentation performance and no statistically significant bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Journal of Machine Learning for Biomedical Imaging (MELBA) https://melba-journal.org/2025:036</p></details> |

This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.</p></details> |  |

In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency.

However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Look Spatial Reasoning for Dense Surgical Instrument Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11024v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images.

| **[Are Dense Labels Always Necessary for 3D Object Detection from Point Cloud?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02818v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object detection methods often require a large amount of 3D bounding box annotations for training. However, collecting such large-scale densely-supervised datasets is notoriously costly. To reduce the cumbersome data annotation process, we propose a novel sparsely-annotated framework, in which we just annotate one 3D object per scene. Such a sparse annotation strategy could significantly reduce the heavy annotation burden, while inexact and incomplete sparse supervision may severely deteriorate the detection performance. To address this issue, we develop the SS3D++ method that alternatively improves 3D detector training and confident fully-annotated scene generation in a unified learning scheme. Using sparse annotations as seeds, we progressively generate confident fully-annotated scenes based on designing a missing-annotated instance mining module and reliable background mining module. Our proposed method produces competitive results when compared with SOTA weakly-supervised methods using the same or even more annotation costs. Besides, compared with SOTA fully-supervised methods, we achieve on-par or even better performance on the KITTI dataset with about 5x less annotation cost, and 90% of their performance on the Waymo dataset with about 15x less annotation cost. The additional unlabeled training scenes could further boost the performance.</p></details> | update |
| **[FGAA-FPN: Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for Oriented Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10710v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing and aerial imagery, oriented object detection has become a key capability for geographic information updating, maritime surveillance, and disaster response. However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The Visual Computer</p></details> |

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems.

In the transportation sector, object detection is widely used to improve security, for example, in traffic security and passenger crossings at train stations. Some accidents occur in the train crossing area at the station, like passengers uncarefully when passing through the yellow line. So further security needs to be developed. Additional technology is required to reduce the number of accidents. This paper focuses on passenger detection applications at train stations using YOLOX and Edge AI Accelerator hardware. the performance of the AI accelerator will be compared with Jetson Orin Nano.

| **[1%>100%: High-Efficiency Visual Adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10513v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying vision foundation models typically relies on efficient adaptation strategies, whereas conventional full fine-tuning suffers from prohibitive costs and low efficiency. While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models. We release the code on https://github.com/DongshuoYin/CoLin.</p></details> |  |

The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small.

| **[Learning to Detect Baked Goods with Limited Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09979v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monitoring leftover products provides valuable insights that can be used to optimize future production. This is especially important for German bakeries because freshly baked goods have a very short shelf life. Automating this process can reduce labor costs, improve accuracy, and streamline operations. We propose automating this process using an object detection model to identify baked goods from images. However, the large diversity of German baked goods makes fully supervised training prohibitively expensive and limits scalability. Although open-vocabulary detectors (e.g., OWLv2, Grounding DINO) offer lexibility, we demonstrate that they are insufficient for our task. While motivated by bakeries, our work addresses the broader challenges of deploying computer vision in industries, where tasks are specialized and annotated datasets are scarce. We compile dataset splits with varying supervision levels, covering 19 classes of baked goods. We propose two training workflows to train an object detection model with limited supervision. First, we combine OWLv2 and Grounding DINO localization with image-level supervision to train the model in a weakly supervised manner. Second, we improve viewpoint robustness by fine-tuning on video frames annotated using Segment Anything 2 as a pseudo-label propagation model. Using these workflows, we train YOLOv11 for our detection task due to its favorable speed accuracy tradeoff. Relying solely on image-level supervision, the model achieves a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.91. Finetuning with pseudo-labels raises model performance by 19.3% under non-ideal deployment conditions. Combining these workflows trains a model that surpasses our fully-supervised baseline model under non-ideal deployment conditions, despite relying only on image-level supervision.</p></details> |  |
| **[RAWDet-7: A Multi-Scenario Benchmark for Object Detection and Description on Quantized RAW Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03760v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most vision models are trained on RGB images processed through ISP pipelines optimized for human perception, which can discard sensor-level information useful for machine reasoning. RAW images preserve unprocessed scene data, enabling models to leverage richer cues for both object detection and object description, capturing fine-grained details, spatial relationships, and contextual information often lost in processed images. To support research in this domain, we introduce RAWDet-7, a large-scale dataset of ~25k training and 7.6k test RAW images collected across diverse cameras, lighting conditions, and environments, densely annotated for seven object categories following MS-COCO and LVIS conventions. In addition, we provide object-level descriptions derived from the corresponding high-resolution sRGB images, facilitating the study of object-level information preservation under RAW image processing and low-bit quantization. The dataset allows evaluation under simulated 4-bit, 6-bit, and 8-bit quantization, reflecting realistic sensor constraints, and provides a benchmark for studying detection performance, description quality & detail, and generalization in low-bit RAW image processing.

| **[BiSSL: Enhancing the Alignment Between Self-Supervised Pretraining and Downstream Fine-Tuning via Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02387v5)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Models initialized from self-supervised pretraining may suffer from poor alignment with downstream tasks, reducing the extent to which subsequent fine-tuning can adapt pretrained features toward downstream objectives. To mitigate this, we introduce BiSSL, a novel bilevel training framework that enhances the alignment of self-supervised pretrained models with downstream tasks prior to fine-tuning. BiSSL acts as an intermediate training stage conducted after conventional self-supervised pretraining and is tasked with solving a bilevel optimization problem that incorporates the pretext and downstream training objectives in its lower- and upper-level objectives, respectively. This approach explicitly models the interdependence between the pretraining and fine-tuning stages within the conventional self-supervised learning pipeline, facilitating enhanced information sharing between them that ultimately leads to a model initialization better aligned with the downstream task. We propose a general training algorithm for BiSSL that is compatible with a broad range of pretext and downstream tasks. Using SimCLR and Bootstrap Your Own Latent to pretrain ResNet-50 backbones on the ImageNet dataset, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly improves accuracy on the vast majority of 12 downstream image classification datasets, as well as on object detection. Exploratory analyses alongside investigative experiments further provide compelling evidence that BiSSL enhances downstream alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Energy-Efficient Fast Object Detection on Edge Devices for IoT Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09515v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an Internet of Things (IoT) application that utilizes an AI classifier for fast-object detection using the frame difference method. This method, with its shorter duration, is the most efficient and suitable for fast-object detection in IoT systems, which require energy-efficient applications compared to end-to-end methods. We have implemented this technique on three edge devices: AMD AlveoT M U50, Jetson Orin Nano, and Hailo-8T M AI Accelerator, and four models with artificial neural networks and transformer models. We examined various classes, including birds, cars, trains, and airplanes. Using the frame difference method, the MobileNet model consistently has high accuracy, low latency, and is highly energy-efficient. YOLOX consistently shows the lowest accuracy, lowest latency, and lowest efficiency. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has improved the average accuracy gain by 28.314%, the average efficiency gain by 3.6 times, and the average latency reduction by 39.305% compared to the end-to-end method. Of all these classes, the faster objects are trains and airplanes. Experiments show that the accuracy percentage for trains and airplanes is lower than other categories. So, in tasks that require fast detection and accurate results, end-to-end methods can be a disaster because they cannot handle fast object detection. To improve computational efficiency, we designed our proposed method as a lightweight detection algorithm. It is well suited for applications in IoT systems, especially those that require fast-moving object detection and higher accuracy.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose ALIGN (Advanced query initialization with LiDAR and Image GuidaNce), a novel approach for occlusion-robust, object-aware query initialization. Our model consists of three key components: (i) Occlusion-aware Center Estimation (OCE), which integrates LiDAR geometry and image semantics to estimate object centers accurately (ii) Adaptive Neighbor Sampling (ANS), which generates object candidates from LiDAR clustering and supplements each object by sampling spatially and semantically aligned points around it and (iii) Dynamic Query Balancing (DQB), which adaptively balances queries between foreground and background regions. Our extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that ALIGN consistently improves performance across multiple state-of-the-art detectors, achieving gains of up to +0.9 mAP and +1.2 NDS, particularly in challenging scenes with occlusions or dense crowds. Our code will be publicly available upon publication.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Practical Feasibility of Gradient Inversion Attacks in Federated Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19819v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient inversion attacks are often presented as a serious privacy threat in federated learning, with recent work reporting increasingly strong reconstructions under favorable experimental settings. However, it remains unclear whether such attacks are feasible in modern, performance-optimized systems deployed in practice. In this work, we evaluate the practical feasibility of gradient inversion for image-based federated learning. We conduct a systematic study across multiple datasets and tasks, including image classification and object detection, using canonical vision architectures at contemporary resolutions. Our results show that while gradient inversion remains possible for certain legacy or transitional designs under highly restrictive assumptions, modern, performance-optimized models consistently resist meaningful reconstruction visually. We further demonstrate that many reported successes rely on upper-bound settings, such as inference mode operation or architectural simplifications which do not reflect realistic training pipelines. Taken together, our findings indicate that, under an honest-but-curious server assumption, high-fidelity image reconstruction via gradient inversion does not constitute a critical privacy risk in production-optimized federated learning systems, and that practical risk assessments must carefully distinguish diagnostic attack settings from real-world deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: r...</summary><p>v2: revised manuscript; expanded experiments; improved analysis of reconstruction behavior across architectures</p></details> |

However, due to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents. Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically, it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the AP@0.5 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent collaborative perception.

However, these advancements come with significant demands for memory and computational resources, presenting challenges for hardware deployment. Heterogeneous compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising solution for enabling energy-efficient deployment of ViTs. Despite this potential, monolithic CIM-based designs face scalability issues due to the size limitations of a single chip. To address this challenge, emerging chiplet-based techniques offer a more scalable alternative. However, chiplet designs come with their own costs, as they introduce expensive communication, which can hinder improvements in throughput. This work introduces Hemlet, a heterogeneous CIM chiplet system designed to accelerate ViT workloads. Hemlet enables flexible resource scaling through the integration of heterogeneous analog CIM (ACIM), digital CIM (DCIM), and Intermediate Data Process (IDP) chiplets. To improve throughput while reducing communication overhead, it employs a group-level parallelism (GLP) mapping strategy and system-level dataflow optimization, achieving speedups ranging from 2.41x to 5.74x across various hardware configurations within the chiplet system. Our evaluation results show that Hemlet can reach a throughput of 9.56 TOPS with an energy efficiency of 4.98 TOPS/W.</p></details> |  |
| **[TSJNet: A Multi-modality Target and Semantic Awareness Joint-driven Image Fusion Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01212v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study aims to address the problem of incomplete information in unimodal images for semantic segmentation and object detection tasks. Existing multimodal fusion methods suffer from limited capability in discriminative modeling of multi-scale semantic structures and salient target regions, which further restricts the effective fusion of task-related semantic details and target information across modalities. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel fusion network termed TSJNet, which leverages the semantic information output by high-level tasks in a joint manner to guide the fusion process. Specifically, we design a multi-dimensional feature extraction module with dual parallel branches to capture multi-scale and salient features. Meanwhile, a data-agnostic spatial attention module embedded in the decoder dynamically calibrates attention allocation across different data domains, significantly enhancing the model's generalization ability. To optimize both fusion and advanced visual tasks, we balance performance by combining fusion loss with semantic losses. Additionally, we have developed a multimodal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) dataset covering multiple scenarios (UMS). Extensive experiments demonstrate that TSJNet achieves outstanding performance on five public datasets (MSRS, M\textsuperscript{3}FD, RoadScene, LLVIP, and TNO) and our UMS dataset. The generated fusion results exhibit favorable visual effects, and compared to state-of-the-art methods, the mean average precision (mAP@0.5) and mean intersection over union (mIoU) for object detection and segmentation, respectively, improve by 7.97\% and 10.88\%.The code and the dataset has been publicly released at https://github.com/XylonXu01/TSJNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mamba-based Spatio-Frequency Motion Perception for Video Camouflaged Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23601v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) methods primarily rely on spatial appearances for motion perception. However, the high foreground-background similarity in VCOD limits the discriminability of such features (e.g. color and texture). Recent studies demonstrate that frequency features can not only compensate for appearance limitations, but also perceive motion through dynamic variations in spectral energy. Meanwhile, the emerging state space model called Mamba enables efficient motion perception in frame sequences with its linear-time long-sequence modeling capability. Motivated by this, we propose Vcamba, a visual camouflage Mamba based on spatio-frequency motion perception that integrates frequency and spatial features for efficient and accurate VCOD. Specifically, by analyzing the spatial representations of frequency components, we reveal a structural evolution pattern that emerges from the ordered superposition of components. Based on this observation, we propose a unique frequency-domain sequential scanning (FSS) strategy to unfold the spectrum. Utilizing FSS, the adaptive frequency enhancement (AFE) module employs Mamba to model the causal dependencies within sequences, enabling effective frequency learning. Furthermore, we propose a space-based long-range motion perception (SLMP) module and a frequency-based long-range motion perception (FLMP) module to model spatio-temporal and frequency-temporal sequences. Finally, the space and frequency motion fusion module (SFMF) integrates dual-domain features into unified motion representation. Experiments show that Vcamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods across 6 evaluation metrics on 2 datasets with lower computation cost, confirming its superiority.

We introduce "ScatSpotter": a new dataset of images annotated with polygons around dog feces, collected to train and study object detection and segmentation systems for small potentially camouflaged outdoor waste. We gathered data in mostly urban environments, using "before/after/negative" (BAN) protocol: for a given location, we capture an image with the object present, an image from the same viewpoint after removal, and a nearby negative scene that often contains visually similar confusers. Image collection began in 2020. This paper focuses on two dataset checkpoints from 2025 and 2024. The dataset contains over 9000 images and 6000 polygon annotations. Of the author-captured images we held out 691 for validation and used the rest to train. Via community participation we obtained a 121-image test set that, while small, is independent from author-collected images and provides some generalization confidence across photographers, devices, and locations. Due to its limited size, we report both validation and test results. We explore the difficulty of the dataset using off-the-shelf VIT, MaskRCNN, YOLO-v9, and DINO-v2 models. Zero-shot DINO performs poorly, indicating limited foundational-model coverage of this category. Tuned DINO is the best model with a box-level average precision of 0.69 on a 691-image validation set and 0.7 on the test set. These results establish strong baselines and quantify the remaining difficulty of detecting small, camouflaged waste objects. To support open access to models and data, we compare centralized and decentralized distribution mechanisms and discuss trade-offs for sharing scientific data.

This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  |

They spread the fungal-type crayfish plague disease (Aphanomyces astaci) that is lethal to the native white clawed crayfish, the only native crayfish species in Britain. Invasive signal crayfish extensively burrow, causing habitat destruction, erosion of river banks and adverse changes in water quality, while also competing with native species for resources leading to declines in native populations. Moreover, pollution exacerbates the vulnerability of White-clawed crayfish, with their populations declining by over 90%. To safeguard aquatic ecosystems, it is imperative to address the challenges posed by invasive species and pollution in aquatic ecosystem's. This article introduces the Cognitive Edge Device (CED) computing platform for the detection of crayfish and plastic.

Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and 9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of 2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new state of the art on three benchmarks.

| **[Parameters as Experts: Adapting Vision Models with Dynamic Parameter Routing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06862v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adapting pre-trained vision models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) remains challenging, as it aims to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning using a minimal number of trainable parameters. When applied to complex dense prediction tasks, existing methods exhibit limitations, including input-agnostic modeling and redundant cross-layer representations. To this end, we propose AdaRoute, a new adapter-style method featuring a simple mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. Specifically, we introduce shared expert centers, where each expert is a trainable parameter matrix. During a feedforward pass, each AdaRoute module in the network dynamically generates weight matrices tailored for the current module via a simple dynamic parameter routing mechanism, which selectively aggregates parameter matrices in the corresponding expert center. Dynamic weight matrices in AdaRoute modules facilitate low-rank adaptation in an input-dependent manner, thus generating more customized and powerful feature representations. Moreover, since AdaRoute modules across multiple network layers share the same expert center, they improve feature diversity by promoting implicit cross-layer feature interaction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of AdaRoute on diverse vision tasks, including semantic segmentation, object detection and instance segmentation, and panoptic segmentation.

A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/SDU-VelKoTek/GenTrack2</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Vizing Chains: Improved Recourse in Dynamic Edge Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09497v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the maintenance of a $(Δ+C)$-edge-coloring ($C\ge 1$) in a fully dynamic graph $G$ with maximum degree $Δ$. We focus on minimizing \emph{recourse} which equals the number of recolored edges per edge updates. We present a new technique based on an object which we call a \emph{shift-tree}. This object tracks multiple possible recolorings of $G$ and enables us to maintain a proper coloring with small recourse in polynomial time. We shift colors over a path of edges, but unlike many other algorithms, we do not use \emph{fans} and \emph{alternating bicolored paths}. We combine the shift-tree with additional techniques to obtain an algorithm with a \emph{tight} recourse of $O\big( \frac{\log n}{\log \frac{Δ+C}{Δ-C}}\big)$ for all $C \ge 0.62Δ$ where $Δ-C = O(n^{1-δ})$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm to establish tight bounds for large palettes, and the first to do so when $Δ-C=o(Δ)$. This result settles the theoretical complexity of the recourse for large palettes. Furthermore, we believe that viewing the possible shifts as a tree can lead to similar tree-based techniques that extend to lower values of $C$, and to improved update times. A second application is to graphs with low arboricity $α$. Previous works [BCPS24, CRV24] achieve $O(ε^{-1}\log n)$ recourse per update with $C\ge (4+ε)α$, and we improve by achieving the same recourse while only requiring $C \ge (2+ε)α- 1$. This result is $Δ$-adaptive, i.e., it uses $Δ_t+C$ colors where $Δ_t$ is the current maximum degree. Trying to understand the limitations of our technique, and shift-based algorithms in general, we show a separation between the recourse achievable by algorithms that only shift colors along a path, and more general algorithms such as ones using the Nibbling Method [BGW21, BCPS24].</p></details> |  |

However, existing RMOT paradigms are largely designed for explicit instructions and consequently fail to generalize to complex instructions that require logical reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT), a novel task that requires models to identify and track targets that satisfy implicit constraints via logical reasoning. To advance this field, we construct the ReaMOT Challenge, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: (1) a large-scale dataset with 1,156 instructions categorized into High-Level Reasoning and Low-Level Perception, covering 423,359 image-language pairs across 869 diverse scenes; and (2) a tailored metric suite designed to jointly evaluate reasoning accuracy and tracking robustness. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework that synergizes the reasoning capabilities of Thinking-variant Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) with the precise temporal modeling of SAM2. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/chen-si-jia/ReaMOT</p></details> |
| **[GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08550v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

Specifically, changes in the scene background not only render traditional frame-to-frame object IoU association methods ineffective but also introduce significant view shifts in the objects, which complicates tracking. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel HomView-MOT framework, which for the first time, harnesses the view homography inherent in changing scenes to solve MOT challenges in moving environments, incorporating homographic matching and view-centric concepts. We introduce a Fast Homography Estimation (FHE) algorithm for rapid computation of homography matrices between video frames, enabling object View-Centric ID Learning (VCIL) and leveraging multi-view homography to learn cross-view ID features. Concurrently, our Homographic Matching Filter (HMF) maps object bounding boxes from different frames onto a common view plane for a more realistic physical IoU association. Extensive experiments have proven that these innovations allow HomView-MOT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent UAV MOT datasets VisDrone and UAVDT.</p></details> | TGRS 2026 |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a physical environment indirect prompt injection attack that exploits the multimodal language interpretation abilities of AI models. CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents: drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML).

| **[MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04692v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/chen-si-jia/DRMOT</p></details> |

However, most existing systems depend on pre-scanned, static environments and rely heavily on continuous tracking or marker-based solutions, which limit adaptability in dynamic physical spaces. This is particularly problematic for AR headsets and glasses, which typically follow the user's head movement and cannot maintain a fixed, stationary view of the scene. Moreover, continuous scene observation is neither power-efficient nor practical for wearable devices, given their limited battery and processing capabilities. A persistent challenge arises when multiple identical objects are present in the environment-standard object tracking pipelines often fail to maintain consistent identities without uninterrupted observation or external sensors. These limitations hinder fluid physical-virtual interactions, especially in dynamic or occluded scenes where continuous tracking is infeasible. To address this, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for re-identifying identical objects in AR scenes using only one partial egocentric observation frame captured by a headset. We formulate the problem as a label assignment task solved via integer programming, augmented with a Voronoi diagram-based pruning strategy to improve computational efficiency. This method reduces computation time by 50% while preserving 91% accuracy in simulated experiments. Moreover, we evaluated our approach in quantitative synthetic and quantitative real-world experiments. We also conducted three qualitative real-world experiments to demonstrate the practical utility and generalizability for enabling dynamic, markerless object interaction in AR environments.

The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 7 figures, conference paper published in IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference 2025</p></details> |

Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dictionary Learning under Symmetries via Group Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19557v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dictionary learning problem can be viewed as a data-driven process to learn a suitable transformation so that data is sparsely represented directly from example data. In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures |
| **[OptiPMB: Enhancing 3D Multi-Object Tracking with Optimized Poisson Multi-Bernoulli Filtering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12968v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is crucial for autonomous driving, as it enables robust perception, navigation, and planning in complex environments. While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAD-SLAM: Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM with Dynamic-Static Decoupled Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19420v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural radiation fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based SLAM have achieved impressive localization accuracy and high-quality dense mapping in static scenes. However, these methods remain challenged in dynamic environments, where moving objects violate the static-world assumption and introduce inconsistent observations that degrade both camera tracking and map reconstruction. This motivates two fundamental problems: robustly identifying dynamic objects and modeling them online. To address these limitations, we propose CAD-SLAM, a Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM framework with dynamic-static decoupled mapping. Our key insight is that dynamic objects inherently violate cross-view and cross-time scene consistency. We detect object motion by analyzing geometric and texture discrepancies between historical map renderings and real-world observations. Once a moving object is identified, we perform bidirectional dynamic object tracking (both backward and forward in time) to achieve complete sequence-wise dynamic recognition. Our consistency-aware dynamic detection model achieves category-agnostic, instantaneous dynamic identification, which effectively mitigates motion-induced interference during localization and mapping. In addition, we introduce a dynamic-static decoupled mapping strategy that employs a temporal Gaussian model for online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate the flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities of our method, along with the state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  |

These difficulties are further exacerbated by the geometric distortion and extreme scale variation introduced by static fisheye cameras. In this work, we present GTATrack, a hierarchical tracking framework that win first place in the SoccerTrack Challenge 2025. GTATrack integrates two core components: Deep Expansion IoU (Deep-EIoU) for motion-agnostic online association and Global Tracklet Association (GTA) for trajectory-level refinement. This two-stage design enables both robust short-term matching and long-term identity consistency. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is used to boost detector recall on small and distorted targets. The synergy between local association and global reasoning effectively addresses identity switches, occlusions, and tracking fragmentation.

While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, automation of the inspection task is a challenging problem as it requires precise navigation to capture images from optimal distances and viewing angles. This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. The detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image. These are associated with the power plant model and used to infer the UAV position relative to the inspected PV installation. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. Additionally, we present three different methods for visual segmentation of PV modules and evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline. The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of the power plant model precision on the localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 23 figures.

This paper presents an AI-enabled burn assessment and management platform that integrates multi-view photogrammetry, 3D surface reconstruction, and deep learning-based segmentation within a structured clinical workflow. Using standard multi-angle images from consumer-grade cameras, the system reconstructs patient-specific 3D burn surfaces and maps burn regions onto anatomy to compute objective metrics in real-world units, including surface area, TBSA, depth-related geometric proxies, and volumetric change. Successive reconstructions are spatially aligned to quantify healing progression over time, enabling objective tracking of wound contraction and depth reduction. The platform also supports structured patient intake, guided image capture, 3D analysis and visualization, treatment recommendations, and automated report generation. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates stable reconstructions, consistent metric computation, and clinically plausible longitudinal trends, supporting a scalable, non-invasive approach to objective, geometry-aware burn assessment and decision support in acute and outpatient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |

Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16M QA pairs over 270K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, with near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral). project page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |
| **[Molmo2: Open Weights and Data for Vision-Language Models with Video Understanding and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10611v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.</p></details> | 33 pages, 27figures |
| **[DeTracker: Motion-decoupled Vehicle Detection and Tracking in Unstabilized Satellite Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09240v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satellite videos provide continuous observations of surface dynamics but pose significant challenges for multi-object tracking (MOT), especially under unstabilized conditions where platform jitter and the weak appearance of tiny objects jointly degrade tracking performance. To address this problem, we propose DeTracker, a joint detection-and-tracking framework tailored for unstabilized satellite videos. DeTracker introduces a Global--Local Motion Decoupling (GLMD) module that explicitly separates satellite platform motion from true object motion through global alignment and local refinement, leading to improved trajectory stability and motion estimation accuracy. In addition, a Temporal Dependency Feature Pyramid (TDFP) module is developed to perform cross-frame temporal feature fusion, enhancing the continuity and discriminability of tiny-object representations. We further construct a new benchmark dataset, SDM-Car-SU, which simulates multi-directional and multi-speed platform motions to enable systematic evaluation of tracking robustness under varying motion perturbations. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real unstabilized satellite videos demonstrate that DeTracker significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 61.1% MOTA on SDM-Car-SU and 47.3% MOTA on real satellite video data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Reliable Spatiotemporal Dependencies for Efficient Visual Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09078v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in transformer-based lightweight object tracking have established new standards across benchmarks, leveraging the global receptive field and powerful feature extraction capabilities of attention mechanisms. Despite these achievements, existing methods universally employ sparse sampling during training--utilizing only one template and one search image per sequence--which fails to comprehensively explore spatiotemporal information in videos. This limitation constrains performance and cause the gap between lightweight and high-performance trackers. To bridge this divide while maintaining real-time efficiency, we propose STDTrack, a framework that pioneers the integration of reliable spatiotemporal dependencies into lightweight trackers. Our approach implements dense video sampling to maximize spatiotemporal information utilization. We introduce a temporally propagating spatiotemporal token to guide per-frame feature extraction. To ensure comprehensive target state representation, we disign the Multi-frame Information Fusion Module (MFIFM), which augments current dependencies using historical context. The MFIFM operates on features stored in our constructed Spatiotemporal Token Maintainer (STM), where a quality-based update mechanism ensures information reliability. Considering the scale variation among tracking targets, we develop a multi-scale prediction head to dynamically adapt to objects of different sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art results across six benchmarks. Notably, on GOT-10k, STDTrack rivals certain high-performance non-real-time trackers (e.g., MixFormer) while operating at 192 FPS(GPU) and 41 FPS(CPU).</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking.

It decouples understanding and generation via task-specific low-rank adapters, avoiding objective interference and representation entanglement, while a novel reference-based multimodal preference alignment optimizes relative outcomes under identical conditioning, improving faithfulness and controllability without large-scale retraining. UniDFlpw achieves SOTA performance across eight benchmarks and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to tasks including inpainting, in-context image generation, reference-based editing, and compositional generation, despite no explicit task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepGen 1.0: A Lightweight Unified Multimodal Model for Advancing Image Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12205v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current unified multimodal models for image generation and editing typically rely on massive parameter scales (e.g., >10B), entailing prohibitive training costs and deployment footprints. In this work, we present DeepGen 1.0, a lightweight 5B unified model that achieves comprehensive capabilities competitive with or surpassing much larger counterparts. To overcome the limitations of compact models in semantic understanding and fine-grained control, we introduce Stacked Channel Bridging (SCB), a deep alignment framework that extracts hierarchical features from multiple VLM layers and fuses them with learnable 'think tokens' to provide the generative backbone with structured, reasoning-rich guidance. We further design a data-centric training strategy spanning three progressive stages: (1) Alignment Pre-training on large-scale image-text pairs and editing triplets to synchronize VLM and DiT representations, (2) Joint Supervised Fine-tuning on a high-quality mixture of generation, editing, and reasoning tasks to foster omni-capabilities, and (3) Reinforcement Learning with MR-GRPO, which leverages a mixture of reward functions and supervision signals, resulting in substantial gains in generation quality and alignment with human preferences, while maintaining stable training progress and avoiding visual artifacts. Despite being trained on only ~50M samples, DeepGen 1.0 achieves leading performance across diverse benchmarks, surpassing the 80B HunyuanImage by 28% on WISE and the 27B Qwen-Image-Edit by 37% on UniREditBench. By open-sourcing our training code, weights, and datasets, we provide an efficient, high-performance alternative to democratize unified multimodal research.</p></details> |  |

While Supervised Fine-Tuning mimics expert demonstrations effectively, it cannot correct policy drift in unseen states. Preference optimization methods address this but require costly preference pairs or reward modeling. We propose Flow Matching Adversarial Imitation Learning (FAIL), which minimizes policy-expert divergence through adversarial training without explicit rewards or pairwise comparisons. We derive two algorithms: FAIL-PD exploits differentiable ODE solvers for low-variance pathwise gradients, while FAIL-PG provides a black-box alternative for discrete or computationally constrained settings. Fine-tuning FLUX with only 13,000 demonstrations from Nano Banana pro, FAIL achieves competitive performance on prompt following and aesthetic benchmarks. Furthermore, the framework generalizes effectively to discrete image and video generation, and functions as a robust regularizer to mitigate reward hacking in reward-based optimization. Code and data are available at https://github.com/HansPolo113/FAIL.</p></details> |  |

We generated 3,200 photorealistic images using four semantically neutral prompts. The analysis employed a rigorous pipeline combining hybrid color normalization, facial landmark masking, and perceptually uniform skin tone quantification using the Monk (MST), PERLA, and Fitzpatrick scales. Neutral prompts produced highly polarized defaults. Both models exhibited a strong "default white" bias (>96% of outputs). However, they diverged sharply on gender: Gemini favored female-presenting subjects, while GPT favored male-presenting subjects with lighter skin tones. This research provides a large-scale, comparative audit of state-of-the-art models using an illumination-aware colorimetric methodology, distinguishing aesthetic rendering from underlying pigmentation in synthetic imagery. The study demonstrates that neutral prompts function as diagnostic probes rather than neutral instructions. It offers a robust framework for auditing algorithmic visual culture and challenges the sociolinguistic assumption that unmarked language results in inclusive representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CSEval: A Framework for Evaluating Clinical Semantics in Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12004v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation has been increasingly applied in medical domains for various purposes such as data augmentation and education. Evaluating the quality and clinical reliability of these generated images is essential. However, existing methods mainly assess image realism or diversity, while failing to capture whether the generated images reflect the intended clinical semantics, such as anatomical location and pathology. In this study, we propose the Clinical Semantics Evaluator (CSEval), a framework that leverages language models to assess clinical semantic alignment between the generated images and their conditioning prompts. Our experiments show that CSEval identifies semantic inconsistencies overlooked by other metrics and correlates with expert judgment. CSEval provides a scalable and clinically meaningful complement to existing evaluation methods, supporting the safe adoption of generative models in healthcare.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches resort to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to enhance this capability. However, they either incur high computational costs through joint training or suffer from spatial information loss when relying solely on textual prompts. To alleviate these limitations, we propose a Spatial Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) framework, a plug-and-play approach that effectively bridges the reasoning capabilities of MLLMs with the generative power of diffusion models. Specifically, we first enhance the diffusion model's layout awareness by training it on an interleaved text-coordinate instruction format. We then leverage state-of-the-art MLLMs as planners to generate comprehensive layout plans, transferring their spatial planning capabilities directly to the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on image generation benchmarks and significantly outperforms baselines on complex reasoning tasks, while also showing strong efficacy in image editing scenarios.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |

In contrast, designers frequently draw inspiration from loosely connected visual references, seeking emergent connections that spark new ideas. We propose Inspiration Seeds, a generative framework that shifts image generation from final execution to exploratory ideation. Given two input images, our model produces diverse, visually coherent compositions that reveal latent relationships between inputs, without relying on user-specified text prompts. Our approach is feed-forward, trained on synthetic triplets of decomposed visual aspects derived entirely through visual means: we use CLIP Sparse Autoencoders to extract editing directions in CLIP latent space and isolate concept pairs. By removing the reliance on language and enabling fast, intuitive recombination, our method supports visual ideation at the early and ambiguous stages of creative work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page available at https://inspirationseedspaper.github.io/InspirationSeeds/</p></details> |

To address these limitations, we introduce ContextGen, a novel Diffusion Transformer framework for multi-instance generation that is guided by both layout and reference images. Our approach integrates two key technical contributions: a Contextual Layout Anchoring (CLA) mechanism that incorporates the composite layout image into the generation context to robustly anchor the objects in their desired positions, and Identity Consistency Attention (ICA), an innovative attention mechanism that leverages contextual reference images to ensure the identity consistency of multiple instances. To address the absence of a large-scale, high-quality dataset for this task, we introduce IMIG-100K, the first dataset to provide detailed layout and identity annotations specifically designed for Multi-Instance Generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ContextGen sets a new state-of-the-art, outperforming existing methods especially in layout control and identity fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://nenhang.github.io/ContextGen/</p></details> |

Recent multi-view diffusion models improve 3D-aware street view generation, but they struggle to produce place-aware and background-consistent urban scenes from text, BEV maps, and object bounding boxes. This limits their effectiveness in generating realistic samples for place recognition tasks. To address these challenges, we propose DiffPlace, a novel framework that introduces a place-ID controller to enable place-controllable multi-view image generation. The place-ID controller employs linear projection, perceiver transformer, and contrastive learning to map place-ID embeddings into a fixed CLIP space, allowing the model to synthesize images with consistent background buildings while flexibly modifying foreground objects and weather conditions. Extensive experiments, including quantitative comparisons and augmented training evaluations, demonstrate that DiffPlace outperforms existing methods in both generation quality and training support for visual place recognition. Our results highlight the potential of generative models in enhancing scene-level and place-aware synthesis, providing a valuable approach for improving place recognition in autonomous driving</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by ICRA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Multiscale Vector-Quantized Variational Autoencoder for Endoscopic Image Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19578v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gastrointestinal (GI) imaging via Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) generates a large number of images requiring manual screening. Deep learning-based Clinical Decision Support (CDS) systems can assist screening, yet their performance relies on the existence of large, diverse, training medical datasets. However, the scarcity of such data, due to privacy constraints and annotation costs, hinders CDS development. Generative machine learning offers a viable solution to combat this limitation. While current Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) methods, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Variational Autoencoders have been explored, they often face challenges with training stability and capturing sufficient visual diversity, especially when synthesizing abnormal findings. This work introduces a novel VAE-based methodology for medical image synthesis and presents its application for the generation of WCE images. The novel contributions of this work include a) multiscale extension of the Vector Quantized VAE model, named as Multiscale Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (MSVQ-VAE); b) unlike other VAE-based SDG models for WCE image generation, MSVQ-VAE is used to seamlessly introduce abnormalities into normal WCE images; c) it enables conditional generation of synthetic images, enabling the introduction of different types of abnormalities into the normal WCE images; d) it performs experiments with a variety of abnormality types, including polyps, vascular and inflammatory conditions. The utility of the generated images for CDS is assessed via image classification. Comparative experiments demonstrate that training a CDS classifier using the abnormal images generated by the proposed methodology yield comparable results with a classifier trained with only real data. The generality of the proposed methodology promises its applicability to various domains related to medical multimedia.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to diffusion models whose reverse time velocities can become stiff and implicitly allow unbounded propagation speed, Kac dynamics enforce finite speed transport and yield globally bounded kinetic energy. Building on this structure, we introduce classifier-free guidance in velocity space that preserves square integrability under mild conditions. We then propose endpoint only distillation that trains a student to match a frozen teacher over long intervals. We prove a stability result that promotes supervision at the endpoints to closeness along the entire path. Experiments demonstrate DistillKac delivers high quality samples with very few function evaluations while retaining the numerical stability benefits of finite speed probability flows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively. Our framework sets a new state-of-the-art multi-preference alignment recipe across modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Shallow Diffuse: Robust and Invisible Watermarking through Low-Dimensional Subspaces in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21088v5)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of AI-generated content from diffusion models has raised significant concerns regarding misinformation and copyright infringement. Watermarking is a crucial technique for identifying these AI-generated images and preventing their misuse. In this paper, we introduce Shallow Diffuse, a new watermarking technique that embeds robust and invisible watermarks into diffusion model outputs. Unlike existing approaches that integrate watermarking throughout the entire diffusion sampling process, Shallow Diffuse decouples these steps by leveraging the presence of a low-dimensional subspace in the image generation process. This method ensures that a substantial portion of the watermark lies in the null space of this subspace, effectively separating it from the image generation process. Our theoretical and empirical analyses show that this decoupling strategy greatly enhances the consistency of data generation and the detectability of the watermark. Extensive experiments further validate that our Shallow Diffuse outperforms existing watermarking methods in terms of robustness and consistency.

They discard information during image encoding, require a separately trained decoder, and model an auxiliary distribution to the raw data. In this paper, we propose Latent Forcing, a simple modification to existing architectures that achieves the efficiency of latent diffusion while operating on raw natural images. Our approach orders the denoising trajectory by jointly processing latents and pixels with separately tuned noise schedules. This allows the latents to act as a scratchpad for intermediate computation before high-frequency pixel features are generated. We find that the order of conditioning signals is critical, and we analyze this to explain differences between REPA distillation in the tokenizer and the diffusion model, conditional versus unconditional generation, and how tokenizer reconstruction quality relates to diffusability. Applied to ImageNet, Latent Forcing achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion transformer-based pixel generation at our compute scale.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |
| **[FastFlow: Accelerating The Generative Flow Matching Models with Bandit Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11105v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flow-matching models deliver state-of-the-art fidelity in image and video generation, but the inherent sequential denoising process renders them slower. Existing acceleration methods like distillation, trajectory truncation, and consistency approaches are static, require retraining, and often fail to generalize across tasks. We propose FastFlow, a plug-and-play adaptive inference framework that accelerates generation in flow matching models. FastFlow identifies denoising steps that produce only minor adjustments to the denoising path and approximates them without using the full neural network models used for velocity predictions. The approximation utilizes finite-difference velocity estimates from prior predictions to efficiently extrapolate future states, enabling faster advancements along the denoising path at zero compute cost. This enables skipping computation at intermediary steps. We model the decision of how many steps to safely skip before requiring a full model computation as a multi-armed bandit problem. The bandit learns the optimal skips to balance speed with performance. FastFlow integrates seamlessly with existing pipelines and generalizes across image generation, video generation, and editing tasks. Experiments demonstrate a speedup of over 2.6x while maintaining high-quality outputs.

However, these approaches often lack the interpretable connections between the generated and real images and can create anatomically implausible structures or illusions. To address these limitations, we propose the Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), a novel diffusion-based generative model that emphasises morphological transformation through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. DRDM introduces a topology-preserving deformation field generation strategy, which randomly samples and integrates multi-scale Deformation Velocity Fields (DVFs). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unrealistic deformation components, thus restoring randomly deformed images to a realistic distribution. This formulation enables the generation of diverse yet anatomically plausible deformations that preserve structural integrity, thereby improving data augmentation and synthesis for downstream tasks such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experiments on cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging and pulmonary Computed Tomography show that DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large-scale deformations, while maintaining anatomical plausibility of deformation fields. Additional evaluations on 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration tasks indicate notable performance gains, underscoring DRDM's potential to enhance both image manipulation and generative modelling in medical imaging applications.

| **[GLASS Flows: Transition Sampling for Alignment of Flow and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25170v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of flow matching and diffusion models can be greatly improved at inference time using reward alignment algorithms, yet efficiency remains a major limitation. While several algorithms were proposed, we demonstrate that a common bottleneck is the sampling method these algorithms rely on: many algorithms require to sample Markov transitions via SDE sampling, which is significantly less efficient and often less performant than ODE sampling. To remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that simulates a "flow matching model within a flow matching model" to sample Markov transitions. As we show in this work, this "inner" flow matching model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency. Combined with Feynman-Kac Steering, GLASS Flows improve state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, making it a simple, drop-in solution for inference-time scaling of flow and diffusion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Localized Control in Diffusion Models via Latent Vector Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01991v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models emerged as a leading approach in text-to-image generation, producing high-quality images from textual descriptions. However, attempting to achieve detailed control to get a desired image solely through text remains a laborious trial-and-error endeavor. Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively synthesizes high-quality images with controlled local conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SnapGen++: Unleashing Diffusion Transformers for Efficient High-Fidelity Image Generation on Edge Devices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08303v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs) have set new standards in image generation, yet remain impractical for on-device deployment due to their high computational and memory costs. In this work, we present an efficient DiT framework tailored for mobile and edge devices that achieves transformer-level generation quality under strict resource constraints. Our design combines three key components. First, we propose a compact DiT architecture with an adaptive global-local sparse attention mechanism that balances global context modeling and local detail preservation. Second, we propose an elastic training framework that jointly optimizes sub-DiTs of varying capacities within a unified supernetwork, allowing a single model to dynamically adjust for efficient inference across different hardware. Finally, we develop Knowledge-Guided Distribution Matching Distillation, a step-distillation pipeline that integrates the DMD objective with knowledge transfer from few-step teacher models, producing high-fidelity and low-latency generation (e.g., 4-step) suitable for real-time on-device use. Together, these contributions enable scalable, efficient, and high-quality diffusion models for deployment on diverse hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://snap-research.github.io/snapgenplusplus/</p></details> |
| **[Predicting integers from continuous parameters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10751v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of predicting numeric labels that are constrained to the integers or to a subrange of the integers. For example, the number of up-votes on social media posts, or the number of bicycles available at a public rental station. While it is possible to model these as continuous values, and to apply traditional regression, this approach changes the underlying distribution on the labels from discrete to continuous. Discrete distributions have certain benefits, which leads us to the question whether such integer labels can be modeled directly by a discrete distribution, whose parameters are predicted from the features of a given instance. Moreover, we focus on the use case of output distributions of neural networks, which adds the requirement that the parameters of the distribution be continuous so that backpropagation and gradient descent may be used to learn the weights of the network. We investigate several options for such distributions, some existing and some novel, and test them on a range of tasks, including tabular learning, sequential prediction and image generation. We find that overall the best performance comes from two distributions: Bitwise, which represents the target integer in bits and places a Bernoulli distribution on each, and a discrete analogue of the Laplace distribution, which uses a distribution with exponentially decaying tails around a continuous mean.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Diffusion-Based Generative Prior Approach to Sparse-view Computed Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10722v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of X-rays CT images from sparse or limited-angle geometries is a highly challenging task. The lack of data typically results in artifacts in the reconstructed image and may even lead to object distortions. For this reason, the use of deep generative models in this context has great interest and potential success. In the Deep Generative Prior (DGP) framework, the use of diffusion-based generative models is combined with an iterative optimization algorithm for the reconstruction of CT images from sinograms acquired under sparse geometries, to maintain the explainability of a model-based approach while introducing the generative power of a neural network. There are therefore several aspects that can be further investigated within these frameworks to improve reconstruction quality, such as image generation, the model, and the iterative algorithm used to solve the minimization problem, for which we propose modifications with respect to existing approaches. The results obtained even under highly sparse geometries are very promising, although further research is clearly needed in this direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Frequency Modulation for Controllable Text-driven Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10662v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of text-guided diffusion models has established a new image generation paradigm driven by the iterative refinement of text prompts. However, modifying the original text prompt to achieve the expected semantic adjustments often results in unintended global structure changes that disrupt user intent. Existing methods rely on empirical feature map selection for intervention, whose performance heavily depends on appropriate selection, leading to suboptimal stability. This paper tries to solve the aforementioned problem from a frequency perspective and analyzes the impact of the frequency spectrum of noisy latent variables on the hierarchical emergence of the structure framework and fine-grained textures during the generation process. We find that lower-frequency components are primarily responsible for establishing the structure framework in the early generation stage. Their influence diminishes over time, giving way to higher-frequency components that synthesize fine-grained textures. In light of this, we propose a training-free frequency modulation method utilizing a frequency-dependent weighting function with dynamic decay. This method maintains the structure framework consistency while permitting targeted semantic modifications. By directly manipulating the noisy latent variable, the proposed method avoids the empirical selection of internal feature maps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, achieving an effective balance between preserving structure and enabling semantic updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[MindPilot: Closed-loop Visual Stimulation Optimization for Brain Modulation with EEG-guided Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10552v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Whereas most brain-computer interface research has focused on decoding neural signals into behavior or intent, the reverse challenge-using controlled stimuli to steer brain activity-remains far less understood, particularly in the visual domain. However, designing images that consistently elicit desired neural responses is difficult: subjective states lack clear quantitative measures, and EEG feedback is both noisy and non-differentiable. We introduce MindPilot, the first closed-loop framework that uses EEG signals as optimization feedback to guide naturalistic image generation. Unlike prior work limited to invasive settings or low-level flicker stimuli, MindPilot leverages non-invasive EEG with natural images, treating the brain as a black-box function and employing a pseudo-model guidance mechanism to iteratively refine images without requiring explicit rewards or gradients. We validate MindPilot in both simulation and human experiments, demonstrating (i) efficient retrieval of semantic targets, (ii) closed-loop optimization of EEG features, and (iii) human-subject validations in mental matching and emotion regulation tasks. Our results establish the feasibility of EEG-guided image synthesis and open new avenues for non-invasive closed-loop brain modulation, bidirectional brain-computer interfaces, and neural signal-guided generative modeling.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[RealHD: A High-Quality Dataset for Robust Detection of State-of-the-Art AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10546v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of generative AI has raised concerns about the authenticity of digital images, as highly realistic fake images can now be generated at low cost, potentially increasing societal risks. In response, several datasets have been established to train detection models aimed at distinguishing AI-generated images from real ones. However, existing datasets suffer from limited generalization, low image quality, overly simple prompts, and insufficient image diversity. To address these limitations, we propose a high-quality, large-scale dataset comprising over 730,000 images across multiple categories, including both real and AI-generated images. The generated images are synthesized via state-of-the-art methods, including text-to-image generation (guided by over 10,000 carefully designed prompts), image inpainting, image refinement, and face swapping. Each generated image is annotated with its generation method and category. Inpainting images further include binary masks to indicate inpainted regions, providing rich metadata for analysis. Compared to existing datasets, detection models trained on our dataset demonstrate superior generalization capabilities. Our dataset not only serves as a strong benchmark for evaluating detection methods but also contributes to advancing the robustness of AI-generated image detection techniques. Building upon this, we propose a lightweight detection method based on image noise entropy, which transforms the original image into an entropy tensor of Non-Local Means (NLM) noise before classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on our dataset achieve strong generalization, and our method delivers competitive performance, establishing a solid baseline for future research. The dataset and source code are publicly available at https://real-hd.github.io.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of the 33rd ACM International Conference on Multimedia (ACM MM 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Biologically Plausible Learning via Bidirectional Spike-Based Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20284v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing biologically plausible learning algorithms that can achieve performance comparable to error backpropagation remains a longstanding challenge. Existing approaches often compromise biological plausibility by entirely avoiding the use of spikes for error propagation or relying on both positive and negative learning signals, while the question of how spikes can represent negative values remains unresolved. To address these limitations, we introduce Bidirectional Spike-based Distillation (BSD), a novel learning algorithm that jointly trains a feedforward and a backward spiking network. We formulate learning as a transformation between two spiking representations (i.e., stimulus encoding and concept encoding) so that the feedforward network implements perception and decision-making by mapping stimuli to actions, while the backward network supports memory recall by reconstructing stimuli from concept representations. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks, including image recognition, image generation, and sequential regression, show that BSD achieves performance comparable to networks trained with classical error backpropagation. These findings represent a significant step toward biologically grounded, spike-driven learning in neural networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/alden199/Bidirectional-Spike-Based-Distillation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Flow Matching with Uncertainty Quantification and Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10326v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success of sampling-based generative models such as flow matching, they can still produce samples of inconsistent or degraded quality. To assess sample reliability and generate higher-quality outputs, we propose uncertainty-aware flow matching (UA-Flow), a lightweight extension of flow matching that predicts the velocity field together with heteroscedastic uncertainty. UA-Flow estimates per-sample uncertainty by propagating velocity uncertainty through the flow dynamics. These uncertainty estimates act as a reliability signal for individual samples, and we further use them to steer generation via uncertainty-aware classifier guidance and classifier-free guidance. Experiments on image generation show that UA-Flow produces uncertainty signals more highly correlated with sample fidelity than baseline methods, and that uncertainty-guided sampling further improves generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[WildCat: Near-Linear Attention in Theory and Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10056v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce WildCat, a high-accuracy, low-cost approach to compressing the attention mechanism in neural networks. While attention is a staple of modern network architectures, it is also notoriously expensive to deploy due to resource requirements that scale quadratically with the input sequence length $n$. WildCat avoids these quadratic costs by only attending over a small weighted coreset. Crucially, we select the coreset using a fast but spectrally-accurate subsampling algorithm -- randomly pivoted Cholesky -- and weight the elements optimally to minimise reconstruction error. Remarkably, given bounded inputs, WildCat approximates exact attention with super-polynomial $O(n^{-\sqrt{\log(\log(n))}})$ error decay while running in near-linear $O(n^{1+o(1)})$ time. In contrast, prior practical approximations either lack error guarantees or require quadratic runtime to guarantee such high fidelity. We couple this advance with a GPU-optimized PyTorch implementation and a suite of benchmark experiments demonstrating the benefits of WildCat for image generation, image classification, and language model KV cache compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[GEBench: Benchmarking Image Generation Models as GUI Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09007v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in image generation models have enabled the prediction of future Graphical User Interface (GUI) states based on user instructions. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on general domain visual fidelity, leaving the evaluation of state transitions and temporal coherence in GUI-specific contexts underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce GEBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating dynamic interaction and temporal coherence in GUI generation. GEBench comprises 700 carefully curated samples spanning five task categories, covering both single-step interactions and multi-step trajectories across real-world and fictional scenarios, as well as grounding point localization. To support systematic evaluation, we propose GE-Score, a novel five-dimensional metric that assesses Goal Achievement, Interaction Logic, Content Consistency, UI Plausibility, and Visual Quality. Extensive evaluations on current models indicate that while they perform well on single-step transitions, they struggle significantly with maintaining temporal coherence and spatial grounding over longer interaction sequences. Our findings identify icon interpretation, text rendering, and localization precision as critical bottlenecks. This work provides a foundation for systematic assessment and suggests promising directions for future research toward building high-fidelity generative GUI environments.

| **[SciFlow-Bench: Evaluating Structure-Aware Scientific Diagram Generation via Inverse Parsing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09809v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientific diagrams convey explicit structural information, yet modern text-to-image models often produce visually plausible but structurally incorrect results. Existing benchmarks either rely on image-centric or subjective metrics insensitive to structure, or evaluate intermediate symbolic representations rather than final rendered images, leaving pixel-based diagram generation underexplored. We introduce SciFlow-Bench, a structure-first benchmark for evaluating scientific diagram generation directly from pixel-level outputs. Built from real scientific PDFs, SciFlow-Bench pairs each source framework figure with a canonical ground-truth graph and evaluates models as black-box image generators under a closed-loop, round-trip protocol that inverse-parses generated diagram images back into structured graphs for comparison. This design enforces evaluation by structural recoverability rather than visual similarity alone, and is enabled by a hierarchical multi-agent system that coordinates planning, perception, and structural reasoning. Experiments show that preserving structural correctness remains a fundamental challenge, particularly for diagrams with complex topology, underscoring the need for structure-aware evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MILR: Improving Multimodal Image Generation via Test-Time Latent Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22761v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance in various domains, including image generation. However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages,14 figures,9 tables</p></details> |
