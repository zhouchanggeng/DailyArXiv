| **[Minimal Clips, Maximum Salience: Long Video Summarization via Key Moment Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11399v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are able to process increasingly longer videos. Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clip-and-Verify: Linear Constraint-Driven Domain Clipping for Accelerating Neural Network Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11087v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art neural network (NN) verifiers demonstrate that applying the branch-and-bound (BaB) procedure with fast bounding techniques plays a key role in tackling many challenging verification properties. In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Clip-and-Verify is part of the $α,β$-CROWN verifier (http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2025 winner.

| **[CAPE: A CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble of Complementary Heatmap Cues for Embodied Reference Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21888v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address Embodied Reference Understanding, the task of predicting the object a person in the scene refers to through pointing gesture and language. This requires multimodal reasoning over text, visual pointing cues, and scene context, yet existing methods often fail to fully exploit visual disambiguation signals. We also observe that while the referent often aligns with the head-to-fingertip direction, in many cases it aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip direction, making a single-line assumption overly limiting. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To fuse their complementary strengths, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble guided by CLIP features. We further incorporate an auxiliary object center prediction head to enhance referent localization. We validate our approach on YouRefIt, achieving 75.0 mAP at 0.25 IoU, alongside state-of-the-art CLIP and C_D scores, and demonstrate its generality on unseen CAESAR and ISL Pointing, showing robust performance across benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[Decoupling Template Bias in CLIP: Harnessing Empty Prompts for Enhanced Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08606v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model excels in few-shot learning by aligning visual and textual representations. Our study shows that template-sample similarity (TSS), defined as the resemblance between a text template and an image sample, introduces bias. This bias leads the model to rely on template proximity rather than true sample-to-category alignment, reducing both accuracy and robustness in classification. We present a framework that uses empty prompts, textual inputs that convey the idea of "emptiness" without category information. These prompts capture unbiased template features and offset TSS bias. The framework employs two stages. During pre-training, empty prompts reveal and reduce template-induced bias within the CLIP encoder. During few-shot fine-tuning, a bias calibration loss enforces correct alignment between images and their categories, ensuring the model focuses on relevant visual cues. Experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our template correction method significantly reduces performance fluctuations caused by TSS, yielding higher classification accuracy and stronger robustness. The repository of this project is available at https://github.com/zhenyuZ-HUST/Decoupling-Template-Bias-in-CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI2026, poster)</p></details> |
| **[Towards Effective and Efficient Long Video Understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models via One-shot Clip Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08410v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to excessive memory overhead, most Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can only process videos of limited frames. In this paper, we propose an effective and efficient paradigm to remedy this shortcoming, termed One-shot video-Clip based Retrieval AuGmentation (OneClip-RAG). Compared with existing video RAG methods, OneClip-RAG makes full use of the merits of video clips for augmented video understanding in terms of both knowledge integrity and semantic coherence. Besides, it is also equipped with a novel query-guided video chunking algorithm that can unify clip chunking and cross-modal retrieval in one processing step, avoiding redundant computations. To improve instruction following, we further propose a new dataset called SynLongVideo and design a progressive training regime for OneClip-RAG. OneClip-RAG is plugged into five recent MLLMs and validated on a set of long-video benchmarks. Experimental results not only show the obvious performance gains by OneClip-RAG over MLLMs, e.g., boosting InternLV2 8B and Qwen2-VL 7B to the level of GPT-4o on MLVU, but also show its superior efficiency in handling long videos. e.g., enabling LLaVA-Video understand up to an hour of videos in less than 2.2 minutes on a single 4090 GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[DIST-CLIP: Arbitrary Metadata and Image Guided MRI Harmonization via Disentangled Anatomy-Contrast Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07674v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning holds immense promise for transforming medical image analysis, yet its clinical generalization remains profoundly limited. A major barrier is data heterogeneity. This is particularly true in Magnetic Resonance Imaging, where scanner hardware differences, diverse acquisition protocols, and varying sequence parameters introduce substantial domain shifts that obscure underlying biological signals. Data harmonization methods aim to reduce these instrumental and acquisition variability, but existing approaches remain insufficient. When applied to imaging data, image-based harmonization approaches are often restricted by the need for target images, while existing text-guided methods rely on simplistic labels that fail to capture complex acquisition details or are typically restricted to datasets with limited variability, failing to capture the heterogeneity of real-world clinical environments. To address these limitations, we propose DIST-CLIP (Disentangled Style Transfer with CLIP Guidance), a unified framework for MRI harmonization that flexibly uses either target images or DICOM metadata for guidance. Our framework explicitly disentangles anatomical content from image contrast, with the contrast representations being extracted using pre-trained CLIP encoders. These contrast embeddings are then integrated into the anatomical content via a novel Adaptive Style Transfer module. We trained and evaluated DIST-CLIP on diverse real-world clinical datasets, and showed significant improvements in performance when compared against state-of-the-art methods in both style translation fidelity and anatomical preservation, offering a flexible solution for style transfer and standardizing MRI data. Our code and weights will be made publicly available upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[MulCLIP: A Multi-level Alignment Framework for Enhancing Fine-grained Long-context CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07128v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models like CLIP show impressive ability to align images and text, but their training on short, concise captions makes them struggle with lengthy, detailed descriptions. Recent advances mitigate this challenge by leveraging region-proposal information to map visual regions with corresponding sentences from lengthy captions, yet incurring notable deployment costs. We introduce MulCLIP, a novel end-to-end multi-level alignment framework that bridges natural long-text structures with image components. MulCLIP first preserves global contrastive alignment between images and both summary and long captions, while extending positional embeddings for longer text sequences. To further enhance fine-grained understanding, we propose two novel strategies: (1) a token reconstruction alignment over locally calibrated features to strengthen semantic connections between words and image patches, and (2) a subcaption-aggregated patch alignment that automatically extracts and aggregates context-rich patches for each subcaption. Experimental results across diverse benchmarks demonstrate our method consistently improves downstream performance, while ablation studies confirm its multi-scale alignment is the key factor driving better fine-grained capability than region-proposal-assisted approaches, making it particularly suitable for diverse real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-UP: CLIP-Based Unanswerable Problem Detection for Visual Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01371v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in visual understanding and reasoning, such as in Visual Question Answering (VQA), where the model is asked a question related to a visual input. Still, these models can make distinctly unnatural errors, for example, providing (wrong) answers to unanswerable VQA questions, such as questions asking about objects that do not appear in the image. To address this issue, we propose CLIP-UP: CLIP-based Unanswerable Problem detection, a novel lightweight method for equipping VLMs with the ability to withhold answers to unanswerable questions. CLIP-UP leverages CLIP-based similarity measures to extract question-image alignment information to detect unanswerability, requiring efficient training of only a few additional layers, while keeping the original VLMs' weights unchanged. Tested across several models, CLIP-UP achieves significant improvements on benchmarks assessing unanswerability in both multiple-choice and open-ended VQA, surpassing other methods, while preserving original performance on other tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised version.

| **[Entropy Ratio Clipping as a Soft Global Constraint for Stable Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05591v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model post-training relies on reinforcement learning to improve model capability and alignment quality. However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions. We integrate ERC into both DAPO and GPPO reinforcement learning algorithms. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that ERC consistently improves performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[How (Mis)calibrated is Your Federated CLIP and What To Do About It?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04305v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While vision-language models like CLIP have been extensively studied, their calibration, crucial for reliable predictions, has received limited attention. Although a few prior works have examined CLIP calibration in offline settings, the impact of fine-tuning CLIP in a federated learning (FL) setup remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate how FL affects CLIP calibration and propose strategies to improve reliability in this distributed setting. We first analyze Textual Prompt Tuning approaches and show that they degrade calibration metrics when operating under FL. We also evaluate existing in-training calibration techniques across four global aggregation methods, finding that they provide limited improvements. Our results suggest that the key challenge lies not only in how we aggregate or calibrate, but in which components we choose to fine-tune. Motivated by this insight, we propose $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$, a straightforward LoRA-based approach that naturally improves calibration in FL, and we analyze the factors behind its effectiveness. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that $\text{FL}^2\text{oRA}$ consistently produces well-calibrated models, reducing the need for explicit calibration procedures. Codes are available at https://github.com/mainaksingha01/FL2oRA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sliced Rényi Pufferfish Privacy: Directional Additive Noise Mechanism and Private Learning with Gradient Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01115v2)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study privatization mechanism design and privacy accounting in the Pufferfish family, addressing two practical gaps of Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (RPP): high-dimensional optimal transport (OT) calibration and the absence of a general, mechanism-agnostic composition rule for iterative learning. We introduce Sliced Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (SRPP), which replaces high-dimensional comparisons by directional ones over a set of unit vectors, enabling geometry-aware and tractable guarantees. To calibrate noise without high-dimensional OT, we propose sliced Wasserstein mechanisms that compute per-direction (1-D) sensitivities, yielding closed-form, statistically stable, and anisotropic calibrations. We further define SRPP Envelope (SRPE) as computable upper bounds that are tightly implementable by these sliced Wasserstein mechanisms. For iterative deep learning algorithms, we develop a decompose-then-compose SRPP-SGD scheme with gradient clipping based on a History-Uniform Cap (HUC), a pathwise bound on one-step directional changes that is uniform over optimization history, and a mean-square variant (ms-HUC) that leverages subsampling randomness to obtain on-average SRPP guarantees with improved utility. The resulting HUC and ms-HUC accountants aggregate per-iteration, per-direction Renyi costs and integrate naturally with moments-accountant style analyses. Finally, when multiple mechanisms are trained and privatized independently under a common slicing geometry, our analysis yields graceful additive composition in both worst-case and mean-square regimes. Our experiments indicate that the proposed SRPP-based methods achieve favorable privacy-utility trade-offs in both static and iterative settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SSR: Semantic and Spatial Rectification for CLIP-based Weakly Supervised Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01701v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely applied to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-RL: Aligning Language and Policy Representations for Task Transfer in Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01616v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there has been an increasing need to develop agents capable of solving multiple tasks within the same environment, especially when these tasks are naturally associated with language. In this work, we propose a novel approach that leverages combinations of pre-trained (language, policy) pairs to establish an efficient transfer pipeline. Our algorithm is inspired by the principles of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) in Computer Vision, which aligns representations across different modalities under the philosophy that ''two modalities representing the same concept should have similar representations.'' The central idea here is that the instruction and corresponding policy of a task represent the same concept, the task itself, in two different modalities. Therefore, by extending the idea of CLIP to RL, our method creates a unified representation space for natural language and policy embeddings. Experimental results demonstrate the utility of our algorithm in achieving faster transfer across tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, accepted as a extended abstract at RLDM 2025</p></details> |
| **[Interpreting ResNet-based CLIP via Neuron-Attention Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19943v3)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel technique for interpreting the neurons in CLIP-ResNet by decomposing their contributions to the output into individual computation paths. More specifically, we analyze all pairwise combinations of neurons and the following attention heads of CLIP's attention-pooling layer. We find that these neuron-head pairs can be approximated by a single direction in CLIP-ResNet's image-text embedding space. Leveraging this insight, we interpret each neuron-head pair by associating it with text. Additionally, we find that only a sparse set of the neuron-head pairs have a significant contribution to the output value, and that some neuron-head pairs, while polysemantic, represent sub-concepts of their corresponding neurons. We use these observations for two applications. First, we employ the pairs for training-free semantic segmentation, outperforming previous methods for CLIP-ResNet. Second, we utilize the contributions of neuron-head pairs to monitor dataset distribution shifts. Our results demonstrate that examining individual computation paths in neural networks uncovers interpretable units, and that such units can be utilized for downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Mechanistic Interpretability.

| **[CLIP-Free, Label-Free, Zero-Shot Concept Bottleneck Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10981v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) map dense, high-dimensional feature representations into a set of human-interpretable concepts which are then combined linearly to make a prediction. However, modern CBMs rely on the CLIP model to establish a mapping from dense feature representations to textual concepts, and it remains unclear how to design CBMs for models other than CLIP. Methods that do not use CLIP instead require manual, labor intensive annotation to associate feature representations with concepts. Furthermore, all CBMs necessitate training a linear classifier to map the extracted concepts to class labels. In this work, we lift all three limitations simultaneously by proposing a method that converts any frozen visual classifier into a CBM without requiring image-concept labels (label-free), without relying on the CLIP model (CLIP-free), and by deriving the linear classifier in a zero-shot manner. Our method is formulated by aligning the original classifier's distribution (over discrete class indices) with its corresponding vision-language counterpart distribution derived from textual class names, while preserving the classifier's performance. The approach requires no ground-truth image-class annotations, and is highly data-efficient and preserves the classifier's reasoning process. Applied and tested on over 40 visual classifiers, our resulting CLIP-free, zero-shot CBM sets a new state of the art, surpassing even supervised CLIP-based CBMs. Finally, we also show that our method can be used for zero-shot image captioning, outperforming existing methods based on CLIP, and achieving state of the art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infrared and Visible Image Fusion with Language-Driven Loss in CLIP Embedding Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16267v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) has attracted much attention owing to the highly-complementary properties of the two image modalities. Due to the lack of ground-truth fused images, the fusion output of current deep-learning based methods heavily depends on the loss functions defined mathematically. As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors representing the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques.

| **[See, Rank, and Filter: Important Word-Aware Clip Filtering via Scene Understanding for Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22906v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video moment retrieval (MR) and highlight detection (HD) with natural language queries aim to localize relevant moments and key highlights in a video clips. However, existing methods overlook the importance of individual words, treating the entire text query and video clips as a black-box, which hinders contextual understanding. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enables fine-grained clip filtering by identifying and prioritizing important words in the query. Our method integrates image-text scene understanding through Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and enhances the semantic understanding of video clips. We introduce a feature enhancement module (FEM) to capture important words from the query and a ranking-based filtering module (RFM) to iteratively refine video clips based on their relevance to these important words. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in both MR and HD tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/VisualAIKHU/SRF.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-like Model as a Foundational Density Ratio Estimator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22881v2)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density ratio estimation is a core concept in statistical machine learning because it provides a unified mechanism for tasks such as importance weighting, divergence estimation, and likelihood-free inference, but its potential in vision and language models has not been fully explored. Modern vision-language encoders such as CLIP and SigLIP are trained with contrastive objectives that implicitly optimize log density ratios between joint and marginal image-text distributions, which implicitly learn similarity scores proportional to log density ratios. However, prior work has largely focused on their embedding utility, and the density-ratio structure induced by contrastive learning has not been systematically examined or exploited in multimodal applications. To address this gap, we reinterpret CLIP-style models as pretrained and general-purpose density ratio estimators and show that this perspective enables new algorithmic capabilities. We present a unified explanation of how contrastive objectives estimate density ratios and propose two practical applications: Importance Weight Learning and KL divergence estimation. Our Importance Weight Learning method requires only a single additional prompt and improves F1 scores by up to 7 points. We further show that CLIP-based density ratios support estimation of KL divergences that quantify how conditioning on an image or text alters the distribution of the other modality. Through qualitative examples and an N-gram analysis of captions, we find that these divergences capture semantic diversity and mode structure in multimodal data. Leveraging this property, we introduce a simple KL-guided data curation method that achieves performance competitive with LAION2B filtering.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAHS-Attack: CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search Attack Method for Stable Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21180v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models exhibit notable fragility when faced with adversarial prompts, and strengthening attack capabilities is crucial for uncovering such vulnerabilities and building more robust generative systems. Existing works often rely on white-box access to model gradients or hand-crafted prompt engineering, which is infeasible in real-world deployments due to restricted access or poor attack effect. In this paper, we propose CAHS-Attack , a CLIP-Aware Heuristic Search attack method. CAHS-Attack integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to perform fine-grained suffix optimization, leveraging a constrained genetic algorithm to preselect high-potential adversarial prompts as root nodes, and retaining the most semantically disruptive outcome at each simulation rollout for efficient local search. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art attack performance across both short and long prompts of varying semantics. Furthermore, we find that the fragility of SD models can be attributed to the inherent vulnerability of their CLIP-based text encoders, suggesting a fundamental security risk in current text-to-image pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Remeshing Method via Adaptive Multiple Original-Facet-Clipping and Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14306v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CVT (Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation)-based remeshing optimizes mesh quality by leveraging the Voronoi-Delaunay framework to optimize vertex distribution and produce uniformly distributed vertices with regular triangles. Current CVT-based approaches can be classified into two categories: (1) exact methods (e.g., Geodesic CVT, Restricted Voronoi Diagrams) that ensure high quality but require significant computation; and (2) approximate methods that try to reduce computational complexity yet result in fair quality. To address this trade-off, we propose a CVT-based surface remeshing approach that achieves balanced optimization between quality and efficiency through multiple clipping times of 3D Centroidal Voronoi cells with curvature-adaptive original surface facets. The core idea of the method is that we adaptively adjust the number of clipping times according to local curvature, and use the angular relationship between the normal vectors of neighboring facets to represent the magnitude of local curvature. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00098v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains. Code of all experiments and benchmarks is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-pfl4asr.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[CLIP-IT: CLIP-based Pairing for Histology Images Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16181v5)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal learning has shown promise in medical imaging, combining complementary modalities like images and text. Vision-language models (VLMs) capture rich diagnostic cues but often require large paired datasets and prompt- or text-based inference, limiting their practicality due to annotation cost, privacy, and compute demands. Crucially, available free unpaired external text, like pathology reports, can still provide complementary diagnostic cues if semantically relevant content is retrievable per image. To address this, we introduce CLIP-IT, a novel framework that relies on rich unpaired text reports. Specifically, CLIP-IT uses a CLIP model pre-trained on histology image-text pairs from a separate dataset to retrieve the most relevant unpaired textual report for each image in the downstream unimodal dataset. These reports, sourced from the same disease domain and tissue type, form pseudo-pairs that reflect shared clinical semantics rather than exact alignment. Knowledge from these texts is distilled into the vision model during training, while LoRA-based adaptation mitigates the semantic gap between unaligned modalities. At inference, only the vision model is used, keeping overhead low while still benefiting from multimodal training without requiring paired data in the downstream dataset. Experiments on histology image datasets confirm that CLIP-IT consistently improves classification accuracy over both unimodal and multimodal CLIP-based baselines in most cases, without the burden of per-dataset paired annotation or inference-time complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Semantics Regulate: Rethinking Patch Shuffle and Internal Bias for Generated Image Detection with CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19126v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of GANs and Diffusion Models poses new challenges for detecting AI-generated images. Although CLIP-based detectors exhibit promising generalization, they often rely on semantic cues rather than generator artifacts, leading to brittle performance under distribution shifts. In this work, we revisit the nature of semantic bias and uncover that Patch Shuffle provides an unusually strong benefit for CLIP, that disrupts global semantic continuity while preserving local artifact cues, which reduces semantic entropy and homogenizes feature distributions between natural and synthetic images. Through a detailed layer-wise analysis, we further show that CLIP's deep semantic structure functions as a regulator that stabilizes cross-domain representations once semantic bias is suppressed. Guided by these findings, we propose SemAnti, a semantic-antagonistic fine-tuning paradigm that freezes the semantic subspace and adapts only artifact-sensitive layers under shuffled semantics. Despite its simplicity, SemAnti achieves state-of-the-art cross-domain generalization on AIGCDetectBenchmark and GenImage, demonstrating that regulating semantics is key to unlocking CLIP's full potential for robust AI-generated image detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 7 figures and 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Prototypical Contrastive Learning-based CLIP Fine-tuning for Object Re-identification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17218v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work aims to adapt large-scale pre-trained vision-language models, such as contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP), to enhance the performance of object reidentification (Re-ID) across various supervision settings. Although prompt learning has enabled a recent work named CLIP-ReID to achieve promising performance, the underlying mechanisms and the necessity of prompt learning remain unclear due to the absence of semantic labels in ReID tasks. In this work, we first analyze the role prompt learning in CLIP-ReID and identify its limitations. Based on our investigations, we propose a simple yet effective approach to adapt CLIP for supervised object Re-ID. Our approach directly fine-tunes the image encoder of CLIP using a prototypical contrastive learning (PCL) loss, eliminating the need for prompt learning. Experimental results on both person and vehicle Re-ID datasets demonstrate the competitiveness of our method compared to CLIP-ReID. Furthermore, we extend our PCL-based CLIP fine-tuning approach to unsupervised scenarios, where we achieve state-of-the art performance.</p></details> |  |

Yet, data itself remains an underexplored factor in this process. We revisit this task from a data-centric perspective: Can effective data selection substitute for large-scale datasets in CPT? We introduce CHIPS (Curvature-aware Hybrid Influence in Projection Subspace), which assigns each image-text pair a utility score that integrates three complementary factors aligned with three goals: faithfulness via a curvature-aware, Newton-style alignment computed in CLIP's end-point subspace; scalability via an InfoNCE-aware curvature estimator with Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) sketching; and retention via a selection-aware relevance weight combined with learnability to balance target adaptation against general-domain preservation. We justify this design theoretically by proving a lower-bound guarantee on the proxy's correlation with full-parameter alignment and by characterizing the bias-variance trade-offs introduced by curvature mixing and JL sketching. We evaluate CHIPS empirically across various settings: 1) CHIPS attains state-of-the-art performance among selection baselines on 17 medical benchmarks, matches full-dataset CPT with 30% of the data, and outperforms half-dataset CPT using only 10%; 2) on 31 general-domain benchmarks, CHIPS yields the smallest performance drop under 10-30% data-retention budgets. Code, data, and checkpoints will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, under-review</p></details> |

Current methods rely on human supervision but become impractical as model complexity increases. When models surpass human knowledge, providing accurate feedback becomes challenging and inefficient. A novel solution proposed recently is using a weaker model to supervise a stronger model. This concept leverages the ability of weaker models to perform evaluations, thereby reducing the workload on human supervisors. Previous work has shown the effectiveness of weak-to-strong generalization in the context of language-only models. Extending this concept to vision-language models leverages these insights, adapting the proven benefits to a multi-modal context. In our study, we explore weak-to-strong generalization for CLIP-based classification. We propose a method, class prototype learning (CPL), which aims to enhance the classification capabilities of the CLIP model, by learning more representative prototypes for each category. Our findings indicate that, despite using a simple loss function under weak supervision, CPL yields robust improvements in targeted scenarios, particularly when pretraining is limited. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach is effective under these settings, achieving a 3.67% improvement over strong baseline methods.</p></details> | TMLR |

We believe that the main ingredient to the success of CLIP is its data and not the model architecture or pre-training objective. However, CLIP only provides very limited information about its data and how it has been collected, leading to works that aim to reproduce CLIP's data by filtering with its model parameters. In this work, we intend to reveal CLIP's data curation approach and in our pursuit of making it open to the community introduce Metadata-Curated Language-Image Pre-training (MetaCLIP). MetaCLIP takes a raw data pool and metadata (derived from CLIP's concepts) and yields a balanced subset over the metadata distribution. Our experimental study rigorously isolates the model and training settings, concentrating solely on data. MetaCLIP applied to CommonCrawl with 400M image-text data pairs outperforms CLIP's data on multiple standard benchmarks. In zero-shot ImageNet classification, MetaCLIP achieves 70.8% accuracy, surpassing CLIP's 68.3% on ViT-B models. Scaling to 1B data, while maintaining the same training budget, attains 72.4%. Our observations hold across various model sizes, exemplified by ViT-H achieving 80.5%, without any bells-and-whistles.

Knowledge distillation (KD) has emerged as a powerful approach for building lightweight but competitive models, with strong evidence from both language and vision domains. However, its application to VLMs, particularly CLIP-style models, remains limited, often constrained to small-scale teachers and narrow evaluation tasks such as classification or retrieval. In this work, we present the first systematic study of distillation across a range of CLIP-style teacher models, ranging from standard baselines to large-scale state-of-the-art models. Contrary to trends observed in NLP and vision, we find that stronger teachers do not consistently yield better students; in fact, existing distillation frameworks often fail to scale, leading to degraded performance in downstream multimodal tasks such as visual question answering. Our findings challenge prevailing assumptions in KD and point toward new directions for designing parameter-efficient multimodal models.</p></details> |  |

As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.</p></details> | 16 pages |

We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift. Our work shows that respecting the geometry of pretrained representations is key to achieving safety without sacrificing performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (Main Technical Track)</p></details> |

We provide evidence in both simulation and the real world that this approach outperforms the common paradigm of training agents in isolation with rewards that prescribe behavior, e.g., progress on the raceline, in particular when the complexity of the environment increases, e.g., in the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we find that multi-agent competition yields policies that transfer more reliably to the real world than policies trained with a single-agent progress-based reward, despite the two methods using the same simulation environment, randomization strategy, and hardware. In addition to improved sim-to-real transfer, the multi-agent policies also exhibit some degree of generalization to opponents unseen at training time. Overall, our work, following in the tradition of multi-agent competitive game-play in digital domains, shows that sparse task-level rewards are sufficient for training agents capable of advanced low-level control in the physical world.

Existing LLM-based summarizers remain generic and fail to account for individual preferences, limiting their practical utility. We propose SUMFORU, a steerable review summarization framework that aligns outputs with explicit user personas to support personalized purchase decisions. Our approach integrates a high-quality data pipeline built from the Amazon 2023 Review Dataset with a two-stage alignment procedure: (1) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (2) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals. We evaluate the model across rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics, demonstrating consistent improvements in consistency, grounding, and preference alignment. Our framework achieves the highest performance across all evaluation settings and generalizes effectively to unseen product categories. Our results highlight the promise of steerable pluralistic alignment for building next-generation personalized decision-support systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/Harry20030331/SumForU</p></details> |

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability. This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation, 121 pages, ISBN: 978-9935-9826-5-0.

In this paper we leverage new results from off-policy evaluation; it has recently been shown that well-designed behaviour policies can be used to collect off-policy data for provably lower variance return estimates. This result is surprising as it means collecting data on-policy is not variance optimal. We extend this key insight to the online reinforcement learning setting, where both policy evaluation and improvement are interleaved to learn optimal policies. Off-policy RL has been well studied (e.g., IMPALA), with correct and truncated importance weighted samples for de-biasing and managing variance appropriately. Generally these approaches are concerned with reconciling data collected from multiple workers in parallel, while the policy is updated asynchronously, mismatch between the workers and policy is corrected in a mathematically sound way. Here we consider only one worker - the behaviour policy, which is used to collect data for policy improvement, with provably lower variance return estimates. In our experiments we extend two policy-gradient methods with this regime, demonstrating better sample efficiency and performance over a diverse set of environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026 (main track)</p></details> |

Compared to the wide application of binary human feedback, scalar human feedback has been used less because it is believed to be noisy and unstable. In this paper, we compare scalar and binary feedback, and demonstrate that scalar feedback benefits learning when properly handled. We collected binary or scalar feedback respectively from two groups of crowdworkers on a robot task. We found that when considering how consistently a participant labeled the same data, scalar feedback led to less consistency than binary feedback; however, the difference vanishes if small mismatches are allowed. Additionally, scalar and binary feedback show no significant differences in their correlations with key Reinforcement Learning targets. We then introduce Stabilizing TEacher Assessment DYnamics (STEADY) to improve learning from scalar feedback. Based on the idea that scalar feedback is muti-distributional, STEADY re-constructs underlying positive and negative feedback distributions and re-scales scalar feedback based on feedback statistics. We show that models trained with \textit{scalar feedback + STEADY } outperform baselines, including binary feedback and raw scalar feedback, in a robot reaching task with non-expert human feedback. Our results show that both binary feedback and scalar feedback are dynamic, and scalar feedback is a promising signal for use in interactive Reinforcement Learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iterative Compositional Data Generation for Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10891v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Collecting robotic manipulation data is expensive, making it impractical to acquire demonstrations for the combinatorially large space of tasks that arise in multi-object, multi-robot, and multi-environment settings. While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected reference chronological order and added acknowledgements; results unchanged</p></details> |

The development of advanced control strategies for complex scenarios is hindered, however, by the lack of scalability and robustness of the existing methods, in particular, due to the need of an individual control for each agent. One possible solution involves controlling a system through a leader or a group of leaders, which other agents tend to follow. Using such an approach we develop an effective control strategy for a leader, combining reinforcement learning (RL) with artificial forces acting on the system. To describe the guidance of active particles by a leader we introduce the generalized Vicsek model. This novel method is then applied to the problem of the effective evacuation by a robot-rescuer (leader) of large groups of people from hazardous places. We demonstrate, that while a straightforward application of RL yields suboptimal results, even for advanced architectures, our approach provides a robust and efficient evacuation strategy.

Although some studies have attempted to bridge this gap using reinforcement learning, they remain confined to merely reproducing human manipulation, resulting in limited task performance. In this paper, we propose UniBYD, a unified framework that uses a dynamic reinforcement learning algorithm to discover manipulation policies aligned with the robot's physical characteristics. To enable consistent modeling across diverse robotic hand morphologies, UniBYD incorporates a unified morphological representation (UMR). Building on UMR, we design a dynamic PPO with an annealed reward schedule, enabling reinforcement learning to transition from imitation of human demonstrations to explore policies adapted to diverse robotic morphologies better, thereby going beyond mere imitation of human hands. To address the frequent failures of learning human priors in the early training stage, we design a hybrid Markov-based shadow engine that enables reinforcement learning to imitate human manipulations in a fine-grained manner. To evaluate UniBYD comprehensively, we propose UniManip, the first benchmark encompassing robotic manipulation tasks spanning multiple hand morphologies. Experiments demonstrate a 67.90% improvement in success rate over the current state-of-the-art. Upon acceptance of the paper, we will release our code and benchmark at https://github.com/zhanheng-creator/UniBYD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Achieving Olympia-Level Geometry Large Language Model Agent via Complexity Boosting Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10534v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents exhibit strong mathematical problem-solving abilities and can even solve International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) level problems with the assistance of formal proof systems. However, due to weak heuristics for auxiliary constructions, AI for geometry problem solving remains dominated by expert models such as AlphaGeometry 2, which rely heavily on large-scale data synthesis and search for both training and evaluation. In this work, we make the first attempt to build a medalist-level LLM agent for geometry and present InternGeometry. InternGeometry overcomes the heuristic limitations in geometry by iteratively proposing propositions and auxiliary constructions, verifying them with a symbolic engine, and reflecting on the engine's feedback to guide subsequent proposals. A dynamic memory mechanism enables InternGeometry to conduct more than two hundred interactions with the symbolic engine per problem. To further accelerate learning, we introduce Complexity-Boosting Reinforcement Learning (CBRL), which gradually increases the complexity of synthesized problems across training stages. Built on InternThinker-32B, InternGeometry solves 44 of 50 IMO geometry problems (2000-2024), exceeding the average gold medalist score (40.9), using only 13K training examples, just 0.004% of the data used by AlphaGeometry 2, demonstrating the potential of LLM agents on expert-level geometry tasks. InternGeometry can also propose novel auxiliary constructions for IMO problems that do not appear in human solutions. We will release the model, data, and symbolic engine to support future research.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we present DentalGPT, a specialized dental MLLM developed through high-quality domain knowledge injection and reinforcement learning. Specifically, the largest annotated multimodal dataset for dentistry to date was constructed by aggregating over 120k dental images paired with detailed descriptions that highlight diagnostically relevant visual features, making it the multimodal dataset with the most extensive collection of dental images to date. Training on this dataset significantly enhances the MLLM's visual understanding of dental conditions, while the subsequent reinforcement learning stage further strengthens its capability for multimodal complex reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on intraoral and panoramic benchmarks, along with dental subsets of medical VQA benchmarks, show that DentalGPT achieves superior performance in disease classification and dental VQA tasks, outperforming many state-of-the-art MLLMs despite having only 7B parameters. These results demonstrate that high-quality dental data combined with staged adaptation provides an effective pathway for building capable and domain-specialized dental MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Unmasking Policies for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09106v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion (Large) Language Models (dLLMs) now match the downstream performance of their autoregressive counterparts on many tasks, while holding the promise of being more efficient during inference. One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: F...</summary><p>V2: Fixed typo in author list.

We propose the Plasticity-Ceiling Framework to theoretically ground this landscape, decomposing performance into foundational SFT performance and the subsequent RL plasticity. Through extensive benchmarking, we establish the Sequential SFT-then-RL pipeline as the superior standard, overcoming the stability deficits of synchronized approaches. Furthermore, we derive precise scaling guidelines: (1) Transitioning to RL at the SFT Stable or Mild Overfitting Sub-phase maximizes the final ceiling by securing foundational SFT performance without compromising RL plasticity; (2) Refuting ``Less is More'' in the context of SFT-then-RL scaling, we demonstrate that Data Scale determines the primary post-training potential, while Trajectory Difficulty acts as a performance multiplier; and (3) Identifying that the Minimum SFT Validation Loss serves as a robust indicator for selecting the expert trajectories that maximize the final performance ceiling. Our findings provide actionable guidelines for maximizing the value extracted from expert trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, under review</p></details> |

While classical methods like Integer Linear Programming (ILP) guarantee optimal solutions, they face exponential scaling with grid size, and recent advances in machine learning offer promising alternatives for pattern-based approximation. This paper presents the first systematic comparison of classical optimization and AI approaches to this problem, evaluating their performance against traditional algorithms. We apply PatternBoost transformer learning and reinforcement learning (PPO) to this problem for the first time, comparing them against ILP. ILP achieves provably optimal solutions up to 19 by 19 grids, while PatternBoost matches optimal performance up to 14 by 14 grids with 96% test loss reduction. PPO achieves perfect solutions on 10 by 10 grids but fails at 11 by 11 grids, where constraint violations prevent valid configurations. These results demonstrate that classical optimization remains essential for exact solutions while AI methods offer competitive performance on smaller instances, with hybrid approaches presenting the most promising direction for scaling to larger problem sizes.</p></details> |  |

However, safety alignment under Reinforcement Learning (RL) often suffers from forgetting learned general abilities, which is also known as the alignment tax. To address this issue, we introduce Null-Space constrained Policy Optimization (NSPO), a novel RL framework for LLM safety alignment while preserving their core abilities. The safety policy gradients are geometrically projected into the null space of general tasks, thereby mitigating the safety alignment tax. In addition, we theoretically prove that NSPO preserves the model's original core capabilities, while still guaranteeing a descent direction for effective safety alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSPO outperforms existing methods by a large margin, achieving state-of-the-art safety performance without sacrificing accuracy on general tasks, including math, code, and instruction-following tasks. Notably, NSPO is data-efficient and only requires 40% of public human-annotated safety data from PKU-SafeRLHF to achieve promising safety performance, without a large amount of mixed general tasks data in existing alignment methods.</p></details> |  |

While steering these policies with reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising mechanism for fine-tuning beyond demonstration data, directly applying standard (non-equivariant) RL can be sample-inefficient and unstable, as it ignores the symmetries that EDPs are designed to exploit. In this paper, we theoretically establish that the diffusion process of an EDP is equivariant, which in turn induces a group-invariant latent-noise MDP that is well-suited for equivariant diffusion steering. Building on this theory, we introduce a principled symmetry-aware steering framework and compare standard, equivariant, and approximately equivariant RL strategies through comprehensive experiments across tasks with varying degrees of symmetry. While we identify the practical boundaries of strict equivariance under symmetry breaking, we show that exploiting symmetry during the steering process yields substantial benefits-enhancing sample efficiency, preventing value divergence, and achieving strong policy improvements even when EDPs are trained from extremely limited demonstrations.</p></details> |  |

However, existing tools rely on fixed optimization strategies inherited from software compilations, limiting their effectiveness. Tailoring optimization strategies to specific designs requires deep semantic understanding, accurate hardware metric estimation, and advanced search algorithms -- capabilities that current approaches lack. We propose DAPO, a design structure-aware pass ordering framework that extracts program semantics from control and data flow graphs, employs contrastive learning to generate rich embeddings, and leverages an analytical model for accurate hardware metric estimation. These components jointly guide a reinforcement learning agent to discover design-specific optimization strategies. Evaluations on classic HLS designs demonstrate that our end-to-end flow delivers a 2.36 speedup over Vitis HLS on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DATE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Equilibrium Policy Generalization: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Cross-Graph Zero-Shot Generalization in Pursuit-Evasion Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00811v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Equilibrium learning in adversarial games is an important topic widely examined in the fields of game theory and reinforcement learning (RL). Pursuit-evasion game (PEG), as an important class of real-world games from the fields of robotics and security, requires exponential time to be accurately solved. When the underlying graph structure varies, even the state-of-the-art RL methods require recomputation or at least fine-tuning, which can be time-consuming and impair real-time applicability. This paper proposes an Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) framework to effectively learn a generalized policy with robust cross-graph zero-shot performance. In the context of PEGs, our framework is generally applicable to both pursuer and evader sides in both no-exit and multi-exit scenarios. These two generalizability properties, to our knowledge, are the first to appear in this domain. The core idea of the EPG framework is to train an RL policy across different graph structures against the equilibrium policy for each single graph. To construct an equilibrium oracle for single-graph policies, we present a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm that provably generates pure-strategy Nash equilibrium with near-optimal time complexity. To guarantee scalability with respect to pursuer number, we further extend DP and RL by designing a grouping mechanism and a sequence model for joint policy decomposition, respectively. Experimental results show that, using equilibrium guidance and a distance feature proposed for cross-graph PEG training, the EPG framework guarantees desirable zero-shot performance in various unseen real-world graphs. Besides, when trained under an equilibrium heuristic proposed for the graphs with exits, our generalized pursuer policy can even match the performance of the fine-tuned policies from the state-of-the-art PEG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[RollMux: Phase-Level Multiplexing for Disaggregated RL Post-Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11306v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rollout-training disaggregation is emerging as the standard architecture for Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training, where memory-bound rollout and compute-bound training are physically disaggregated onto purpose-built clusters to maximize hardware efficiency. However, the strict synchronization required by on-policy algorithms introduces severe dependency bubbles, forcing one cluster to idle while the dependent phase is running on the other. We present RollMux, a cluster scheduling framework that reclaims these bubbles through cross-cluster orchestration. RollMux is built on the insight that the structural idleness of one job can be effectively utilized by the active phase of another. To realize this, we introduce the co-execution group abstraction, which partitions the cluster into isolated locality domains. This abstraction enables a two-tier scheduling architecture: an inter-group scheduler that optimizes job placement using conservative stochastic planning, and an intra-group scheduler that orchestrates a provably optimal round-robin schedule. The group abstraction also imposes a residency constraint, ensuring that massive model states remain cached in host memory to enable "warm-star" context switching. We evaluate RollMux on a production-scale testbed with 328 H20 and 328 H800 GPUs. RollMux improves cost efficiency by 1.84x over standard disaggregation and 1.38x over state-of-the-art co-located baselines, all while achieving 100% SLO attainment.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |
| **[SATURN: SAT-based Reinforcement Learning to Unleash LLMs Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16368v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How to design reinforcement learning (RL) tasks that effectively unleash the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) remains an open question. Existing RL tasks (e.g., math, programming, and constructing reasoning tasks) suffer from three key limitations: (1) Scalability. They rely heavily on human annotation or expensive LLM synthesis to generate sufficient training data. (2) Verifiability. LLMs' outputs are hard to verify automatically and reliably. (3) Controllable Difficulty. Most tasks lack fine-grained difficulty control, making it hard to train LLMs to develop reasoning ability from easy to hard. To address these limitations, we propose Saturn, a SAT-based RL framework that uses Boolean Satisfiability (SAT) problems to train and evaluate LLMs reasoning. Saturn enables scalable task construction, rule-based verification, and precise difficulty control. Saturn designs a curriculum learning pipeline that continuously improves LLMs' reasoning capability by constructing SAT tasks of increasing difficulty and training LLMs from easy to hard. To ensure stable training, we design a principled mechanism to control difficulty transitions. We introduce Saturn-2.6k, a dataset of 2,660 SAT problems with varying difficulty. It supports the evaluation of how LLM reasoning changes with problem difficulty. We apply Saturn to DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen and obtain Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B. We achieve several notable results: (1) On SAT problems, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B achieve average pass@3 improvements of +14.0 and +28.1, respectively. (2) On math and programming tasks, Saturn-1.5B and Saturn-7B improve average scores by +4.9 and +1.8 on benchmarks (e.g., AIME, LiveCodeBench). (3) Compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach in constructing RL tasks, Saturn achieves further improvements of +8.8%. We release the source code, data, and models to support future research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce RL-QR, a novel annotation-free reinforcement learning framework for query rewriting that eliminates the need for costly human-annotated data. By leveraging verifiable search rewards derived from index-aligned synthetic queries, RL-QR overcomes human-annotation dependencies, extending its applicability to various modalities and index domains. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's robustness, achieving substantial retrieval performance gains of up to 3.9$\times$ on lexical retrievers and 3.5$\times$ on semantic retrievers on the MTEB VIDORE V2 benchmark for unstructured visual documents, along with consistent 5\% to 10\% improvements on MS MARCO v2.1 and internal industrial datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Actions Teach You to Think: Reasoning-Action Synergy via Reinforcement Learning in Conversational Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11277v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as one of the most effective ways to improve the performance of large language models (LLMs) in downstream tasks. However, SFT can have difficulty generalizing when the underlying data distribution changes, even when the new data does not fall completely outside the training domain. Recent reasoning-focused models such as o1 and R1 have demonstrated consistent gains over their non-reasoning counterparts, highlighting the importance of reasoning for improved generalization and reliability. However, collecting high-quality reasoning traces for SFT remains challenging -- annotations are costly, subjective, and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we leverage Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enable models to learn reasoning strategies directly from task outcomes. We propose a pipeline in which LLMs generate reasoning steps that guide both the invocation of tools (e.g., function calls) and the final answer generation for conversational agents. Our method employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with rewards designed around tool accuracy and answer correctness, allowing the model to iteratively refine its reasoning and actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach improves both the quality of reasoning and the precision of tool invocations, achieving a 1.5% relative improvement over the SFT model (trained without explicit thinking) and a 40% gain compared to the base of the vanilla Qwen3-1.7B model. These findings demonstrate the promise of unifying reasoning and action learning through RL to build more capable and generalizable conversational agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A-LAMP: Agentic LLM-Based Framework for Automated MDP Modeling and Policy Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11270v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world tasks requires converting informal descriptions into a formal Markov decision process (MDP), implementing an executable environment, and training a policy agent. Automating this process is challenging due to modeling errors, fragile code, and misaligned objectives, which often impede policy training. We introduce an agentic large language model (LLM)-based framework for automated MDP modeling and policy generation (A-LAMP), that automatically translates free-form natural language task descriptions into an MDP formulation and trained policy. The framework decomposes modeling, coding, and training into verifiable stages, ensuring semantic alignment throughout the pipeline. Across both classic control and custom RL domains, A-LAMP consistently achieves higher policy generation capability than a single state-of-the-art LLM model. Notably, even its lightweight variant, which is built on smaller language models, approaches the performance of much larger models. Failure analysis reveals why these improvements occur. In addition, a case study also demonstrates that A-LAMP generates environments and policies that preserve the task's optimality, confirming its correctness and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Workshop: Multi-Turn Interactions in Large Language Models. 26 pages, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[A Unified Model for Multi-Task Drone Routing in Post-Disaster Road Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21525v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-disaster road assessment (PDRA) is essential for emergency response, enabling rapid evaluation of infrastructure conditions and efficient allocation of resources. Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA, routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Exact and heuristic optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm, requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6-14%, heuristic algorithms by 22-42%, and commercial solvers by 24-82% in terms of solution quality (total collected information value). The model achieves rapid solutions (1-10 seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining high solution quality. The source code for UM is publicly available at https://github.com/PJ-HTU/UM_PDRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 8 figures,9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Long-horizon Reasoning Agent for Olympiad-Level Mathematical Problem Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10739v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have expanded the mathematical reasoning frontier through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), capable of solving AIME-level problems. However, the performance of LRMs is heavily dependent on the extended reasoning context length. For solving ultra-hard problems like those in the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), the required reasoning complexity surpasses the space that an LRM can explore in a single round. Previous works attempt to extend the reasoning context of LRMs but remain prompt-based and built upon proprietary models, lacking systematic structures and training pipelines. Therefore, this paper introduces Intern-S1-MO, a long-horizon math agent that conducts multi-round hierarchical reasoning, composed of an LRM-based multi-agent system including reasoning, summary, and verification. By maintaining a compact memory in the form of lemmas, Intern-S1-MO can more freely explore the lemma-rich reasoning spaces in multiple reasoning stages, thereby breaking through the context constraints for IMO-level math problems. Furthermore, we propose OREAL-H, an RL framework for training the LRM using the online explored trajectories to simultaneously bootstrap the reasoning ability of LRM and elevate the overall performance of Intern-S1-MO. Experiments show that Intern-S1-MO can obtain 26 out of 35 points on the non-geometry problems of IMO2025, matching the performance of silver medalists. It also surpasses the current advanced LRMs on inference benchmarks such as HMMT2025, AIME2025, and CNMO2025. In addition, our agent officially participates in CMO2025 and achieves a score of 102/126 under the judgment of human experts, reaching the gold medal level.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICPO: Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization for Efficient Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21005v4)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) demonstrates significant potential in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods are often constrained by issues such as coarse-grained rewards, reward noise, and inefficient exploration, which lead to unstable training and entropy collapse. To address this challenge, we propose the Intrinsic Confidence-Driven Group Relative Preference Optimization method (ICPO). The intuition behind it lies in the fact that the probabilities of an LLM generating different responses can inherently and directly reflect its self-assessment of the reasoning process. Inspired by the idea of preference modeling, ICPO calculates a preference advantage score for each response by comparing the relative generation probabilities of multiple responses under the same input prompt, and integrates this score with verifiable rewards to guide the exploration process. We have discovered that the preference advantage score not only alleviates the issues of coarse-grained rewards and reward noise but also effectively curbs overconfident errors, enhances the relative superiority of undervalued high-quality responses, and prevents the model from overfitting to specific strategies. Comprehensive experiments across four general-domain benchmarks and three mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that ICPO steadily boosts reasoning compared to GRPO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning for Large-Scale Mixed Traffic Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11247v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective mixed traffic control requires balancing efficiency, fairness, and safety. Existing approaches excel at optimizing efficiency and enforcing safety constraints but lack mechanisms to ensure equitable service, resulting in systematic starvation of vehicles on low-demand approaches. We propose a hierarchical framework combining multi-objective reinforcement learning for local intersection control with strategic routing for network-level coordination. Our approach introduces a Conflict Threat Vector that provides agents with explicit risk signals for proactive conflict avoidance, and a queue parity penalty that ensures equitable service across all traffic streams. Extensive experiments on a real-world network across different robot vehicle (RV) penetration rates demonstrate substantial improvements: up to 53% reductions in average wait time, up to 86% reductions in maximum starvation, and up to 86\% reduction in conflict rate compared to baselines, while maintaining fuel efficiency. Our analysis reveals that strategic routing effectiveness scales with RV penetration, becoming increasingly valuable at higher autonomy levels. The results demonstrate that multi-objective optimization through well-curated reward functions paired with strategic RV routing yields significant benefits in fairness and safety metrics critical for equitable mixed-autonomy deployment.</p></details> |  |

The generation stage generates samples that are then used to infer learnable experiences for training. We observe that the generation stage is the bottleneck of the entire execution process and consider it a key point for optimization. Specifically, we realize the first attempt to integrate speculative decoding into the RLHF generation stage and propose RLHFSpec, an RLHF system that accelerates generation execution with efficient speculative decoding and sample reallocation. To fully exploit the performance potential provided by speculative decoding, especially dealing with the dynamic workload of the generation stage, RLHFSpec proposes a workload-aware drafting strategy selection mechanism, which selects the near-optimal strategy by jointly considering the verification cost and the number of accepted tokens. Moreover, RLHFSpec also proposes sample reallocation to fully utilize the GPU resources, and optimizes it with an efficient sample migration mechanism. The experimental results show that the RLHFSpec can achieve higher throughput in the generation stage compared to state-of-the-art works. Moreover, due to the effective alleviation of the generation bottleneck, RLHFSpec also shows significant performance speedup in the entire RLHF execution.</p></details> |  |

This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.52x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve challenging tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark that the baseline fails to learn, without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://andrewcwlee.github.io/gaze-on-the-prize</p></details> |

Using CUDA execution speed as the RL reward, CUDA-L2 automatically optimizes HGEMM kernels across 1,000 configurations. CUDA-L2 systematically outperforms major matmul baselines to date, from the widely-used torch.matmul to state-of-the-art Nvidia's closed-source libraries, i.e., cuBLAS, cuBLASLt. In offline mode, where kernels are executed consecutively without time intervals, CUDA-L2 yields +22.0% over torch.matmul on average; +19.2% over cuBLAS using the optimal layout configuration (normal-normal NN and transposed-normal TN); +16.8% over cuBLASLt-heuristic, which queries cuBLASLt library and selects the algorithm based on the heuristic's suggestion; and +11.4% over the most competitive cuBLASLt-AutoTuning model, which selects the fastest algorithm from up to 100 candidates from cuBLASLt's suggestions. In server mode, where kernels are executed at random intervals simulating real-time inference, the speedups further increase to +28.7%, +26.0%, +22.4%, and +15.9% for torch.matmul, cuBLAS, cuBLASLt-heuristic, and cuBLASLt-AutoTuning respectively. CUDA-L2 shows that even the most performance-critical, heavily-optimized kernels like HGEMM can be improved through LLM-guided RL automation by systematically exploring configuration spaces at scales impractical for humans.

However, medical image annotation is highly time-consuming, hindering its clinical applications. Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has been emerged as an appealing strategy in training with limited annotations, largely reducing the labelling cost. We propose a novel SSL framework SSL-MedSAM2, which contains a training-free few-shot learning branch TFFS-MedSAM2 based on the pretrained large foundation model Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) for pseudo label generation, and an iterative fully-supervised learning branch FSL-nnUNet based on nnUNet for pseudo label refinement. The results on MICCAI2025 challenge CARE-LiSeg (Liver Segmentation) demonstrate an outstanding performance of SSL-MedSAM2 among other methods. The average dice scores on the test set in GED4 and T1 MRI are 0.9710 and 0.9648 respectively, and the Hausdorff distances are 20.07 and 21.97 respectively.

Recently, DINOv3 has shown remarkable promise in medical image segmentation with its powerful representation capabilities. However, DINOv3, pre-trained on natural images, lacks sensitivity to ultrasound-specific boundary degradation. To address this limitation, we propose FreqDINO, a frequency-guided segmentation framework that enhances boundary perception and structural consistency. Specifically, we devise a Multi-scale Frequency Extraction and Alignment (MFEA) strategy to separate low-frequency structures and multi-scale high-frequency boundary details, and align them via learnable attention. We also introduce a Frequency-Guided Boundary Refinement (FGBR) module that extracts boundary prototypes from high-frequency components and refines spatial features. Furthermore, we design a Multi-task Boundary-Guided Decoder (MBGD) to ensure spatial coherence between boundary and semantic predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FreqDINO surpasses state-of-the-art methods with superior achieves remarkable generalization capability.

While prior work has largely focused on pixel-level uncertainty, landmark-based segmentation offers inherent topological guarantees yet remains underexplored from an uncertainty perspective. In this work, we study uncertainty estimation for anatomical landmark-based segmentation on chest X-rays. Inspired by hybrid neural network architectures that combine standard image convolutional encoders with graph-based generative decoders, and leveraging their variational latent space, we derive two complementary measures: (i) latent uncertainty, captured directly from the learned distribution parameters, and (ii) predictive uncertainty, obtained by generating multiple stochastic output predictions from latent samples. Through controlled corruption experiments we show that both uncertainty measures increase with perturbation severity, reflecting both global and local degradation. We demonstrate that these uncertainty signals can identify unreliable predictions by comparing with manual ground-truth, and support out-of-distribution detection on the CheXmask dataset. More importantly, we release CheXmask-U (huggingface.co/datasets/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U), a large scale dataset of 657,566 chest X-ray landmark segmentations with per-node uncertainty estimates, enabling researchers to account for spatial variations in segmentation quality when using these anatomical masks. Our findings establish uncertainty estimation as a promising direction to enhance robustness and safe deployment of landmark-based anatomical segmentation methods in chest X-ray. A fully working interactive demo of the method is available at huggingface.co/spaces/matiasky/CheXmask-U and the source code at github.com/mcosarinsky/CheXmask-U.</p></details> |  |

However, existing biomedical AI models generally lack the ability to simultaneously generate diagnostic findings and localize corresponding biomedical objects. This limitation makes it challenging for clinicians to correlate AI-generated findings with visual evidence (e.g., tiny lesions) in images and interpret the results of AI models. To address this challenge, we introduce UniBiomed, the first universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation, which is capable of generating accurate diagnostic findings and simultaneously segmenting the corresponding biomedical targets. UniBiomed is based on a novel integration of Multi-modal Large Language Model and Segment Anything Model, which can effectively unify diverse biomedical tasks in universal training for advancing grounded interpretation. To develop UniBiomed, we curate a large-scale dataset comprising over 27 million triplets of images, region annotations, and text descriptions across ten biomedical imaging modalities. Extensive validation on 70 internal and 14 external datasets demonstrated the state-of-the-art performance of UniBiomed in diverse biomedical tasks, including image segmentation, disease recognition, region-aware diagnosis, vision question answering, and report generation. In summary, UniBiomed is a powerful and versatile biomedical foundation model, unlocking the untapped grounded interpretation capability for optimizing AI-assisted biomedical image analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>A uni...</summary><p>A universal foundation model for grounded biomedical image interpretation</p></details> |

We propose a simple and effective prototype-driven framework that leverages vision-language alignment to improve region discovery under weak supervision. Our method integrates CoOp-style learnable prompt tuning to generate text-based prototypes and combines them with learnable image prototypes, forming a dual-modal prototype bank that captures both semantic and appearance cues. To address oversmoothing in ViT representations, we incorporate a multi-scale pyramid module that enhances spatial precision and improves localization quality. Experiments on the BCSS-WSSS benchmark show that our approach surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, and detailed analyses demonstrate the benefits of text description diversity, context length, and the complementary behavior of text and image prototypes. These results highlight the effectiveness of jointly leveraging textual semantics and visual prototype learning for WSSS in digital pathology.</p></details> |  |

However, existing SSL approaches for multi-modal medical imaging often struggle to exploit the complementary information between modalities due to semantic discrepancies and misalignment across MRI sequences. To address this, we propose a novel semi-supervised multi-modal framework that explicitly enhances modality-specific representations and facilitates adaptive cross-modal information fusion. Specifically, we introduce a Modality-specific Enhancing Module (MEM) to strengthen semantic cues unique to each modality via channel-wise attention, and a learnable Complementary Information Fusion (CIF) module to adaptively exchange complementary knowledge between modalities. The overall framework is optimized using a hybrid objective combining supervised segmentation loss and cross-modal consistency regularization on unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2019 (HGG subset) demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms strong semi-supervised and multi-modal baselines under 1\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data settings, achieving significant improvements in both Dice and Sensitivity scores. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary effects of our proposed MEM and CIF in bridging cross-modality discrepancies and improving segmentation robustness under scarce supervision.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |

However, existing IIS methods, primarily designed for natural images, struggle to generalize to remote sensing domains due to limited annotated data and computational overhead. To address these challenges, we proposed RS-ISRefiner, a novel click-based IIS framework tailored for remote sensing images. The framework employs an adapter-based tuning strategy that preserves the general representations of Vision Foundation Models while enabling efficient learning of remote sensing-specific spatial and boundary characteristics. A hybrid attention mechanism integrating convolutional local modeling with Transformer-based global reasoning enhances robustness against scale diversity and scene complexity. Furthermore, an improved probability map modulation scheme effectively incorporates historical user interactions, yielding more stable iterative refinement and higher boundary accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on six remote sensing datasets, including iSAID, ISPRS Potsdam, SandBar, NWPU, LoveDA Urban and WHUBuilding, demonstrate that RS-ISRefiner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art IIS methods in terms of segmentation accuracy, efficiency and interaction cost.

This paper evaluates strong data augmentation, one of the most important components for self-supervised contrastive learning's improved performance. Strong data augmentation involves applying the composition of multiple augmentation techniques on images. Surprisingly, we find that the existing data augmentations do not always improve performance for semantic segmentation for medical images.

We extend causal attribution frameworks to high-dimensional segmentation tasks, quantifying how acquisition protocols and annotation variability independently contribute to performance degradation. We model the data-generating process through a causal graph and employ Shapley values to fairly attribute performance changes to individual mechanisms. Our framework addresses unique challenges in medical imaging: high-dimensional outputs, limited samples, and complex mechanism interactions. Validation on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation across 4 centers and 7 annotators reveals context-dependent failure modes: annotation protocol shifts dominate when crossing annotators (7.4% $\pm$ 8.9% DSC attribution), while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers (6.5% $\pm$ 9.1%). This mechanism-specific quantification enables practitioners to prioritize targeted interventions based on deployment context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Imaging meets EurIPS Workshop: MedEurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accelerated Rotation-Invariant Convolution for UAV Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08888v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotation invariance is essential for precise, object-level segmentation in UAV aerial imagery, where targets can have arbitrary orientations and exhibit fine-scale details. Conventional segmentation architectures like U-Net rely on convolution operators that are not rotation-invariant, leading to degraded segmentation accuracy across varying viewpoints. Rotation invariance can be achieved by expanding the filter bank across multiple orientations; however, this will significantly increase computational cost and memory traffic. In this paper, we introduce a GPU-optimized rotation-invariant convolution framework that eliminates the traditional data-lowering (im2col) step required for matrix-multiplication-based convolution. By exploiting structured data sharing among symmetrically rotated filters, our method achieves multi-orientation convolution with greatly reduced memory traffic and computational redundancy. We further generalize the approach to accelerate convolution with arbitrary (non-symmetric) rotation angles. Across extensive benchmarks, the proposed convolution achieves 20--55% faster training and 15--45% lower energy consumption than CUDNN, while maintaining accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art rotation-invariant methods. In the eight-orientation setting, our approach achieves up to 45% speedup and 41% energy savings on 256\(\times\)256 inputs, and 32% speedup and 23% lower energy usage on 1024\(\times\)1024 inputs. Integrated into a U-Net segmentation model, the framework yields up to 6% improvement in accuracy over the non-rotation-aware baseline. These results demonstrate that the proposed method provides an effective and highly efficient alternative to existing rotation-invariant CNN frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Missing Point in Vision Transformers for Universal Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19795v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation remains a challenging task in computer vision, demanding robust mask generation and precise classification. Recent mask-based approaches yield high-quality masks by capturing global context. However, accurately classifying these masks, especially in the presence of ambiguous boundaries and imbalanced class distributions, remains an open challenge. In this work, we introduce ViT-P, a novel two-stage segmentation framework that decouples mask generation from classification. The first stage employs a proposal generator to produce class-agnostic mask proposals, while the second stage utilizes a point-based classification model built on the Vision Transformer (ViT) to refine predictions by focusing on mask central points. ViT-P serves as a pre-training-free adapter, allowing the integration of various pre-trained vision transformers without modifying their architecture, ensuring adaptability to dense prediction tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that coarse and bounding box annotations can effectively enhance classification without requiring additional training on fine annotation datasets, reducing annotation costs while maintaining strong performance. Extensive experiments across COCO, ADE20K, and Cityscapes datasets validate the effectiveness of ViT-P, achieving state-of-the-art results with 54.0 PQ on ADE20K panoptic segmentation, 87.4 mIoU on Cityscapes semantic segmentation, and 63.6 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation.

| **[Tyche: Stochastic In-Context Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13650v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing learning-based solutions to medical image segmentation have two important shortcomings. First, for most new segmentation task, a new model has to be trained or fine-tuned. This requires extensive resources and machine learning expertise, and is therefore often infeasible for medical researchers and clinicians. Second, most existing segmentation methods produce a single deterministic segmentation mask for a given image. In practice however, there is often considerable uncertainty about what constitutes the correct segmentation, and different expert annotators will often segment the same image differently. We tackle both of these problems with Tyche, a model that uses a context set to generate stochastic predictions for previously unseen tasks without the need to retrain. Tyche differs from other in-context segmentation methods in two important ways. (1) We introduce a novel convolution block architecture that enables interactions among predictions. (2) We introduce in-context test-time augmentation, a new mechanism to provide prediction stochasticity. When combined with appropriate model design and loss functions, Tyche can predict a set of plausible diverse segmentation candidates for new or unseen medical images and segmentation tasks without the need to retrain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE / CVF Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR) 2024 as a highlight.

Yet, these models often rely on relaxed Bayesian assumptions, omitting critical uncertainty information needed for robust decision-making. Despite growing interest in probabilistic segmentation to address point-estimate limitations, the research landscape remains fragmented. In response, this review synthesizes foundational concepts in uncertainty modeling, analyzing how feature- and parameter-distribution modeling impact four key segmentation tasks: Observer Variability, Active Learning, Model Introspection, and Model Generalization. Our work establishes a common framework by standardizing theory, notation, and terminology, thereby bridging the gap between method developers, task specialists, and applied researchers. We then discuss critical challenges, including the nuanced distinction between uncertainty types, strong assumptions in spatial aggregation, the lack of standardized benchmarks, and pitfalls in current quantification methods. We identify promising avenues for future research, such as uncertainty-aware active learning, data-driven benchmarks, transformer-based models, and novel techniques to move from simple segmentation problems to uncertainty in holistic scene understanding. Based on our analysis, we offer practical guidelines for researchers on method selection, evaluation, reproducibility, and meaningful uncertainty estimation. Ultimately, our goal is to facilitate the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable segmentation models that can be confidently deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> | TMLR |

The proposed approach incorporates physical priors, an edge detector and a mean curvature term, into a modified Cahn-Hilliard equation, aiming to combine the interpretability and boundary-smoothing advantages of variational partial differential equations (PDEs) with the strong representational ability of deep neural networks. The architecture consists of two collaborative modules: an F module, which conducts efficient frequency domain preprocessing to alleviate poor local minima, and a T module, which ensures accurate and stable local computations, backed by a stability estimate. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves a balanced trade-off between performance and computational efficiency, which yields competitive quantitative results and improved visual quality compared to pure convolutional neural network (CNN) based models, while achieving performance close to that of transformer-based method with reasonable computational expense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clinical Interpretability of Deep Learning Segmentation Through Shapley-Derived Agreement and Uncertainty Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07224v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation is the identification of anatomical regions of interest, such as organs, tissue, and lesions, serving as a fundamental task in computer-aided diagnosis in medical imaging. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable performance in medical image segmentation, the need for explainability remains critical for ensuring their acceptance and integration in clinical practice, despite the growing research attention in this area. Our approach explored the use of contrast-level Shapley values, a systematic perturbation of model inputs to assess feature importance. While other studies have investigated gradient-based techniques through identifying influential regions in imaging inputs, Shapley values offer a broader, clinically aligned approach, explaining how model performance is fairly attributed to certain imaging contrasts over others. Using the BraTS 2024 dataset, we generated rankings for Shapley values for four MRI contrasts across four model architectures. Two metrics were proposed from the Shapley ranking: agreement between model and ``clinician" imaging ranking, and uncertainty quantified through Shapley ranking variance across cross-validation folds. Higher-performing cases (Dice \textgreater0.6) showed significantly greater agreement with clinical rankings. Increased Shapley ranking variance correlated with decreased performance (U-Net: $r=-0.581$). These metrics provide clinically interpretable proxies for model reliability, helping clinicians better understand state-of-the-art segmentation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefLSM: Linearized Structural-Prior Reflectance Model for Medical Image Segmentation and Bias-Field Correction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07191v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation remains challenging due to intensity inhomogeneity, noise, blurred boundaries, and irregular structures. Traditional level set methods, while effective in certain cases, often depend on approximate bias field estimations and therefore struggle under severe non-uniform imaging conditions. To address these limitations, we propose a novel variational Reflectance-based Level Set Model (RefLSM), which explicitly integrates Retinex-inspired reflectance decomposition into the segmentation framework. By decomposing the observed image into reflectance and bias field components, RefLSM directly segments the reflectance, which is invariant to illumination and preserves fine structural details. Building on this foundation, we introduce two key innovations for enhanced precision and robustness. First, a linear structural prior steers the smoothed reflectance gradients toward a data-driven reference, providing reliable geometric guidance in noisy or low-contrast scenes. Second, a relaxed binary level-set is embedded in RefLSM and enforced via convex relaxation and sign projection, yielding stable evolution and avoiding reinitialization-induced diffusion. The resulting variational problem is solved efficiently using an ADMM-based optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on multiple medical imaging datasets demonstrate that RefLSM achieves superior segmentation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to state-of-the-art level set methods.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we present DAUNet, a novel lightweight UNet variant that integrates Deformable V2 Convolutions and Parameter-Free Attention (SimAM) to improve spatial adaptability and context-aware feature fusion without increasing model complexity. DAUNet's bottleneck employs dynamic deformable kernels to handle geometric variations, while the decoder and skip pathways are enhanced using SimAM attention modules for saliency-aware refinement. Extensive evaluations on two challenging datasets, FH-PS-AoP (fetal head and pubic symphysis ultrasound) and FUMPE (CT-based pulmonary embolism detection), demonstrate that DAUNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in Dice score, HD95, and ASD, while maintaining superior parameter efficiency. Ablation studies highlight the individual contributions of deformable convolutions and SimAM attention. DAUNet's robustness to missing context and low-contrast regions establishes its suitability for deployment in real-time and resource-constrained clinical environments.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Can We Go Beyond Visual Features? Neural Tissue Relation Modeling for Relational Graph Analysis in Non-Melanoma Skin Histology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06949v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Histopathology image segmentation is essential for delineating tissue structures in skin cancer diagnostics, but modeling spatial context and inter-tissue relationships remains a challenge, especially in regions with overlapping or morphologically similar tissues. Current convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approaches operate primarily on visual texture, often treating tissues as independent regions and failing to encode biological context. To this end, we introduce Neural Tissue Relation Modeling (NTRM), a novel segmentation framework that augments CNNs with a tissue-level graph neural network to model spatial and functional relationships across tissue types. NTRM constructs a graph over predicted regions, propagates contextual information via message passing, and refines segmentation through spatial projection. Unlike prior methods, NTRM explicitly encodes inter-tissue dependencies, enabling structurally coherent predictions in boundary-dense zones. On the benchmark Histopathology Non-Melanoma Skin Cancer Segmentation Dataset, NTRM outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving a robust Dice similarity coefficient that is 4.9\% to 31.25\% higher than the best-performing models among the evaluated approaches. Our experiments indicate that relational modeling offers a principled path toward more context-aware and interpretable histological segmentation, compared to local receptive-field architectures that lack tissue-level structural awareness.

To address these problems, we present a pipeline that integrates the conditional diffusion model for lymph node generation and the nnU-Net model for lymph node segmentation to improve the segmentation performance of abdominal lymph nodes through synthesizing a diversity of realistic abdominal lymph node data. We propose LN-DDPM, a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for lymph node (LN) generation. LN-DDPM utilizes lymph node masks and anatomical structure masks as model conditions. These conditions work in two conditioning mechanisms: global structure conditioning and local detail conditioning, to distinguish between lymph nodes and their surroundings and better capture lymph node characteristics. The obtained paired abdominal lymph node images and masks are used for the downstream segmentation task. Experimental results on the abdominal lymph node datasets demonstrate that LN-DDPM outperforms other generative methods in the abdominal lymph node image synthesis and better assists the downstream abdominal lymph node segmentation task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Omni-Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06862v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel task termed Omni-Referring Image Segmentation (OmniRIS) towards highly generalized image segmentation. Compared with existing unimodally conditioned segmentation tasks, such as RIS and visual RIS, OmniRIS supports the input of text instructions and reference images with masks, boxes or scribbles as omni-prompts. This property makes it can well exploit the intrinsic merits of both text and visual modalities, i.e., granular attribute referring and uncommon object grounding, respectively. Besides, OmniRIS can also handle various segmentation settings, such as one v.s. many and many v.s. many, further facilitating its practical use. To promote the research of OmniRIS, we also rigorously design and construct a large dataset termed OmniRef, which consists of 186,939 omni-prompts for 30,956 images, and establish a comprehensive evaluation system. Moreover, a strong and general baseline termed OmniSegNet is also proposed to tackle the key challenges of OmniRIS, such as omni-prompt encoding. The extensive experiments not only validate the capability of OmniSegNet in following omni-modal instructions, but also show the superiority of OmniRIS for highly generalized image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Two prominent approaches in SSL include contrastive-based learning and self-distillation utilizing cropping augmentation. Lately, masked image modeling (MIM) has emerged as a more potent SSL technique, employing image inpainting as a pretext task. MIM creates a strong inductive bias toward meaningful spatial and semantic understanding. This has opened up new opportunities for SSL to contribute not only to classification tasks but also to more complex applications like object detection and image segmentation. Building upon this progress, our research paper introduces a scalable and practical SSL approach centered around more challenging pretext tasks that facilitate the acquisition of robust features. Specifically, we leverage multi-scale image reconstruction from randomly masked input images as the foundation for feature learning. Our hypothesis posits that reconstructing high-resolution images enables the model to attend to finer spatial details, particularly beneficial for discerning subtle intricacies within medical images. The proposed SSL features help improve classification performance on the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) dataset. In pathology classification, our method demonstrates a 3\% increase in average precision (AP) and a 1\% increase in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) when compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. Moreover, in mass margins classification, our approach achieves a 4\% increase in AP and a 2\% increase in AUC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging spatial awareness and global context in medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06560v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is a fundamental task in computer-aided diagnosis, requiring models that balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. However, existing segmentation models often struggle to effectively capture local and global contextual information, leading to boundary pixel loss and segmentation errors. In this paper, we propose U-CycleMLP, a novel U-shaped encoder-decoder network designed to enhance segmentation performance while maintaining a lightweight architecture. The encoder learns multiscale contextual features using position attention weight excitation blocks, dense atrous blocks, and downsampling operations, effectively capturing both local and global contextual information. The decoder reconstructs high-resolution segmentation masks through upsampling operations, dense atrous blocks, and feature fusion mechanisms, ensuring precise boundary delineation. To further refine segmentation predictions, channel CycleMLP blocks are incorporated into the decoder along the skip connections, enhancing feature integration while maintaining linear computational complexity relative to input size. Experimental results, both quantitative and qualitative, across three benchmark datasets demonstrate the competitive performance of U-CycleMLP in comparison with state-of-the-art methods, achieving better segmentation accuracy across all datasets, capturing fine-grained anatomical structures, and demonstrating robustness across different medical imaging modalities. Ablation studies further highlight the importance of the model's core architectural components in enhancing segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Although recent deep learning (DL) based unsupervised SQA methods show potential, they often suffer from coarse evaluation granularity, incomplete assessments, and poor transferability. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces Panoramic Quality Mapping (PQM) as a new paradigm for comprehensive, pixel-wise SQA, and presents SegAssess, a novel deep learning framework realizing this approach. SegAssess distinctively formulates SQA as a fine-grained, four-class panoramic segmentation task, classifying pixels within a segmentation mask under evaluation into true positive (TP), false positive (FP), true negative (TN), and false negative (FN) categories, thereby generating a complete quality map. Leveraging an enhanced Segment Anything Model (SAM) architecture, SegAssess uniquely employs the input mask as a prompt for effective feature integration via cross-attention. Key innovations include an Edge Guided Compaction (EGC) branch with an Aggregated Semantic Filter (ASF) module to refine predictions near challenging object edges, and an Augmented Mixup Sampling (AMS) training strategy integrating multi-source masks to significantly boost cross-domain robustness and zero-shot transferability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that SegAssess achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and exhibits remarkable zero-shot transferability to unseen masks.

First, the Adaptive Cross-Fusion Attention (ACFA) module integrates channel feature enhancement with spatial attention mechanisms and introduces learnable guidance in three directions (planar, horizontal, and vertical) to enhance responsiveness to key regions and structural orientations. Second, the Triple Feature Fusion Attention (TFFA) module fuses features from Spatial, Fourier and Wavelet domains, achieving joint frequency-spatial representation that strengthens global dependency and structural modeling while preserving local information such as edges and textures, making it particularly effective in complex and blurred boundary scenarios. Finally, the Structural-aware Multi-scale Masking Module (SMMM) optimizes the skip connections between encoder and decoder by leveraging multi-scale context and structural saliency filtering, effectively reducing feature redundancy and improving semantic interaction quality. Working synergistically, these modules not only address the shortcomings of traditional decoders but also significantly enhance performance in high-precision tasks such as tumor segmentation and organ boundary extraction, improving both segmentation accuracy and model generalization. Experimental results demonstrate that this framework provides an efficient and practical solution for medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We retrospectively collected 483 examination datasets acquired between March 2011 and May 2024, involving 220 patients (106 non-Hodgkin lymphoma, 42 Hodgkin lymphoma); all data underwent ethical review and were rigorously de-identified. Complete 3D structural information was preserved during data acquisition, preprocessing and annotation, and a high-quality dataset was constructed based on the nnUNet format. By systematic technical validation and evaluation of the preprocessing process, annotation quality and automatic segmentation algorithm, the deep learning model trained based on this dataset is verified to achieve accurate segmentation of lymphoma lesions in PET/CT images with high accuracy, good robustness and reproducibility, which proves the applicability and stability of this dataset in accurate segmentation and quantitative analysis. The deep fusion of PET/CT images achieved with this dataset not only significantly improves the accurate portrayal of the morphology, location and metabolic features of tumour lesions, but also provides solid data support for early diagnosis, clinical staging and personalized treatment, and promotes the development of automated image segmentation and precision medicine based on deep learning.

We explain why the expertise in prompt-based segmentation of SAM2 does not transfer to the multimodal concept-driven paradigm of SAM3. SAM2 operates through spatial prompts points, boxes, and masks yielding purely geometric and temporal segmentation. In contrast, SAM3 introduces a unified vision-language architecture capable of open-vocabulary reasoning, semantic grounding, contrastive alignment, and exemplar-based concept understanding. We structure this analysis through five core components: (1) a Conceptual Break Between Prompt-Based and Concept-Based Segmentation, contrasting spatial prompt semantics of SAM2 with multimodal fusion and text-conditioned mask generation of SAM3; (2) Architectural Divergence, detailing pure vision-temporal design of SAM2 versus integration of vision-language encoders, geometry and exemplar encoders, fusion modules, DETR-style decoders, object queries, and ambiguity-handling via Mixture-of-Experts in SAM3; (3) Dataset and Annotation Differences, contrasting SA-V video masks with multimodal concept-annotated corpora of SAM3; (4) Training and Hyperparameter Distinctions, showing why SAM2 optimization knowledge does not apply to SAM3; and (5) Evaluation, Metrics, and Failure Modes, outlining the transition from geometric IoU metrics to semantic, open-vocabulary evaluation. Together, these analyses establish SAM3 as a new class of segmentation foundation model and chart future directions for the emerging concept-driven segmentation era.</p></details> |  |

It has demonstrated strong generative capabilities and attracted significant attention as a simulation-free flow-based framework capable of learning exact data densities. Motivated by these advances, we propose LatentFM, a flow-based model operating in the latent space for medical image segmentation. To model the data distribution, we first design two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to encode both medical images and their corresponding masks into a lower-dimensional latent space. We then estimate a conditional velocity field that guides the flow based on the input image. By sampling multiple latent representations, our method synthesizes diverse segmentation outputs whose pixel-wise variance reliably captures the underlying data distribution, enabling both highly accurate and uncertainty-aware predictions. Furthermore, we generate confidence maps that quantify the model certainty, providing clinicians with richer information for deeper analysis. We conduct experiments on two datasets, ISIC-2018 and CVC-Clinic, and compare our method with several prior baselines, including both deterministic and generative approach models. Through comprehensive evaluations, both qualitative and quantitative results show that our approach achieves superior segmentation accuracy while remaining highly efficient in the latent space.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boundary-Aware Test-Time Adaptation for Zero-Shot Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04520v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the scarcity of annotated data and the substantial computational costs of model, conventional tuning methods in medical image segmentation face critical challenges. Current approaches to adapting pretrained models, including full-parameter and parameter-efficient fine-tuning, still rely heavily on task-specific training on downstream tasks. Therefore, zero-shot segmentation has gained increasing attention, especially with foundation models such as SAM demonstrating promising generalization capabilities. However, SAM still faces notable limitations on medical datasets due to domain shifts, making efficient zero-shot enhancement an urgent research goal. To address these challenges, we propose BA-TTA-SAM, a task-agnostic test-time adaptation framework that significantly enhances the zero-shot segmentation performance of SAM via test-time adaptation. This framework integrates two key mechanisms: (1) The encoder-level Gaussian prompt injection embeds Gaussian-based prompts directly into the image encoder, providing explicit guidance for initial representation learning. (2) The cross-layer boundary-aware attention alignment exploits the hierarchical feature interactions within the ViT backbone, aligning deep semantic responses with shallow boundary cues. Experiments on four datasets, including ISIC, Kvasir, BUSI, and REFUGE, show an average improvement of 12.4\% in the DICE score compared with SAM's zero-shot segmentation performance. The results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in medical image segmentation. Our framework significantly enhances the generalization ability of SAM, without requiring any source-domain training data. Extensive experiments on publicly available medical datasets strongly demonstrate the superiority of our framework. Our code is available at https://github.com/Emilychenlin/BA-TTA-SAM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Average Calibration Losses for Reliable Uncertainty in Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03942v3)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks for medical image segmentation are often overconfident, compromising both reliability and clinical utility. In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows.

COLER first uses our developed CutOnce to generate coarse pseudo labels, then enables the detector to learn from these masks. CutOnce applies Normalized Cut (NCut) only once and does not rely on any clustering methods (e.g., K-Means), but it can generate multiple object masks in an image. Our work opens a new direction for NCut algorithm in multi-object segmentation. We have designed several novel yet simple modules that not only allow CutOnce to fully leverage the object discovery capabilities of self-supervised model, but also free it from reliance on mask post-processing. During training, COLER achieves strong performance without requiring specially designed loss functions for pseudo labels, and its performance is further improved through self-training. COLER is a zero-shot unsupervised model that outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on multiple benchmarks. We believe our method can help advance the field of unsupervised object localization. Code is available at: https://github.com/Quantumcraft616/COLER.</p></details> |  |

However, existing HTD methods are developed based on per-pixel binary classification, neglecting the three-dimensional cube structure of hyperspectral images (HSIs) that integrates both spatial and spectral dimensions. The synergistic existence of spatial and spectral features in HSIs enable objects to simultaneously exhibit both, yet the per-pixel HTD framework limits the joint expression of these features. In this paper, we rethink HTD from the perspective of spatial-spectral synergistic representation and propose hyperspectral point object detection as an innovative task framework. We introduce SpecDETR, the first specialized network for hyperspectral multi-class point object detection, which eliminates dependence on pre-trained backbone networks commonly required by vision-based object detectors. SpecDETR uses a multi-layer Transformer encoder with self-excited subpixel-scale attention modules to directly extract deep spatial-spectral joint features from hyperspectral cubes. We develop a simulated hyperspectral point object detection benchmark termed SPOD, and for the first time, evaluate and compare the performance of visual object detection networks and HTD methods on hyperspectral point object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SpecDETR outperforms SOTA visual object detection networks and HTD methods.

| **[DOS: Distilling Observable Softmaps of Zipfian Prototypes for Self-Supervised Point Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11465v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in self-supervised learning (SSL) have shown tremendous potential for learning 3D point cloud representations without human annotations. However, SSL for 3D point clouds still faces critical challenges due to irregular geometry, shortcut-prone reconstruction, and unbalanced semantics distribution. In this work, we propose DOS (Distilling Observable Softmaps), a novel SSL framework that self-distills semantic relevance softmaps only at observable (unmasked) points. This strategy prevents information leakage from masked regions and provides richer supervision than discrete token-to-prototype assignments. To address the challenge of unbalanced semantics in an unsupervised setting, we introduce Zipfian prototypes and incorporate them using a modified Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, Zipf-Sinkhorn, which enforces a power-law prior over prototype usage and modulates the sharpness of the target softmap during training. DOS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods on semantic segmentation and 3D object detection across multiple benchmarks, including nuScenes, Waymo, SemanticKITTI, ScanNet, and ScanNet200, without relying on extra data or annotations. Our results demonstrate that observable-point softmaps distillation offers a scalable and effective paradigm for learning robust 3D representations.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |
| **[Assisted Refinement Network Based on Channel Information Interaction for Camouflaged and Salient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11369v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) stands as a significant challenge in computer vision, dedicated to identifying and segmenting objects visually highly integrated with their backgrounds. Current mainstream methods have made progress in cross-layer feature fusion, but two critical issues persist during the decoding stage. The first is insufficient cross-channel information interaction within the same-layer features, limiting feature expressiveness. The second is the inability to effectively co-model boundary and region information, making it difficult to accurately reconstruct complete regions and sharp boundaries of objects. To address the first issue, we propose the Channel Information Interaction Module (CIIM), which introduces a horizontal-vertical integration mechanism in the channel dimension. This module performs feature reorganization and interaction across channels to effectively capture complementary cross-channel information. To address the second issue, we construct a collaborative decoding architecture guided by prior knowledge. This architecture generates boundary priors and object localization maps through Boundary Extraction (BE) and Region Extraction (RE) modules, then employs hybrid attention to collaboratively calibrate decoded features, effectively overcoming semantic ambiguity and imprecise boundaries. Additionally, the Multi-scale Enhancement (MSE) module enriches contextual feature representations. Extensive experiments on four COD benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of the proposed model. We further transferred our model to the Salient Object Detection (SOD) task and demonstrated its adaptability across downstream tasks, including polyp segmentation, transparent object detection, and industrial and road defect detection. Code and experimental results are publicly available at: https://github.com/akuan1234/ARNet-v2.</p></details> | 15 pages, 9 figures |

This paper addresses the detection of rice seedlings in paddy fields by leveraging a Faster R-CNN architecture initialized via transfer learning. To overcome the specific difficulties of detecting minute objects in high-resolution aerial imagery, we curate a significant UAV dataset for training and rigorously evaluate the model's generalization capabilities. Specifically, we validate performance across three distinct test sets acquired at different temporal intervals, thereby assessing robustness against varying imaging conditions. Our empirical results demonstrate that transfer learning not only facilitates the rapid convergence of object detection models in agricultural contexts but also yields consistent performance despite domain shifts in image acquisition.</p></details> |  |
| **[VGent: Visual Grounding via Modular Design for Disentangling Reasoning and Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11099v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current visual grounding models are either based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) that performs auto-regressive decoding, which is slow and risks hallucinations, or on re-aligning an LLM with vision features to learn new special or object tokens for grounding, which may undermine the LLM's pretrained reasoning ability. In contrast, we propose VGent, a modular encoder-decoder architecture that explicitly disentangles high-level reasoning and low-level bounding box prediction. Specifically, a frozen MLLM serves as the encoder to provide untouched powerful reasoning capabilities, while a decoder takes high-quality boxes proposed by detectors as queries and selects target box(es) via cross-attending on encoder's hidden states. This design fully leverages advances in both object detection and MLLM, avoids the pitfalls of auto-regressive decoding, and enables fast inference. Moreover, it supports modular upgrades of both the encoder and decoder to benefit the whole system: we introduce (i) QuadThinker, an RL-based training paradigm for enhancing multi-target reasoning ability of the encoder; (ii) mask-aware label for resolving detection-segmentation ambiguity; and (iii) global target recognition to improve the recognition of all the targets which benefits the selection among augmented proposals. Experiments on multi-target visual grounding benchmarks show that VGent achieves a new state-of-the-art with +20.6% F1 improvement over prior methods, and further boosts gIoU by +8.2% and cIoU by +5.8% under visual reference challenges, while maintaining constant, fast inference latency.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Salient Object Detection in Complex Weather Conditions via Noise Indicators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10592v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Salient object detection (SOD), a foundational task in computer vision, has advanced from single-modal to multi-modal paradigms to enhance generalization. However, most existing SOD methods assume low-noise visual conditions, overlooking the degradation of segmentation accuracy caused by weather-induced noise in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a SOD framework tailored for diverse weather conditions, encompassing a specific encoder and a replaceable decoder. To enable handling of varying weather noises, we introduce a one-hot vector as a noise indicator to represent different weather types and design a Noise Indicator Fusion Module (NIFM). The NIFM takes both semantic features and the noise indicator as dual inputs and is inserted between consecutive stages of the encoder to embed weather-aware priors via adaptive feature modulation. Critically, the proposed specific encoder retains compatibility with mainstream SOD decoders. Extensive experiments are conducted on the WXSOD dataset under varying training data scales (100%, 50%, 30% of the full training set), three encoder and seven decoder configurations. Results show that the proposed SOD framework (particularly the NIFM-enhanced specific encoder) improves segmentation accuracy under complex weather conditions compared to a vanilla encoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network with Sinusoidal Encoding for Robust Human Action Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00752v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate temporal segmentation of human actions is critical for intelligent robots in collaborative settings, where a precise understanding of sub-activity labels and their temporal structure is essential. However, the inherent noise in both human pose estimation and object detection often leads to over-segmentation errors, disrupting the coherence of action sequences. To address this, we propose a Multi-Modal Graph Convolutional Network (MMGCN) that integrates low-frame-rate (e.g., 1 fps) visual data with high-frame-rate (e.g., 30 fps) motion data (skeleton and object detections) to mitigate fragmentation. Our framework introduces three key contributions. First, a sinusoidal encoding strategy that maps 3D skeleton coordinates into a continuous sin-cos space to enhance spatial representation robustness. Second, a temporal graph fusion module that aligns multi-modal inputs with differing resolutions via hierarchical feature aggregation, Third, inspired by the smooth transitions inherent to human actions, we design SmoothLabelMix, a data augmentation technique that mixes input sequences and labels to generate synthetic training examples with gradual action transitions, enhancing temporal consistency in predictions and reducing over-segmentation artifacts. Extensive experiments on the Bimanual Actions Dataset, a public benchmark for human-object interaction understanding, demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, especially in action segmentation accuracy, achieving F1@10: 94.5% and F1@25: 92.8%.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, accepted in IROS25, Hangzhou, China</p></details> |

In this work, we introduce an interpretable network for the MMIF task, named FNet, based on an $\ell_0$-regularized multi-modal convolutional sparse coding (MCSC) model. Specifically, for solving the $\ell_0$-regularized CSC problem, we design a learnable $\ell_0$-regularized sparse coding (LZSC) block in a principled manner through deep unfolding. Given different modality source images, FNet first separates the unique and common features from them using the LZSC block and then these features are combined to generate the final fused image. Additionally, we propose an $\ell_0$-regularized MCSC model for the inverse fusion process. Based on this model, we introduce an interpretable inverse fusion network named IFNet, which is utilized during FNet's training. Extensive experiments show that FNet achieves high-quality fusion results across eight different MMIF datasets. Furthermore, we show that FNet enhances downstream object detection \textcolor[rgb]{ 0, 0, 0}{and semantic segmentation} in visible-thermal image pairs. We have also visualized the intermediate results of FNet, which demonstrates the good interpretability of our network.

| **[SCAN: Semantic Document Layout Analysis for Textual and Visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14381v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs), rich document analysis technologies for applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and visual RAG are gaining significant attention. Recent research indicates that using VLMs yields better RAG performance, but processing rich documents remains a challenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this paper, we present SCAN (SemantiC Document Layout ANalysis), a novel approach that enhances both textual and visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that work with visually rich documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that divides documents into coherent regions covering contiguous components. We trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models on an annotated dataset. Our experimental results across English and Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual RAG performance by up to 9.4 points and visual RAG performance by up to 10.4 points, outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Dual-Weighted Gravitational Point Cloud Denoising Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10386v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dual-weight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house FMCW LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seeing Through the Rain: Resolving High-Frequency Conflicts in Deraining and Super-Resolution via Diffusion Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12419v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clean images are crucial for visual tasks such as small object detection, especially at high resolutions. However, real-world images are often degraded by adverse weather, and weather restoration methods may sacrifice high-frequency details critical for analyzing small objects. A natural solution is to apply super-resolution (SR) after weather removal to recover both clarity and fine structures. However, simply cascading restoration and SR struggle to bridge their inherent conflict: removal aims to remove high-frequency weather-induced noise, while SR aims to hallucinate high-frequency textures from existing details, leading to inconsistent restoration contents. In this paper, we take deraining as a case study and propose DHGM, a Diffusion-based High-frequency Guided Model for generating clean and high-resolution images. DHGM integrates pre-trained diffusion priors with high-pass filters to simultaneously remove rain artifacts and enhance structural details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DHGM achieves superior performance over existing methods, with lower costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying the Reliability of Predictions in Detection Transformers: Object-Level Calibration and Image-Level Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01782v3)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DETR and its variants have emerged as promising architectures for object detection, offering an end-to-end prediction pipeline. In practice, however, DETRs generate hundreds of predictions that far outnumber the actual objects present in an image. This raises a critical question: which of these predictions could be trusted? Addressing this concern, we provide empirical and theoretical evidence that predictions within the same image play distinct roles, resulting in varying reliability levels. Our analysis reveals that DETRs employ an optimal specialist strategy: one prediction per object is trained to be well-calibrated, while the remaining predictions are trained to suppress their foreground confidence to near zero, even when maintaining accurate localization. We show that this strategy emerges as the loss-minimizing solution to the Hungarian matching algorithm, fundamentally shaping DETRs' outputs. While selecting the well-calibrated predictions is ideal, they are unidentifiable at inference time. This means that any post-processing algorithm poses a risk of outputting a set of predictions with mixed calibration levels. Therefore, practical deployment necessitates a joint evaluation of both the model's calibration quality and the effectiveness of the post-processing algorithm. However, we demonstrate that existing metrics like average precision and expected calibration error are inadequate for this task. To address this issue, we further introduce Object-level Calibration Error (OCE): This object-centric design penalizes both retaining suppressed predictions and missed ground truth foreground objects, making OCE suitable for both evaluating models and identifying reliable prediction subsets. Finally, we present a post hoc uncertainty quantification framework that predicts per-image model accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABBSPO: Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling and Symmetric Prior based Orientation Prediction for Detecting Aerial Image Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10031v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised oriented object detection (WS-OOD) has gained attention as a cost-effective alternative to fully supervised methods, providing both efficiency and high accuracy. Among weakly supervised approaches, horizontal bounding box (HBox)-supervised OOD stands out for its ability to directly leverage existing HBox annotations while achieving the highest accuracy under weak supervision settings. This paper introduces adaptive bounding box scaling and symmetry-prior-based orientation prediction, called ABBSPO, a framework for WS-OOD. Our ABBSPO addresses limitations of previous HBox-supervised OOD methods, which compare ground truth (GT) HBoxes directly with the minimum circumscribed rectangles of predicted RBoxes, often leading to inaccurate scale estimation. To overcome this, we propose: (i) Adaptive Bounding Box Scaling (ABBS), which appropriately scales GT HBoxes to optimize for the size of each predicted RBox, ensuring more accurate scale prediction; and (ii) a Symmetric Prior Angle (SPA) loss that exploits inherent symmetry of aerial objects for self-supervised learning, resolving issues in previous methods where learning collapses when predictions for all three augmented views (original, rotated, and flipped) are consistently incorrect. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ABBSPO achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 11 figures, 8 tables, supplementary included.

| **[Hands-on Evaluation of Visual Transformers for Object Recognition and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09579v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for computer vision sometimes struggle with understanding images in a global context, as they mainly focus on local patterns. On the other hand, Vision Transformers (ViTs), inspired by models originally created for language processing, use self-attention mechanisms, which allow them to understand relationships across the entire image. In this paper, we compare different types of ViTs (pure, hierarchical, and hybrid) against traditional CNN models across various tasks, including object recognition, detection, and medical image classification. We conduct thorough tests on standard datasets like ImageNet for image classification and COCO for object detection. Additionally, we apply these models to medical imaging using the ChestX-ray14 dataset. We find that hybrid and hierarchical transformers, especially Swin and CvT, offer a strong balance between accuracy and computational resources. Furthermore, by experimenting with data augmentation techniques on medical images, we discover significant performance improvements, particularly with the Swin Transformer model. Overall, our results indicate that Vision Transformers are competitive and, in many cases, outperform traditional CNNs, especially in scenarios requiring the understanding of global visual contexts like medical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[MODA: The First Challenging Benchmark for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09489v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial object detection faces significant challenges in real-world scenarios, such as small objects and extensive background interference, which limit the performance of RGB-based detectors with insufficient discriminative information. Multispectral images (MSIs) capture additional spectral cues across multiple bands, offering a promising alternative. However, the lack of training data has been the primary bottleneck to exploiting the potential of MSIs. To address this gap, we introduce the first large-scale dataset for Multispectral Object Detection in Aerial images (MODA), which comprises 14,041 MSIs and 330,191 annotations across diverse, challenging scenarios, providing a comprehensive data foundation for this field. Furthermore, to overcome challenges inherent to aerial object detection using MSIs, we propose OSSDet, a framework that integrates spectral and spatial information with object-aware cues. OSSDet employs a cascaded spectral-spatial modulation structure to optimize target perception, aggregates spectrally related features by exploiting spectral similarities to reinforce intra-object correlations, and suppresses irrelevant background via object-aware masking. Moreover, cross-spectral attention further refines object-related representations under explicit object-aware guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OSSDet outperforms existing methods with comparable parameters and efficiency.</p></details> | 8 pages, 9 figures |

RoboCup, an international competition of fully autonomous humanoid robots, provides a uniquely challenging benchmark for such systems, culminating in the long-term goal of competing against human soccer players by 2050. This paper presents the hardware and software innovations underlying our team's victory in the RoboCup 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer Competition. On the hardware side, we introduce an adult-sized humanoid platform built with lightweight structural components, high-torque quasi-direct-drive actuators, and a specialized foot design that enables powerful in-gait kicks while preserving locomotion robustness. On the software side, we develop an integrated perception and localization framework that combines stereo vision, object detection, and landmark-based fusion to provide reliable estimates of the ball, goals, teammates, and opponents. A mid-level navigation stack then generates collision-aware, dynamically feasible trajectories, while a centralized behavior manager coordinates high-level decision making, role selection, and kick execution based on the evolving game state. The seamless integration of these subsystems results in fast, precise, and tactically effective gameplay, enabling robust performance under the dynamic and adversarial conditions of real matches. This paper presents the design principles, system architecture, and experimental results that contributed to ARTEMIS's success as the 2024 Adult-Sized Humanoid Soccer champion.</p></details> |  |

Previous solutions have made progress in explicitly modeling the dynamic obstacle motion for avoidance, but this key dependency of decision-making is time-consuming and unreliable in highly dynamic scenarios with occlusions. On the contrary, without introducing object detection, tracking, and prediction, we empower the reinforcement learning (RL) with single LiDAR sensing to realize an autonomous flight system directly from point to motion. For exteroception, a depth sensing distance map achieving fixed-shape, low-resolution, and detail-safe is encoded from raw point clouds, and an environment change sensing point flow is adopted as motion features extracted from multi-frame observations. These two are integrated into a lightweight and easy-to-learn representation of complex dynamic environments. For action generation, the behavior of avoiding dynamic threats in advance is implicitly driven by the proposed change-aware sensing representation, where the policy optimization is indicated by the relative motion modulated distance field. With the deployment-friendly sensing simulation and dynamics model-free acceleration control, the proposed system shows a superior success rate and adaptability to alternatives, and the policy derived from the simulator can drive a real-world quadrotor with safe maneuvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L), November, 2025</p></details> |

However, the time-consuming nature of the manipulation process, coupled with the sensitivity of the STM tip, constrains the exploration of diverse configurations and limits the size of designed features. In this study, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based framework for creating artificial structures by spatially manipulating carbon monoxide (CO) molecules on a copper substrate using the STM tip. The automated workflow combines molecule detection and manipulation, employing deep learning-based object detection to locate CO molecules and linear assignment algorithms to allocate these molecules to designated target sites. We initially perform molecule maneuvering based on randomized parameter sampling for sample bias, tunneling current setpoint and manipulation speed. This dataset is then structured into an action trajectory used to train an RL agent. The model is subsequently deployed on the STM for real-time fine-tuning of manipulation parameters during structure construction. Our approach incorporates path planning protocols coupled with active drift compensation to enable atomically precise fabrication of structures with significantly reduced human input while realizing larger-scale artificial lattices with desired electronic properties. Using our approach, we demonstrate the automated construction of an extended artificial graphene lattice and confirm the existence of characteristic Dirac point in its electronic structure. Further challenges to RL-based structural assembly scalability are discussed.</p></details> |  |

We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 Pa...</summary><p>22 Pages, 26 Figures, This work has been submitted to the IEEE Sensors Journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Domain-RAG: Retrieval-Guided Compositional Image Generation for Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05872v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-Domain Few-Shot Object Detection (CD-FSOD) aims to detect novel objects with only a handful of labeled samples from previously unseen domains. While data augmentation and generative methods have shown promise in few-shot learning, their effectiveness for CD-FSOD remains unclear due to the need for both visual realism and domain alignment. Existing strategies, such as copy-paste augmentation and text-to-image generation, often fail to preserve the correct object category or produce backgrounds coherent with the target domain, making them non-trivial to apply directly to CD-FSOD. To address these challenges, we propose Domain-RAG, a training-free, retrieval-guided compositional image generation framework tailored for CD-FSOD. Domain-RAG consists of three stages: domain-aware background retrieval, domain-guided background generation, and foreground-background composition. Specifically, the input image is first decomposed into foreground and background regions. We then retrieve semantically and stylistically similar images to guide a generative model in synthesizing a new background, conditioned on both the original and retrieved contexts. Finally, the preserved foreground is composed with the newly generated domain-aligned background to form the generated image. Without requiring any additional supervision or training, Domain-RAG produces high-quality, domain-consistent samples across diverse tasks, including CD-FSOD, remote sensing FSOD, and camouflaged FSOD. Extensive experiments show consistent improvements over strong baselines and establish new state-of-the-art results. Codes will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distilling Future Temporal Knowledge with Masked Feature Reconstruction for 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08247v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camera-based temporal 3D object detection has shown impressive results in autonomous driving, with offline models improving accuracy by using future frames. Knowledge distillation (KD) can be an appealing framework for transferring rich information from offline models to online models. However, existing KD methods overlook future frames, as they mainly focus on spatial feature distillation under strict frame alignment or on temporal relational distillation, thereby making it challenging for online models to effectively learn future knowledge. To this end, we propose a sparse query-based approach, Future Temporal Knowledge Distillation (FTKD), which effectively transfers future frame knowledge from an offline teacher model to an online student model. Specifically, we present a future-aware feature reconstruction strategy to encourage the student model to capture future features without strict frame alignment. In addition, we further introduce future-guided logit distillation to leverage the teacher's stable foreground and background context. FTKD is applied to two high-performing 3D object detection baselines, achieving up to 1.3 mAP and 1.3 NDS gains on the nuScenes dataset, as well as the most accurate velocity estimation, without increasing inference cost.</p></details> | AAAI-26 |

We investigate whether a model trained on the large-scale Waymo dataset can serve as a foundation model and adapt to other scenarios within the 3D object detection field. This paper sequentially examines the impact of prompt tokens and prompt generators, and further proposes a Scene-Oriented Prompt Pool (\textbf{SOP$^2$}). We demonstrate the effectiveness of prompt pools in 3D object detection, with the goal of inspiring future researchers to delve deeper into the potential of prompts in the 3D field.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an innovative AI-powered Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) system designed to overcome these limitations by automating underwater object detection, analysis, and reporting. The system integrates YOLOv12 Nano for real-time object detection, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (ResNet50) for feature extraction, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, and K-Means++ clustering for grouping marine objects based on visual characteristics. Furthermore, a Large Language Model (LLM) (GPT-4o Mini) is employed to generate structured reports and summaries of underwater findings, enhancing data interpretation. The system was trained and evaluated on a combined dataset of over 55,000 images from the DeepFish and OzFish datasets, capturing diverse Australian marine environments. Experimental results demonstrate the system's capability to detect marine objects with a mAP@0.5 of 0.512, a precision of 0.535, and a recall of 0.438. The integration of PCA effectively reduced feature dimensionality while preserving 98% variance, facilitating K-Means clustering which successfully grouped detected objects based on visual similarities. The LLM integration proved effective in generating insightful summaries of detections and clusters, supported by location data. This integrated approach significantly reduces the risks associated with human diving, increases mission efficiency, and enhances the speed and depth of underwater data analysis, paving the way for more effective scientific research and discovery in challenging marine environments.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches for detecting small objects in aerial images often involve image cropping and modifications to detector network architectures. Techniques such as sliding window cropping and architectural enhancements, including higher-resolution feature maps and attention mechanisms, are commonly employed. Given the growing importance of aerial imagery in various critical and industrial applications, the need for robust frameworks for small object detection becomes imperative. To address this need, we adopted the base SW-YOLO approach to enhance speed and accuracy in small object detection by refining cropping dimensions and overlap in sliding window usage and subsequently enhanced it through architectural modifications. we propose a novel model by modifying the base model architecture, including advanced feature extraction modules in the neck for feature map enhancement, integrating CBAM in the backbone to preserve spatial and channel information, and introducing a new head to boost small object detection accuracy. Finally, we compared our method with SAHI, one of the most powerful frameworks for processing large-scale images, and CZDet, which is also based on image cropping, achieving significant improvements in accuracy. The proposed model achieves significant accuracy gains on the VisDrone2019 dataset, outperforming baseline YOLOv5L detection by a substantial margin. Specifically, the final proposed model elevates the mAP .5.5 accuracy on the VisDrone2019 dataset from the base accuracy of 35.5 achieved by the YOLOv5L detector to 61.2. Notably, the accuracy of CZDet, which is another classic method applied to this dataset, is 58.36. This research demonstrates a significant improvement, achieving an increase in accuracy from 35.5 to 61.2.</p></details> | 22 pages, 16 figures |

These models usually require 3D point clouds from laser scanners that are expensive to acquire and require specialist knowledge to use. In this article, we present a graph generation pipeline based on photogrammetry. The pipeline detects relevant objects and predicts their relation using RGB images and depth data generated by a stereo camera. This more cost-effective approach uses deep learning for object detection and instance segmentation of the objects, and employs user-defined heuristics or rules to infer their relations. Results of two hydraulic systems show that this strategy can produce graphs close to the ground truth while its flexibility allows the method to be tailored to specific applications and its transparency qualifies it to be used in the high stakes decision-making that is required for critical infrastructures.</p></details> |  |

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes. The proposed MeViS dataset and the method's source code are publicly available at https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TPAMI, Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/</p></details> |

We propose to benchmark these high performing trackers (SAM2, EfficientTAM, DAM4SAM and SAMURAI) on datasets containing fast moving objects (FMO) specifically designed to be challenging for tracking approaches. The goal is to understand better current limitations in state-of-the-art trackers by providing more detailed insights on the behavior of these trackers. We show that overall the trackers DAM4SAM and SAMURAI perform well on more challenging sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Feature Compression for Machines with Global Statistics Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09235v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The split-inference paradigm divides an artificial intelligence (AI) model into two parts. This necessitates the transfer of intermediate feature data between the two halves. Here, effective compression of the feature data becomes vital. In this paper, we employ Z-score normalization to efficiently recover the compressed feature data at the decoder side. To examine the efficacy of our method, the proposed method is integrated into the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) codec standard under development by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Our method supersedes the existing scaling method used by the current standard under development. It both reduces the overhead bits and improves the end-task accuracy. To further reduce the overhead in certain circumstances, we also propose a simplified method. Experiments show that using our proposed method shows 17.09% reduction in bitrate on average across different tasks and up to 65.69% for object tracking without sacrificing the task accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, "in-the-wild" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation. We publicly release all code and datasets to facilitate scalable, non-invasive monitoring of endangered species</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> |
| **[How Far are Modern Trackers from UAV-Anti-UAV? A Million-Scale Benchmark and New Baseline](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07385v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer wide-ranging applications but also pose significant safety and privacy violation risks in areas like airport and infrastructure inspection, spurring the rapid development of Anti-UAV technologies in recent years. However, current Anti-UAV research primarily focuses on RGB, infrared (IR), or RGB-IR videos captured by fixed ground cameras, with little attention to tracking target UAVs from another moving UAV platform. To fill this gap, we propose a new multi-modal visual tracking task termed UAV-Anti-UAV, which involves a pursuer UAV tracking a target adversarial UAV in the video stream. Compared to existing Anti-UAV tasks, UAV-Anti-UAV is more challenging due to severe dual-dynamic disturbances caused by the rapid motion of both the capturing platform and the target. To advance research in this domain, we construct a million-scale dataset consisting of 1,810 videos, each manually annotated with bounding boxes, a language prompt, and 15 tracking attributes. Furthermore, we propose MambaSTS, a Mamba-based baseline method for UAV-Anti-UAV tracking, which enables integrated spatial-temporal-semantic learning. Specifically, we employ Mamba and Transformer models to learn global semantic and spatial features, respectively, and leverage the state space model's strength in long-sequence modeling to establish video-level long-term context via a temporal token propagation mechanism. We conduct experiments on the UAV-Anti-UAV dataset to validate the effectiveness of our method. A thorough experimental evaluation of 50 modern deep tracking algorithms demonstrates that there is still significant room for improvement in the UAV-Anti-UAV domain. The dataset and codes will be available at {\color{magenta}https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking}.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/983632847/Awesome-Multimodal-Object-Tracking</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity.

Existing approaches, however, have largely focused on the simpler setting of homogeneous, dense prediction tasks, leaving the more realistic challenge of learning from structurally diverse tasks unexplored. To this end, we introduce NexusFlow, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play framework effective in both settings. NexusFlow introduces a set of surrogate networks with invertible coupling layers to align the latent feature distributions of tasks, creating a unified representation that enables effective knowledge transfer. The coupling layers are bijective, preserving information while mapping features into a shared canonical space. This invertibility avoids representational collapse and enables alignment across structurally different tasks without reducing expressive capacity. We first evaluate NexusFlow on the core challenge of domain-partitioned autonomous driving, where dense map reconstruction and sparse multi-object tracking are supervised in different geographic regions, creating both structural disparity and a strong domain gap. NexusFlow sets a new state-of-the-art result on nuScenes, outperforming strong partially supervised baselines. To demonstrate generality, we further test NexusFlow on NYUv2 using three homogeneous dense prediction tasks, segmentation, depth, and surface normals, as a representative N-task PS-MTL scenario. NexusFlow yields consistent gains across all tasks, confirming its broad applicability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |
| **[SSP-GNN: Learning to Track via Bilevel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04308v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a graph-based tracking formulation for multi-object tracking (MOT) where target detections contain kinematic information and re-identification features (attributes). Our method applies a successive shortest paths (SSP) algorithm to a tracking graph defined over a batch of frames. The edge costs in this tracking graph are computed via a message-passing network, a graph neural network (GNN) variant. The parameters of the GNN, and hence, the tracker, are learned end-to-end on a training set of example ground-truth tracks and detections. Specifically, learning takes the form of bilevel optimization guided by our novel loss function. We evaluate our algorithm on simulated scenarios to understand its sensitivity to scenario aspects and model hyperparameters. Across varied scenario complexities, our method compares favorably to a strong baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two-Stage Camera Calibration Method for Multi-Camera Systems Using Scene Geometry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05171v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Calibration of multi-camera systems is a key task for accurate object tracking. However, it remains a challenging problem in real-world conditions, where traditional methods are not applicable due to the lack of accurate floor plans, physical access to place calibration patterns, or synchronized video streams. This paper presents a novel two-stage calibration method that overcomes these limitations. In the first stage, partial calibration of individual cameras is performed based on an operator's annotation of natural geometric primitives (parallel, perpendicular, and vertical lines, or line segments of equal length). This allows estimating key parameters (roll, pitch, focal length) and projecting the camera's Effective Field of View (EFOV) onto the horizontal plane in a base 3D coordinate system. In the second stage, precise system calibration is achieved through interactive manipulation of the projected EFOV polygons. The operator adjusts their position, scale, and rotation to align them with the floor plan or, in its absence, using virtual calibration elements projected onto all cameras in the system. This determines the remaining extrinsic parameters (camera position and yaw). Calibration requires only a static image from each camera, eliminating the need for physical access or synchronized video. The method is implemented as a practical web service. Comparative analysis and demonstration videos confirm the method's applicability, accuracy, and flexibility, enabling the deployment of precise multi-camera tracking systems in scenarios previously considered infeasible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency for Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11323v2)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Detection to Association: Learning Discriminative Object Embeddings for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02392v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-to-end multi-object tracking (MOT) methods have recently achieved remarkable progress by unifying detection and association within a single framework. Despite their strong detection performance, these methods suffer from relatively low association accuracy. Through detailed analysis, we observe that object embeddings produced by the shared DETR architecture display excessively high inter-object similarity, as it emphasizes only category-level discrimination within single frames. In contrast, tracking requires instance-level distinction across frames with spatial and temporal continuity, for which current end-to-end approaches insufficiently optimize object embeddings. To address this, we introduce FDTA (From Detection to Association), an explicit feature refinement framework that enhances object discriminativeness across three complementary perspectives. Specifically, we introduce a Spatial Adapter (SA) to integrate depth-aware cues for spatial continuity, a Temporal Adapter (TA) to aggregate historical information for temporal dependencies, and an Identity Adapter (IA) to leverage quality-aware contrastive learning for instance-level separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FDTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple challenging MOT benchmarks, including DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BFT, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed discriminative embedding enhancement strategy. The code is available at https://github.com/Spongebobbbbbbbb/FDTA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Physical ID-Transfer Attacks against Multi-Object Tracking via Adversarial Trajectory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01934v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a critical task in computer vision, with applications ranging from surveillance systems to autonomous driving. However, threats to MOT algorithms have yet been widely studied. In particular, incorrect association between the tracked objects and their assigned IDs can lead to severe consequences, such as wrong trajectory predictions. Previous attacks against MOT either focused on hijacking the trackers of individual objects, or manipulating the tracker IDs in MOT by attacking the integrated object detection (OD) module in the digital domain, which are model-specific, non-robust, and only able to affect specific samples in offline datasets. In this paper, we present AdvTraj, the first online and physical ID-manipulation attack against tracking-by-detection MOT, in which an attacker uses adversarial trajectories to transfer its ID to a targeted object to confuse the tracking system, without attacking OD. Our simulation results in CARLA show that AdvTraj can fool ID assignments with 100% success rate in various scenarios for white-box attacks against SORT, which also have high attack transferability (up to 93% attack success rate) against state-of-the-art (SOTA) MOT algorithms due to their common design principles. We characterize the patterns of trajectories generated by AdvTraj and propose two universal adversarial maneuvers that can be performed by a human walker/driver in daily scenarios. Our work reveals under-explored weaknesses in the object association phase of SOTA MOT systems, and provides insights into enhancing the robustness of such systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Annual Computer Security Applications Conference (ACSAC) 2024</p></details> |

Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms. The code is available at https://github.com/bozeklab/TransientTrack.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables.

While monitoring tasks have traditionally been carried out manually, advances in machine learning have made it possible to collect individualized information in an increasingly automated way. Central to these methods is the localization of animals across space (object detection) and time (multi-object tracking). Despite extensive research of these two tasks in pig farming, a systematic benchmarking study has not yet been conducted. In this work, we address this gap by curating two datasets: PigDetect for object detection and PigTrack for multi-object tracking. The datasets are based on diverse image and video material from realistic barn conditions, and include challenging scenarios such as occlusions or bad visibility. For object detection, we show that challenging training images improve detection performance beyond what is achievable with randomly sampled images alone. Comparing different approaches, we found that state-of-the-art models offer substantial improvements in detection quality over real-time alternatives. For multi-object tracking, we observed that SORT-based methods achieve superior detection performance compared to end-to-end trainable models. However, end-to-end models show better association performance, suggesting they could become strong alternatives in the future. We also investigate characteristic failure cases of end-to-end models, providing guidance for future improvements. The detection and tracking models trained on our datasets perform well in unseen pens, suggesting good generalization capabilities. This highlights the importance of high-quality training data. The datasets and research code are made publicly available to facilitate reproducibility, re-use and further development.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 6 figures and 8 tables</p></details> |

However, current RMOT research remains mostly confined to ground-level scenarios, which constrains their ability to capture broad-scale scene contexts and perform comprehensive tracking and path planning. In contrast, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) leverage their expansive aerial perspectives and superior maneuverability to enable wide-area surveillance. Moreover, UAVs have emerged as critical platforms for Embodied Intelligence, which has given rise to an unprecedented demand for intelligent aerial systems capable of natural language interaction. To this end, we introduce AerialMind, the first large-scale RMOT benchmark in UAV scenarios, which aims to bridge this research gap. To facilitate its construction, we develop an innovative semi-automated collaborative agent-based labeling assistant (COALA) framework that significantly reduces labor costs while maintaining annotation quality. Furthermore, we propose HawkEyeTrack (HETrack), a novel method that collaboratively enhances vision-language representation learning and improves the perception of UAV scenarios.

In this paper, we propose BlinkBud, which utilizes a single earbud and a paired phone to online detect hazardous objects approaching from behind of a user. The core idea is to accurately track visually identified objects utilizing a small number of sampled camera images taken from the earbud. To minimize the power consumption of the earbud and the phone while guaranteeing the best tracking accuracy, a novel 3D object tracking algorithm is devised, integrating both a Kalman filter based trajectory estimation scheme and an optimal image sampling strategy based on reinforcement learning. Moreover, the impact of constant user head movements on the tracking accuracy is significantly eliminated by leveraging the estimated pitch and yaw angles to correct the object depth estimation and align the camera coordinate system to the user's body coordinate system, respectively. We implement a prototype BlinkBud system and conduct extensive real-world experiments. Results show that BlinkBud is lightweight with ultra-low mean power consumptions of 29.8 mW and 702.6 mW on the earbud and smartphone, respectively, and can accurately detect hazards with a low average false positive ratio (FPR) and false negative ratio (FNR) of 4.90% and 1.47%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author-accepted version of the paper published in Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies (IMWUT), Vol. 9, No. 4, Article 191, 2025.

| **[MANTA: Physics-Informed Generalized Underwater Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23405v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater object tracking is challenging due to wavelength dependent attenuation and scattering, which severely distort appearance across depths and water conditions. Existing trackers trained on terrestrial data fail to generalize to these physics-driven degradations. We present MANTA, a physics-informed framework integrating representation learning with tracking design for underwater scenarios. We propose a dual-positive contrastive learning strategy coupling temporal consistency with Beer-Lambert augmentations to yield features robust to both temporal and underwater distortions. We further introduce a multi-stage pipeline augmenting motion-based tracking with a physics-informed secondary association algorithm that integrates geometric consistency and appearance similarity for re-identification under occlusion and drift. To complement standard IoU metrics, we propose Center-Scale Consistency (CSC) and Geometric Alignment Score (GAS) to assess geometric fidelity. Experiments on four underwater benchmarks (WebUOT-1M, UOT32, UTB180, UWCOT220) show that MANTA achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Success AUC by up to 6 percent, while ensuring stable long-term generalized underwater tracking and efficient runtime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the IEEE/CVF WACV 2026</p></details> |

In this paper, we present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear swimming patterns of fish and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios.

| **[DM$^3$T: Harmonizing Modalities via Diffusion for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22896v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is a fundamental task in computer vision with critical applications in autonomous driving and robotics. Multimodal MOT that integrates visible light and thermal infrared information is particularly essential for robust autonomous driving systems. However, effectively fusing these heterogeneous modalities is challenging. Simple strategies like concatenation or addition often fail to bridge the significant non-linear distribution gap between their feature representations, which can lead to modality conflicts and degrade tracking accuracy. Drawing inspiration from the connection between multimodal MOT and the iterative refinement in diffusion models, this paper proposes DM$^3$T, a novel framework that reformulates multimodal fusion as an iterative feature alignment process to generate accurate and temporally coherent object trajectories. Our approach performs iterative cross-modal harmonization through a proposed Cross-Modal Diffusion Fusion (C-MDF) module. In this process, features from both modalities provide mutual guidance, iteratively projecting them onto a shared, consistent feature manifold. This enables the learning of complementary information and achieves deeper fusion compared to conventional methods. Additionally, we introduce a plug-and-play Diffusion Refiner (DR) to enhance and refine the unified feature representation. To further improve tracking robustness, we design a Hierarchical Tracker that adaptively handles confidence estimation. DM$^3$T unifies object detection, state estimation, and data association into a comprehensive online tracking framework without complex post-processing. Extensive experiments on the VT-MOT benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves 41.7 HOTA, representing a 1.54% relative improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Rethinking Progression of Memory State in Robotic Manipulation: An Object-Centric Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11478v3)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As embodied agents operate in increasingly complex environments, the ability to perceive, track, and reason about individual object instances over time becomes essential, especially in tasks requiring sequenced interactions with visually similar objects. In these non-Markovian settings, key decision cues are often hidden in object-specific histories rather than the current scene. Without persistent memory of prior interactions (what has been interacted with, where it has been, or how it has changed) visuomotor policies may fail, repeat past actions, or overlook completed ones. To surface this challenge, we introduce LIBERO-Mem, a non-Markovian task suite for stress-testing robotic manipulation under object-level partial observability. It combines short- and long-horizon object tracking with temporally sequenced subgoals, requiring reasoning beyond the current frame. However, vision-language-action (VLA) models often struggle in such settings, with token scaling quickly becoming intractable even for tasks spanning just a few hundred frames. We propose Embodied-SlotSSM, a slot-centric VLA framework built for temporal scalability. It maintains spatio-temporally consistent slot identities and leverages them through two mechanisms: (1) slot-state-space modeling for reconstructing short-term history, and (2) a relational encoder to align the input tokens with action decoding. Together, these components enable temporally grounded, context-aware action prediction. Experiments show Embodied-SlotSSM's baseline performance on LIBERO-Mem and general tasks, offering a scalable solution for non-Markovian reasoning in object-centric robotic policies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Tracking the Unstable: Appearance-Guided Motion Modeling for Robust Multi-Object Tracking in UAV-Captured Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01730v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) aims to track multiple objects while maintaining consistent identities across frames of a given video. In unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) recorded videos, frequent viewpoint changes and complex UAV-ground relative motion dynamics pose significant challenges, which often lead to unstable affinity measurement and ambiguous association. Existing methods typically model motion and appearance cues separately, overlooking their spatio-temporal interplay and resulting in suboptimal tracking performance. In this work, we propose AMOT, which jointly exploits appearance and motion cues through two key components: an Appearance-Motion Consistency (AMC) matrix and a Motion-aware Track Continuation (MTC) module. Specifically, the AMC matrix computes bi-directional spatial consistency under the guidance of appearance features, enabling more reliable and context-aware identity association. The MTC module complements AMC by reactivating unmatched tracks through appearance-guided predictions that align with Kalman-based predictions, thereby reducing broken trajectories caused by missed detections. Extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks, including VisDrone2019, UAVDT, and VT-MOT-UAV, demonstrate that our AMOT outperforms current state-of-the-art methods and generalizes well in a plug-and-play and training-free manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the AAAI26 Conference Main Track</p></details> |

The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

| **[Referring Video Object Segmentation with Cross-Modality Proxy Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21139v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) is an emerging cross-modality task that aims to generate pixel-level maps of the target objects referred by given textual expressions. The main concept involves learning an accurate alignment of visual elements and language expressions within a semantic space. Recent approaches address cross-modality alignment through conditional queries, tracking the target object using a query-response based mechanism built upon transformer structure. However, they exhibit two limitations: (1) these conditional queries lack inter-frame dependency and variation modeling, making accurate target tracking challenging amid significant frame-to-frame variations; and (2) they integrate textual constraints belatedly, which may cause the video features potentially focus on the non-referred objects. Therefore, we propose a novel RVOS architecture called ProxyFormer, which introduces a set of proxy queries to integrate visual and text semantics and facilitate the flow of semantics between them. By progressively updating and propagating proxy queries across multiple stages of video feature encoder, ProxyFormer ensures that the video features are focused on the object of interest. This dynamic evolution also enables the establishment of inter-frame dependencies, enhancing the accuracy and coherence of object tracking. To mitigate high computational costs, we decouple cross-modality interactions into temporal and spatial dimensions. Additionally, we design a Joint Semantic Consistency (JSC) training strategy to align semantic consensus between the proxy queries and the combined video-text pairs. Comprehensive experiments on four widely used RVOS benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our ProxyFormer to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[V$^{2}$-SAM: Marrying SAM2 with Multi-Prompt Experts for Cross-View Object Correspondence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20886v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cross-view object correspondence, exemplified by the representative task of ego-exo object correspondence, aims to establish consistent associations of the same object across different viewpoints (e.g., ego-centric and exo-centric). This task poses significant challenges due to drastic viewpoint and appearance variations, making existing segmentation models, such as SAM2, non-trivial to apply directly. To address this, we present V^2-SAM, a unified cross-view object correspondence framework that adapts SAM2 from single-view segmentation to cross-view correspondence through two complementary prompt generators. Specifically, the Cross-View Anchor Prompt Generator (V^2-Anchor), built upon DINOv3 features, establishes geometry-aware correspondences and, for the first time, unlocks coordinate-based prompting for SAM2 in cross-view scenarios, while the Cross-View Visual Prompt Generator (V^2-Visual) enhances appearance-guided cues via a novel visual prompt matcher that aligns ego-exo representations from both feature and structural perspectives. To effectively exploit the strengths of both prompts, we further adopt a multi-expert design and introduce a Post-hoc Cyclic Consistency Selector (PCCS) that adaptively selects the most reliable expert based on cyclic consistency. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of V^2-SAM, achieving new state-of-the-art performance on Ego-Exo4D (ego-exo object correspondence), DAVIS-2017 (video object tracking), and HANDAL-X (robotic-ready cross-view correspondence).</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[StableTrack: Stabilizing Multi-Object Tracking on Low-Frequency Detections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20418v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is one of the most challenging tasks in computer vision, where it is important to correctly detect objects and associate these detections across frames. Current approaches mainly focus on tracking objects in each frame of a video stream, making it almost impossible to run the model under conditions of limited computing resources. To address this issue, we propose StableTrack, a novel approach that stabilizes the quality of tracking on low-frequency detections. Our method introduces a new two-stage matching strategy to improve the cross-frame association between low-frequency detections. We propose a novel Bbox-Based Distance instead of the conventional Mahalanobis distance, which allows us to effectively match objects using the Re-ID model. Furthermore, we integrate visual tracking into the Kalman Filter and the overall tracking pipeline. Our method outperforms current state-of-the-art trackers in the case of low-frequency detections, achieving $\textit{11.6%}$ HOTA improvement at $\textit{1}$ Hz on MOT17-val, while keeping up with the best approaches on the standard MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks with full-frequency detections.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate their self-attention maps can be reinterpreted as semantic label propagation kernels, providing robust pixel-level correspondences between relevant image regions. Extending this mechanism across frames yields a temporal propagation kernel that enables zero-shot object tracking via segmentation in videos. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of test-time optimization strategies-DDIM inversion, textual inversion, and adaptive head weighting-in adapting diffusion features for robust and consistent label propagation. Building on these findings, we introduce DRIFT, a framework for object tracking in videos leveraging a pretrained image diffusion model with SAM-guided mask refinement, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in the 4th IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (IEEE SaTML 2026).

| **[Reframing Music-Driven 2D Dance Pose Generation as Multi-Channel Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11720v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent pose-to-video models can translate 2D pose sequences into photorealistic, identity-preserving dance videos, so the key challenge is to generate temporally coherent, rhythm-aligned 2D poses from music, especially under complex, high-variance in-the-wild distributions. We address this by reframing music-to-dance generation as a music-token-conditioned multi-channel image synthesis problem: 2D pose sequences are encoded as one-hot images, compressed by a pretrained image VAE, and modeled with a DiT-style backbone, allowing us to inherit architectural and training advances from modern text-to-image models and better capture high-variance 2D pose distributions. On top of this formulation, we introduce (i) a time-shared temporal indexing scheme that explicitly synchronizes music tokens and pose latents over time and (ii) a reference-pose conditioning strategy that preserves subject-specific body proportions and on-screen scale while enabling long-horizon segment-and-stitch generation. Experiments on a large in-the-wild 2D dance corpus and the calibrated AIST++2D benchmark show consistent improvements over representative music-to-dance methods in pose- and video-space metrics and human preference, and ablations validate the contributions of the representation, temporal indexing, and reference conditioning.

| **[Free-Lunch Color-Texture Disentanglement for Stylized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14275v4)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have transformed image generation, enabling significant progress in stylized generation using only a few style reference images. However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code is released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025.

Discretizing image data into tokens is a critical step for effectively integrating images with Transformer and other architectures. Although the Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCM) pioneered the use of pre-trained diffusion models for image tokenization, it strictly relies on the traditional discrete-time DDPM architecture. Consequently, it fails to adapt to modern continuous-time variants-such as Flow Matching and Consistency Models-and suffers from inefficient sampling in high-noise regions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Generalized Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (gDDCM). We establish a unified theoretical framework and introduce a generic "De-noise and Back-trace" sampling strategy. By integrating a deterministic ODE denoising step with a residual-aligned noise injection step, our method resolves the challenge of adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce a backtracking parameter $p$ and significantly enhance tokenization ability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate that gDDCM achieves comprehensive compatibility with mainstream diffusion variants and significantly outperforms DDCM in terms of reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

In visual generation, however, these powerful core models are typically reduced to global text encoders for diffusion models, leaving most of their reasoning and planning ability unused. This creates a gap: current multimodal LLMs can parse complex layouts, attributes, and knowledge-intensive scenes, yet struggle to generate images or videos with equally precise and structured control. We propose MetaCanvas, a lightweight framework that lets MLLMs reason and plan directly in spatial and spatiotemporal latent spaces and interface tightly with diffusion generators. We empirically implement MetaCanvas on three different diffusion backbones and evaluate it across six tasks, including text-to-image generation, text/image-to-video generation, image/video editing, and in-context video generation, each requiring precise layouts, robust attribute binding, and reasoning-intensive control. MetaCanvas consistently outperforms global-conditioning baselines, suggesting that treating MLLMs as latent-space planners is a promising direction for narrowing the gap between multimodal understanding and generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://metacanvas.github.io</p></details> |
| **[ChangeBridge: Spatiotemporal Image Generation with Multimodal Controls for Remote Sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04678v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatiotemporal image generation is a highly meaningful task, which can generate future scenes conditioned on given observations. However, existing change generation methods can only handle event-driven changes (e.g., new buildings) and fail to model cross-temporal variations (e.g., seasonal shifts). In this work, we propose ChangeBridge, a conditional spatiotemporal image generation model for remote sensing. Given pre-event images and multimodal event controls, ChangeBridge generates post-event scenes that are both spatially and temporally coherent. The core idea is a drift-asynchronous diffusion bridge. Specifically, it consists of three main modules: a) Composed bridge initialization, which replaces noise initialization. It starts the diffusion from a composed pre-event state, modeling a diffusion bridge process. b) Asynchronous Drift Diffusion, which uses a pixel-wise drift map, assigning different drift magnitudes to event and temporal evolution. This enables differentiated generation during the pre-to-post transition. c) Drift-Aware Denoising, which embeds the drift map into the denoising network, guiding drift-aware reconstruction. Experiments show that ChangeBridge can generate better cross-spatiotemporal aligned scenarios compared to state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, ChangeBridge shows great potential for land-use planning and as a data generation engine for a series of change detection tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaVoxel: Joint Diffusion Modeling of Imaging and Clinical Metadata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10041v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep learning methods have achieved impressive results across tasks from disease classification, estimating continuous biomarkers, to generating realistic medical images. Most of these approaches are trained to model conditional distributions defined by a specific predictive direction with a specific set of input variables. We introduce MetaVoxel, a generative joint diffusion modeling framework that models the joint distribution over imaging data and clinical metadata by learning a single diffusion process spanning all variables. By capturing the joint distribution, MetaVoxel unifies tasks that traditionally require separate conditional models and supports flexible zero-shot inference using arbitrary subsets of inputs without task-specific retraining. Using more than 10,000 T1-weighted MRI scans paired with clinical metadata from nine datasets, we show that a single MetaVoxel model can perform image generation, age estimation, and sex prediction, achieving performance comparable to established task-specific baselines. Additional experiments highlight its capabilities for flexible inference. Together, these findings demonstrate that joint multimodal diffusion offers a promising direction for unifying medical AI models and enabling broader clinical applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFMF: World Modeling by Forecasting Vision Foundation Model Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11225v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Forecasting from partial observations is central to world modeling. Many recent methods represent the world through images, and reduce forecasting to stochastic video generation. Although such methods excel at realism and visual fidelity, predicting pixels is computationally intensive and not directly useful in many applications, as it requires translating RGB into signals useful for decision making. An alternative approach uses features from vision foundation models (VFMs) as world representations, performing deterministic regression to predict future world states. These features can be directly translated into actionable signals such as semantic segmentation and depth, while remaining computationally efficient. However, deterministic regression averages over multiple plausible futures, undermining forecast accuracy by failing to capture uncertainty. To address this crucial limitation, we introduce a generative forecaster that performs autoregressive flow matching in VFM feature space. Our key insight is that generative modeling in this space requires encoding VFM features into a compact latent space suitable for diffusion. We show that this latent space preserves information more effectively than previously used PCA-based alternatives, both for forecasting and other applications, such as image generation. Our latent predictions can be easily decoded into multiple useful and interpretable output modalities: semantic segmentation, depth, surface normals, and even RGB. With matched architecture and compute, our method produces sharper and more accurate predictions than regression across all modalities. Our results suggest that stochastic conditional generation of VFM features offers a promising and scalable foundation for future world models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditional Text-to-Image Generation with Reference Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16713v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have demonstrated tremendous success in synthesizing visually stunning images given textual instructions. Despite remarkable progress in creating high-fidelity visuals, text-to-image models can still struggle with precisely rendering subjects, such as text spelling. To address this challenge, this paper explores using additional conditions of an image that provides visual guidance of the particular subjects for diffusion models to generate. In addition, this reference condition empowers the model to be conditioned in ways that the vocabularies of the text tokenizer cannot adequately represent, and further extends the model's generalization to novel capabilities such as generating non-English text spellings. We develop several small-scale expert plugins that efficiently endow a Stable Diffusion model with the capability to take different references. Each plugin is trained with auxiliary networks and loss functions customized for applications such as English scene-text generation, multi-lingual scene-text generation, and logo-image generation. Our expert plugins demonstrate superior results than the existing methods on all tasks, each containing only 28.55M trainable parameters.</p></details> | WACV 2026 |
| **[Estimating Object Physical Properties from RGB-D Vision and Depth Robot Sensors Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05029v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inertial mass plays a crucial role in robotic applications such as object grasping, manipulation, and simulation, providing a strong prior for planning and control. Accurately estimating an object's mass before interaction can significantly enhance the performance of various robotic tasks. However, mass estimation using only vision sensors is a relatively underexplored area. This paper proposes a novel approach combining sparse point-cloud data from depth images with RGB images to estimate the mass of objects. We evaluate a range of point-cloud processing architectures, alongside RGB-only methods. To overcome the limited availability of training data, we create a synthetic dataset using ShapeNetSem 3D models, simulating RGBD images via a Kinect camera. This synthetic data is used to train an image generation model for estimating dense depth maps, which we then use to augment an existing dataset of images paired with mass values. Our approach significantly outperforms existing benchmarks across all evaluated metrics. The data generation (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/ShapenetSem-to-RGBD) as well as the training of the depth estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/GLPDepth-Edited) and the mass estimator (https://github.com/RavineWindteer/Depth-mass-estimator) are available online.</p></details> |  |

However, jointly optimizing multiple rewards often incurs an alignment tax, improving one dimension while degrading others. To address this, we introduce two complementary methods: MapReduce LoRA and Reward-aware Token Embedding (RaTE). MapReduce LoRA trains preference-specific LoRA experts in parallel and iteratively merges them to refine a shared base model; RaTE learns reward-specific token embeddings that compose at inference for flexible preference control. Experiments on Text-to-Image generation (Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX.1-dev) show improvements of 36.1%, 4.6%, and 55.7%, and 32.7%, 4.3%, and 67.1% on GenEval, PickScore, and OCR, respectively. On Text-to-Video generation (HunyuanVideo), visual and motion quality improve by 48.1% and 90.0%, respectively. On the language task, Helpful Assistant, with Llama-2 7B, helpful and harmless improve by 43.4% and 136.7%, respectively.

Just as test-time compute and reasoning have helped language models improve their capabilities, similar benefits have also been observed with image generation models. In particular, searching over noise samples for diffusion and flow models has shown to scale well with test-time compute. While recent works have explored allocating non-uniform inference-compute budgets across different denoising steps, they rely on greedy algorithms and allocate the compute budget ineffectively. In this work, we study this problem and propose solutions to fix it. We propose the Verifier-Threshold method which automatically reallocates test-time compute and delivers substantial efficiency improvements. For the same performance on the GenEval benchmark, we achieve a 2-4x reduction in computational time over the state-of-the-art method.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Group Diffusion: Enhancing Image Generation by Unlocking Cross-Sample Collaboration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10954v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore an untapped signal in diffusion model inference. While all previous methods generate images independently at inference, we instead ask if samples can be generated collaboratively. We propose Group Diffusion, unlocking the attention mechanism to be shared across images, rather than limited to just the patches within an image. This enables images to be jointly denoised at inference time, learning both intra and inter-image correspondence. We observe a clear scaling effect - larger group sizes yield stronger cross-sample attention and better generation quality. Furthermore, we introduce a qualitative measure to capture this behavior and show that its strength closely correlates with FID. Built on standard diffusion transformers, our GroupDiff achieves up to 32.2% FID improvement on ImageNet-256x256. Our work reveals cross-sample inference as an effective, previously unexplored mechanism for generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://sichengmo.github.io/GroupDiff/</p></details> |
| **[Are We Ready for RL in Text-to-3D Generation? A Progressive Investigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10949v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), earlier proven to be effective in large language and multi-modal models, has been successfully extended to enhance 2D image generation recently. However, applying RL to 3D generation remains largely unexplored due to the higher spatial complexity of 3D objects, which require globally consistent geometry and fine-grained local textures. This makes 3D generation significantly sensitive to reward designs and RL algorithms. To address these challenges, we conduct the first systematic study of RL for text-to-3D autoregressive generation across several dimensions. (1) Reward designs: We evaluate reward dimensions and model choices, showing that alignment with human preference is crucial, and that general multi-modal models provide robust signal for 3D attributes. (2) RL algorithms: We study GRPO variants, highlighting the effectiveness of token-level optimization, and further investigate the scaling of training data and iterations. (3) Text-to-3D Benchmarks: Since existing benchmarks fail to measure implicit reasoning abilities in 3D generation models, we introduce MME-3DR. (4) Advanced RL paradigms: Motivated by the natural hierarchy of 3D generation, we propose Hi-GRPO, which optimizes the global-to-local hierarchical 3D generation through dedicated reward ensembles. Based on these insights, we develop AR3D-R1, the first RL-enhanced text-to-3D model, expert from coarse shape to texture refinement. We hope this study provides insights into RL-driven reasoning for 3D generation.

However, real-world applications are limited, as current methods achieve high visual fidelity but slow or fast yet temporally unstable. Diffusion methods provide realistic image generation, yet struggle with oneshot settings. Gaussian Splatting approaches are real-time, yet inaccuracies in facial tracking, or inconsistent Gaussian mappings, lead to unstable outputs and video artifacts that are detrimental to realistic use cases. We address this problem by mapping Gaussian Splatting using 3D Morphable Models to generate person-specific avatars. We introduce transformer-based prediction of model parameters, directly from audio, to drive temporal consistency. From monocular video and independent audio speech inputs, our method enables generation of real-time talking head videos where we report competitive quantitative and qualitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE/...</summary><p>IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision 2026</p></details> |

Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making. We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models, variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks, and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models implement it.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear as a book chapter in a Springer book titled "Statistical Foundations and Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Deep Learning" and edited by S.

To that end, we introduce two new computationally inexpensive interpretability and steerability metrics and conduct a systematic analysis on LVLMs. Our analysis uncovers two observations; (i) a majority of SAE neurons exhibit either low interpretability or low steerability or both, rendering them ineffective for downstream use; and (ii) due to the unsupervised nature of SAEs, user-desired concepts are often absent in the learned dictionary, thus limiting their practical utility. To address these limitations, we propose Concept Bottleneck Sparse Autoencoders (CB-SAE) - a novel post-hoc framework that prunes low-utility neurons and augments the latent space with a lightweight concept bottleneck aligned to a user-defined concept set. The resulting CB-SAE improves interpretability by +32.1% and steerability by +14.5% across LVLMs and image generation tasks. We will make our code and model weights available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architecture Decoupling Is Not All You Need For Unified Multimodal Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22663v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models for image generation and understanding represent a significant step toward AGI and have attracted widespread attention from researchers. The main challenge of this task lies in the difficulty in establishing an optimal training paradigm due to inherent conflicting targets in understanding and generation tasks. To alleviate these conflicts and pursue higher performance, many researchers adopt varying degrees of model decoupling (e.g., Double image encoders, MOE/MOT architecture, or frozen MLLM). However, excessive model decoupling can lead to the loss of interleave generation ability, undermining the original intent of unified models. In this work, we aim to explore how to mitigate task conflicts without resorting to model decoupling. Firstly, we analyze why decoupling alleviates conflicts by studying the cross-modal attention behavior of models. We observe that model decoupling essentially drives models toward task-specific multimodal interaction patterns, as seen in Qwen-VL and HunyuanImage, and that the more thorough the decoupling, the more consistent the behavior becomes. Motivated by this observation, we propose Attention Interaction Alignment (AIA) loss, which explicitly learns Task-Specific multimodal interaction patterns during training. To demonstrate the generalizability of our AIA loss, we apply it to Emu3 and Janus-Pro during SFT and post-training stage respectively. Without bells and whistles, AIA not only refines cross-modal attention patterns, but also boosts both generation and understanding performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://zhengdian1.github.io/AIA-project/ Code: https://github.com/zhengdian1/AIA</p></details> |
| **[Glance: Accelerating Diffusion Models with 1 Sample](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02899v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation, yet their deployment remains constrained by the heavy computational cost and the need for numerous inference steps. Previous efforts on fewer-step distillation attempt to skip redundant steps by training compact student models, yet they often suffer from heavy retraining costs and degraded generalization. In this work, we take a different perspective: we accelerate smartly, not evenly, applying smaller speedups to early semantic stages and larger ones to later redundant phases. We instantiate this phase-aware strategy with two experts that specialize in slow and fast denoising phases. Surprisingly, instead of investing massive effort in retraining student models, we find that simply equipping the base model with lightweight LoRA adapters achieves both efficient acceleration and strong generalization. We refer to these two adapters as Slow-LoRA and Fast-LoRA. Through extensive experiments, our method achieves up to 5 acceleration over the base model while maintaining comparable visual quality across diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, the LoRA experts are trained with only 1 samples on a single V100 within one hour, yet the resulting models generalize strongly on unseen prompts.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel control scheme that combines Transformer-driven visual servoing with dualarm impedance control. This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

We present ConsistCompose, a unified multimodal framework that embeds layout coordinates directly into language prompts, enabling layout-controlled multi-instance image generation from Interleaved Image-Text within a single generative interface. We further construct ConsistCompose3M, a 3.4M multi-instance generation dataset with layout and identity annotations (2.6M text-guided and 0.8M image-guided data pairs) that provides large-scale supervision for layout-conditioned generation. Within this framework, LELG is instantiated through instance-coordinate binding prompts and coordinate-aware classifier-free guidance, which translate linguistic layout cues into precise spatial control without task-specific branches. Experiments on COCO-Position and MS-Bench show that ConsistCompose substantially improves spatial accuracy over layout-controlled baselines while preserving identity fidelity and competitive general multimodal understanding, establishing a unified paradigm for layout-controllable multimodal image generation.</p></details> | 22 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Guiding What Not to Generate: Automated Negative Prompting for Text-Image Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07702v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite substantial progress in text-to-image generation, achieving precise text-image alignment remains challenging, particularly for prompts with rich compositional structure or imaginative elements. To address this, we introduce Negative Prompting for Image Correction (NPC), an automated pipeline that improves alignment by identifying and applying negative prompts that suppress unintended content. We begin by analyzing cross-attention patterns to explain why both targeted negatives-those directly tied to the prompt's alignment error-and untargeted negatives-tokens unrelated to the prompt but present in the generated image-can enhance alignment. To discover useful negatives, NPC generates candidate prompts using a verifier-captioner-proposer framework and ranks them with a salient text-space score, enabling effective selection without requiring additional image synthesis. On GenEval++ and Imagine-Bench, NPC outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.571 vs. 0.371 on GenEval++ and the best overall performance on Imagine-Bench. By guiding what not to generate, NPC provides a principled, fully automated route to stronger text-image alignment in diffusion models.

In this paper, we reveal a striking geometric regularity in the deterministic sampling dynamics of diffusion generative models: each simulated sampling trajectory along the gradient field lies within an extremely low-dimensional subspace, and all trajectories exhibit an almost identical boomerang shape, regardless of the model architecture, applied conditions, or generated content. We characterize several intriguing properties of these trajectories, particularly under closed-form solutions based on kernel-estimated data modeling. We also demonstrate a practical application of the discovered trajectory regularity by proposing a dynamic programming-based scheme to better align the sampling time schedule with the underlying trajectory structure. This simple strategy requires minimal modification to existing deterministic numerical solvers, incurs negligible computational overhead, and achieves superior image generation performance, especially in regions with only 5 - 10 function evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages.

In stage 1, an auto-encoder is trained to compress an image into a latent space; in stage 2, a generative model is trained to learn a distribution over that latent space. This reveals a fundamental trade-off, do we compress more aggressively to make the latent distribution easier for the stage 2 model to learn even if it makes reconstruction worse? We study this problem in the context of discrete, auto-regressive image generation. Through the lens of scaling laws, we show that smaller stage 2 models can benefit from more compressed stage 1 latents even if reconstruction performance worsens, demonstrating that generation modeling capacity plays a role in this trade-off. Diving deeper, we rigorously study the connection between compute scaling and the stage 1 rate-distortion trade-off. Next, we introduce Causally Regularized Tokenization (CRT), which uses knowledge of the stage 2 generation modeling procedure to embed useful inductive biases in stage 1 latents. This regularization improves stage 2 generation performance better by making the tokens easier to model without affecting the stage 1 compression rate and marginally affecting distortion: we are able to improve compute efficiency 2-3$\times$ over baseline. Finally, we use CRT with further optimizations to the visual tokenizer setup to result in a generative pipeline that matches LlamaGen-3B generation performance (2.18 FID) with half the tokens per image (256 vs. 576) and a fourth the total model parameters (775M vs. 3.1B) while using the same architecture and inference procedure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Nevertheless, these models still encounter difficulties in achieving human-like compositional generalization. In this study, we propose a new method called Independent Density Estimation (IDE) to tackle this challenge. IDE aims to learn the connection between individual words in a sentence and the corresponding features in an image, enabling compositional generalization. We build two models based on the philosophy of IDE. The first one utilizes fully disentangled visual representations as input, and the second leverages a Variational Auto-Encoder to obtain partially disentangled features from raw images. Additionally, we propose an entropy-based compositional inference method to combine predictions of each word in the sentence. Our models exhibit superior generalization to unseen compositions compared to current models when evaluated on various datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 table, 4 figures</p></details> |

OneFlow enables concurrent text-image synthesis with hierarchical sampling that prioritizes content over grammar. Through controlled experiments across model sizes from 1B to 8B, we demonstrate that OneFlow outperforms autoregressive baselines on both generation and understanding tasks while using up to 50% fewer training FLOPs. OneFlow surpasses both autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches while unlocking new capabilities for concurrent generation, iterative refinement, and natural reasoning-like generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://oneflow.framer.ai</p></details> |

We develop a highly efficient diffusion transformer with a powerful VAE which also can reduce the number of image tokens considerably. This allows for efficient training of our model, and enables it to fast generate native high-resolution images (e.g., 1K-4K). Seedream 4.0 is pretrained on billions of text-image pairs spanning diverse taxonomies and knowledge-centric concepts. Comprehensive data collection across hundreds of vertical scenarios, coupled with optimized strategies, ensures stable and large-scale training, with strong generalization. By incorporating a carefully fine-tuned VLM model, we perform multi-modal post-training for training both T2I and image editing tasks jointly. For inference acceleration, we integrate adversarial distillation, distribution matching, and quantization, as well as speculative decoding. It achieves an inference time of up to 1.8 seconds for generating a 2K image (without a LLM/VLM as PE model). Comprehensive evaluations reveal that Seedream 4.0 can achieve state-of-the-art results on both T2I and multimodal image editing. In particular, it demonstrates exceptional multimodal capabilities in complex tasks, including precise image editing and in-context reasoning, and also allows for multi-image reference, and can generate multiple output images. This extends traditional T2I systems into an more interactive and multidimensional creative tool, pushing the boundary of generative AI for both creativity and professional applications. We further scale our model and data as Seedream 4.5.

A prominent interest pertains to the integration of an image prompt adapter to facilitate zero-shot PT2I without test-time fine-tuning. However, current methods grapple with three fundamental challenges: 1. the elusive equilibrium between Concept Preservation (CP) and Prompt Following (PF), 2. the difficulty in retaining fine-grained concept details in reference images, and 3. the restricted scalability to extend to multi-subject personalization. To tackle these challenges, we present Dynamic Image Prompt Adapter (DynaIP), a cutting-edge plugin to enhance the fine-grained concept fidelity, CP-PF balance, and subject scalability of SOTA T2I multimodal diffusion transformers (MM-DiT) for PT2I generation. Our key finding is that MM-DiT inherently exhibit decoupling learning behavior when injecting reference image features into its dual branches via cross attentions. Based on this, we design an innovative Dynamic Decoupling Strategy that removes the interference of concept-agnostic information during inference, significantly enhancing the CP-PF balance and further bolstering the scalability of multi-subject compositions. Moreover, we identify the visual encoder as a key factor affecting fine-grained CP and reveal that the hierarchical features of commonly used CLIP can capture visual information at diverse granularity levels. Therefore, we introduce a novel Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts Feature Fusion Module to fully leverage the hierarchical features of CLIP, remarkably elevating the fine-grained concept fidelity while also providing flexible control of visual granularity. Extensive experiments across single- and multi-subject PT2I tasks verify that our DynaIP outperforms existing approaches, marking a notable advancement in the field of PT2l generation.</p></details> |  |

However, previous works only focus on single-source audio inputs for image generation, ignoring the multi-source characteristic in natural auditory scenes, thus limiting the performance in generating comprehensive visual content. To bridge this gap, we propose a method called MACS to conduct multi-source audio-to-image generation. To our best knowledge, this is the first work that explicitly separates multi-source audio to capture the rich audio components before image generation. MACS is a two-stage method. In the first stage, multi-source audio inputs are separated by a weakly supervised method, where the audio and text labels are semantically aligned by casting into a common space using the large pre-trained CLAP model. We introduce a ranking loss to consider the contextual significance of the separated audio signals. In the second stage, effective image generation is achieved by mapping the separated audio signals to the generation condition using only a trainable adapter and a MLP layer. We preprocess the LLP dataset as the first full multi-source audio-to-image generation benchmark. The experiments are conducted on multi-source, mixed-source, and single-source audio-to-image generation tasks. The proposed MACS outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods in 17 out of the 21 evaluation indexes on all tasks and delivers superior visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026.
