A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, v0.8</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-GS: Unifying Vision-Language Representation with 3D Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19142v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works in 3D multimodal learning have made remarkable progress. However, typically 3D multimodal models are only capable of handling point clouds. Compared to the emerging 3D representation technique, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), the spatially sparse point cloud cannot depict the texture information of 3D objects, resulting in inferior reconstruction capabilities. This limitation constrains the potential of point cloud-based 3D multimodal representation learning. In this paper, we present CLIP-GS, a novel multimodal representation learning framework grounded in 3DGS. We introduce the GS Tokenizer to generate serialized gaussian tokens, which are then processed through transformer layers pre-initialized with weights from point cloud models, resulting in the 3DGS embeddings. CLIP-GS leverages contrastive loss between 3DGS and the visual-text embeddings of CLIP, and we introduce an image voting loss to guide the directionality and convergence of gradient optimization. Furthermore, we develop an efficient way to generate triplets of 3DGS, images, and text, facilitating CLIP-GS in learning unified multimodal representations. Leveraging the well-aligned multimodal representations, CLIP-GS demonstrates versatility and outperforms point cloud-based models on various 3D tasks, including multimodal retrieval, zero-shot, and few-shot classification.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAPL: Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning in CLIP for Weakly Supervised Image Manipulation Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06222v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious image manipulation threatens public safety and requires efficient localization methods. Existing approaches depend on costly pixel-level annotations which make training expensive. Existing weakly supervised methods rely only on image-level binary labels and focus on global classification, often overlooking local edge cues that are critical for precise localization. We observe that feature variations at manipulated boundaries are substantially larger than in interior regions. To address this gap, we propose Semantic-Agnostic Prompt Learning (SAPL) in CLIP, which learns text prompts that intentionally encode non-semantic, boundary-centric cues so that CLIPs multimodal similarity highlights manipulation edges rather than high-level object semantics. SAPL combines two complementary modules Edge-aware Contextual Prompt Learning (ECPL) and Hierarchical Edge Contrastive Learning (HECL) to exploit edge information in both textual and visual spaces. The proposed ECPL leverages edge-enhanced image features to generate learnable textual prompts via an attention mechanism, embedding semantic-irrelevant information into text features, to guide CLIP focusing on manipulation edges. The proposed HECL extract genuine and manipulated edge patches, and utilize contrastive learning to boost the discrimination between genuine edge patches and manipulated edge patches. Finally, we predict the manipulated regions from the similarity map after processing. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks demonstrate that SAPL significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving state-of-the-art localization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Understanding to Engagement: Personalized pharmacy Video Clips via Vision Language Models (VLMs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05059v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision Language Models (VLMs) are poised to revolutionize the digital transformation of pharmacyceutical industry by enabling intelligent, scalable, and automated multi-modality content processing. Traditional manual annotation of heterogeneous data modalities (text, images, video, audio, and web links), is prone to inconsistencies, quality degradation, and inefficiencies in content utilization. The sheer volume of long video and audio data further exacerbates these challenges, (e.g. long clinical trial interviews and educational seminars). Here, we introduce a domain adapted Video to Video Clip Generation framework that integrates Audio Language Models (ALMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) to produce highlight clips. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a reproducible Cut & Merge algorithm with fade in/out and timestamp normalization, ensuring smooth transitions and audio/visual alignment; (ii) a personalization mechanism based on role definition and prompt injection for tailored outputs (marketing, training, regulatory); (iii) a cost efficient e2e pipeline strategy balancing ALM/VLM enhanced processing. Evaluations on Video MME benchmark (900) and our proprietary dataset of 16,159 pharmacy videos across 14 disease areas demonstrate 3 to 4 times speedup, 4 times cost reduction, and competitive clip quality. Beyond efficiency gains, we also report our methods improved clip coherence scores (0.348) and informativeness scores (0.721) over state of the art VLM baselines (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Pro), highlighting the potential of transparent, custom extractive, and compliance supporting video summarization for life sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Contr...</summary><p>Contributed original research to top tier conference in VLM; currently undergoing peer review</p></details> |
| **[Minimal Clips, Maximum Salience: Long Video Summarization via Key Moment Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11399v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are able to process increasingly longer videos. Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO: Ensuring Bounded Ratios for Stable and Generalizable Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03895v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07629v3)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARM: A Learnable, Plug-and-Play Module for CLIP-based Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24224v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Clipped Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: A Refined Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23178v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\frak p}$-th moment where ${\frak p}\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\frak l}^{\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\frak l}\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\in\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}d_{\rm eff}^{-1/2{\frak p}}\ln^{1-1/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ and ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2d_{\rm eff}^{-1/{\frak p}}\ln^{2-2/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\rm eff}\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part of this work is in submission</p></details> |

We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[CLIP Based Region-Aware Feature Fusion for Automated BBPS Scoring in Colonoscopy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20374v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually. In this paper, to support robust training and evaluation, we construct a high-quality colonoscopy dataset comprising 2,240 images from 517 subjects, annotated with expert-agreed BBPS scores. We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, BMVC 2025 submission</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Cosine Similarity Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPECIAL: Zero-shot Hyperspectral Image Classification With CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16222v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to categorize each pixel in an HSI into a specific land cover class, which is crucial for applications such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and agriculture. Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations. The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning. In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands. These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores. To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales. In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/LiPang/SPECIAL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond CLIP: Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Transformers for Cross-Modal Alignment in Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19663v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Exploration vs Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16912v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</p></details> | 35 pages |

This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[On the dynamic evolution of CLIP texture-shape bias and its relationship to human alignment and model robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09814v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language-image models such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities. However, how their internal visual representations evolve during training and how this evolution relates to human perception remains poorly understood. Most existing analysis characterize fully trained models, leaving the dynamics of representational biases and perceptual alignment largely unexplored. In this work, we present an epoch-by-epoch analysis of CLIP models throughout training, focusing on the evolution of texture-shape bias, alignment with human perceptual judgements, and sensitivity to image noise. Using multiple perceptual benchmarks spanning low-level image quality assessment, mid-level perceptual similarity, saliency correspondence, and noisy robustness, we identify a consistent, training-stage-dependent representational transition. Early training stages exhibit strong texture bias, elevated alignment with low-level human perceptual measures, and increased sensitivity to Gaussian noise perturbations. As training progresses, this texture bias gradually diminishes in favor of more shape-based representations, coinciding with improved robustness to noise and a decline in low-level perceptual alignment. Importantly, these dynamics are consistently observed across multiple CLIP model scales, indicating that the phenomenon is not specific to a particular architecture size. Our findings provide an empirical characterization of how perceptual alignment, feature bias, and robustness co-evolve during multimodal model training. This work reveals a systematic trade-off between early low-level perceptual alignment and later robustness, offering new insights into the representational dynamics of vision-language models and their relationship to human visual processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABE-CLIP: Training-Free Attribute Binding Enhancement for Compositional Image-Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17178v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |

The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR.

| **[The Effect of Negation on CLIP in Medical Imaging: Limitations of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17121v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models like CLIP are increasingly used in medical imaging tasks due to their ability to align images and text without the need for extensive labeled data. This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to WACV Pixels to Patients Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Non-Asymptotic Global Convergence of PPO-Clip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16565v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Frames to Clips: Training-free Adaptive Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on various vision-language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames, which quickly exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics in long-form videos, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work, we systematically examine the role of temporal information and show that extending selection from isolated key frames to temporally coherent key clips improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we introduce frame resolution as a controllable factor in frame selection, enabling a trade-off between spatial resolution and clip length. Building on this idea, we propose an adaptive clip length module that dynamically balances these factors to ensure a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling by up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling VLMs to real-world video understanding applications.

The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ostadabbas/AdSum204.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 32nd International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling</p></details> |

Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Bias-Variance Trade-off for Clipped Stochastic First-Order Methods: From Bounded Variance to Infinite Mean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14686v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic optimization is fundamental to modern machine learning. Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $α$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $α\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $α$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $α\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $α\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |

However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025. Code: https://github.com/hustvl/SuperCLIP</p></details> |

Our method leverages nullspace projection to erase the target class information embedded in the final projection layer, without requiring any retraining or the use of images from the forget set. By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective, Controlled and Domain-Agnostic Unlearning in Pretrained CLIP: A Training- and Data-Free Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14113v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or "unlearning") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Uncertainty for Zero-Shot Adversarial CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12997v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP delivers strong zero-shot classification but remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Their impressive capabilities address many of the long-standing challenges faced by physics-based simulators, driving broad adoption in many problem domains, e.g., robotics. For example, video models enable photorealistic, physically consistent deformable-body simulation without making prohibitive simplifying assumptions, which is a major bottleneck in physics-based simulation. Moreover, video models can serve as foundation world models that capture the dynamics of the world in a fine-grained and expressive way. They thus overcome the limited expressiveness of language-only abstractions in describing intricate physical interactions. In this survey, we provide a review of video models and their applications as embodied world models in robotics, encompassing cost-effective data generation and action prediction in imitation learning, dynamics and rewards modeling in reinforcement learning, visual planning, and policy evaluation. Further, we highlight important challenges hindering the trustworthy integration of video models in robotics, which include poor instruction following, hallucinations such as violations of physics, and unsafe content generation, in addition to fundamental limitations such as significant data curation, training, and inference costs. We present potential future directions to address these open research challenges to motivate research and ultimately facilitate broader applications, especially in safety-critical settings.</p></details> |  |

However, Intervention-requiring Failures (IR Failures) (e.g., a robot spilling water or breaking fragile glass) during real-world exploration happen inevitably, hindering the practical deployment of such a paradigm. To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training.

The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.

These failures primarily stem from the disconnect between abstract user goals and technical documentation, and the limited capacity of fixed-size embeddings to model combinatorial tool compositions. To address these challenges, we propose TOOLQP, a lightweight framework that models retrieval as iterative query planning. Instead of single-shot matching, TOOLQP decomposes instructions into sub-tasks and dynamically generates queries to interact with the retriever, effectively bridging the semantic gap by targeting the specific sub-tasks required for composition. We train TOOLQP using synthetic query trajectories followed by optimization via Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Experiments demonstrate that TOOLQP achieves state-of-the-art performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot generalization, robustness across diverse retrievers, and significant improvements in downstream agentic execution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Evidence to Reasoning Efficient Video Understanding via Explicit Evidence Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07761v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) face a fundamental dilemma in video reasoning: they are caught between the prohibitive computational costs of verbose reasoning and the hallucination risks of efficient, ungrounded approaches. To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art. They significantly outperform existing methods in accuracy, proving CoE to be a powerful and practical paradigm for reliable video understanding.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[MiST: Understanding the Role of Mid-Stage Scientific Training in Developing Chemical Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21231v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models can develop reasoning capabilities through online fine-tuning with rule-based rewards. However, recent studies reveal a critical constraint: reinforcement learning succeeds only when the base model already assigns non-negligible probability to correct answers -- a property we term 'latent solvability'. This work investigates the emergence of chemical reasoning capabilities and what these prerequisites mean for chemistry. We identify two necessary conditions for RL-based chemical reasoning: 1) Symbolic competence, and 2) Latent chemical knowledge. We propose mid-stage scientific training (MiST): a set of mid-stage training techniques to satisfy these, including data-mixing with SMILES/CIF-aware pre-processing, continued pre-training on 2.9B tokens, and supervised fine-tuning on 1B tokens. These steps raise the latent-solvability score on 3B and 7B models by up to 1.8x, and enable RL to lift top-1 accuracy from 10.9 to 63.9% on organic reaction naming, and from 40.6 to 67.4% on inorganic material generation. Similar results are observed for other challenging chemical tasks, while producing interpretable reasoning traces. Our results define clear prerequisites for chemical reasoning training and highlight the broader role of mid-stage training in unlocking reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, integrating exteroception remains a significant challenge: mapping-based methods suffer from state estimation drift; for instance, LiDAR-based methods do not handle torso jitter well. Existing end-to-end approaches often struggle with scalability and training complexity; specifically, some previous works using virtual obstacles are implemented case-by-case. In this work, we present \textit{Hiking in the Wild}, a scalable, end-to-end parkour perceptive framework designed for robust humanoid hiking. To ensure safety and training stability, we introduce two key mechanisms: a foothold safety mechanism combining scalable \textit{Terrain Edge Detection} with \textit{Foot Volume Points} to prevent catastrophic slippage on edges, and a \textit{Flat Patch Sampling} strategy that mitigates reward hacking by generating feasible navigation targets. Our approach utilizes a single-stage reinforcement learning scheme, mapping raw depth inputs and proprioception directly to joint actions, without relying on external state estimation. Extensive field experiments on a full-size humanoid demonstrate that our policy enables robust traversal of complex terrains at speeds up to 2.5 m/s. The training and deployment code is open-sourced to facilitate reproducible research and deployment on real robots with minimal hardware modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://project-instinct.github.io/hiking-in-the-wild</p></details> |

Traditional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches, primarily based on relative ranking, often suffer from severe reward sparsity and gradient instability, failing to effectively exploit the verifiable signals provided by 3D physical constraints. Notably, in standard GRPO frameworks, relative normalization causes "near-miss" samples (characterized by small but non-zero errors) to suffer from advantage collapse. This leads to a severe data utilization bottleneck where valuable boundary samples are discarded during optimization. To address this, we introduce the Smooth Numerical Reward Activation (SNRA) operator and the Absolute-Preserving GRPO (AP-GRPO) framework. SNRA employs a dynamically parameterized Sigmoid function to transform raw feedback into a dense, continuous reward continuum. Concurrently, AP-GRPO integrates absolute scalar gradients to mitigate the numerical information loss inherent in conventional relative-ranking mechanisms. By leveraging this approach, we constructed Numerical3D-50k, a dataset comprising 50,000 verifiable 3D subtasks. Empirical results indicate that AP-GRPO achieves performance parity with large-scale supervised methods while maintaining higher data efficiency, effectively activating latent 3D reasoning in VLMs without requiring architectural modifications.</p></details> |  |

This challenge motivates renewed interest in neuromorphic computing principles, which promise brain-like efficiency through discrete and sparse activations, recurrent dynamics, and non-linear feedback. In fact, modern AI architectures increasingly embody neuromorphic principles through heavily quantized activations, state-space dynamics, and sparse attention mechanisms. This paper elaborates on the connections between neuromorphic models, state-space models, and transformer architectures through the lens of the distinction between intra-token processing and inter-token processing. Most early work on neuromorphic AI was based on spiking neural networks (SNNs) for intra-token processing, i.e., for transformations involving multiple channels, or features, of the same vector input, such as the pixels of an image. In contrast, more recent research has explored how neuromorphic principles can be leveraged to design efficient inter-token processing methods, which selectively combine different information elements depending on their contextual relevance. Implementing associative memorization mechanisms, these approaches leverage state-space dynamics or sparse self-attention. Along with a systematic presentation of modern neuromorphic AI models through the lens of intra-token and inter-token processing, training methodologies for neuromorphic AI models are also reviewed. These range from surrogate gradients leveraging parallel convolutional processing to local learning rules based on reinforcement learning mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

We formulate individual claims reserving as a claim-level Markov decision process in which an agent sequentially updates outstanding claim liability (OCL) estimates over development, using continuous actions and a reward design that balances accuracy with stable reserve revisions. A key advantage of this reinforcement learning (RL) approach is that it can learn from all observed claim trajectories, including claims that remain open at valuation, thereby avoiding the reduced sample size and selection effects inherent in supervised methods trained on ultimate outcomes only. We also introduce practical components needed for actuarial use -- initialisation of new claims, temporally consistent tuning via a rolling-settlement scheme, and an importance-weighting mechanism to mitigate portfolio-level underestimation driven by the rarity of large claims. On CAS and SPLICE synthetic general insurance datasets, the proposed Soft Actor-Critic implementation delivers competitive claim-level accuracy and strong aggregate OCL performance, particularly for the immature claim segments that drive most of the liability.</p></details> |  |

To address the instability commonly observed in MoE training, we propose a novel router-aware approach to optimize importance sampling (IS) weights in off-policy RL. Specifically, we design a rescaling strategy guided by router logits, which effectively reduces gradient variance and mitigates training divergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the convergence stability and the final performance of MoE models, highlighting the potential of RL algorithmic innovations tailored to MoE architectures and providing a promising direction for efficient training of large-scale expert models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added additional experiments, improved analysis, and fixed minor issues</p></details> |

A linear-policy-based approximation is derived for the relative-value function in the Bellman equation of the power control problem. This approximation leads to two fundamental power control policies: optimistic and robust clipped affine policies, both taking the form of a clipped affine function of the battery level and the reciprocal of channel signal-to-noise ratio coefficient. They are essentially battery-limited weighted directional waterfilling policies operating between adjacent time slots. By leveraging the relative-value approximation and derived policies, a domain-knowledge-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm is proposed for online power control. The proposed approach is further extended to scenarios with energy and/or channel lookahead. Comprehensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve a good balance between computational complexity and optimality. In particular, the robust clipped affine policy (combined with RL, using at most five parameters) outperforms all existing approaches across various scenarios, with less than 2\% performance loss relative to the optimal policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, v0.8</p></details> |

Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation. Based on this, we also propose an RL training framework that contains a novel reward design and an adaptive rollout generation approach by leveraging "translation difficulty" to further improve the translation quality of translation agents using our search tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed typos in Table 1, Figure 7 and Section 4.2: regex -> exact.

While large language models (LLMs) show promise for RTL code generation, their ability to reason about hardware specifications and generate targeted test plans remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic study of LLM reasoning capabilities for RTL verification stimuli generation, establishing a two-stage framework that decomposes test plan generation from testbench execution. Our benchmark reveals that state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1 and Claude-4.0-Sonnet, achieve only 15.7-21.7% success rates on generating stimuli that pass golden RTL designs. To improve LLM generated stimuli, we develop a comprehensive training methodology combining supervised fine-tuning with a novel reinforcement learning approach, GRPO with State Mutation (GRPO-SMu), which enhances exploration by varying input mutations. Our approach leverages a tree-based branching mutation strategy to construct training data comprising equivalent and mutated trees, moving beyond linear mutation approaches to provide rich learning signals. Training on this curated dataset, our 7B parameter model achieves a 33.3% golden test pass rate and a 13.9% mutation detection rate, representing a 17.6% absolute improvement over baseline and outperforming much larger general-purpose models. These results demonstrate that specialized training methodologies can significantly enhance LLM reasoning capabilities for hardware verification tasks, establishing a foundation for automated sub-unit testing in semiconductor design workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Physics Instrument Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07580v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the use of large language models (LLMs) for physics instrument design and compare their performance to reinforcement learning (RL). Using only prompting, LLMs are given task constraints and summaries of prior high-scoring designs and propose complete detector configurations, which we evaluate with the same simulators and reward functions used in RL-based optimization. Although RL yields stronger final designs, we find that modern LLMs consistently generate valid, resource-aware, and physically meaningful configurations that draw on broad pretrained knowledge of detector design principles and particle--matter interactions, despite having no task-specific training. Based on this result, as a first step toward hybrid design workflows, we explore pairing the LLMs with a dedicated trust region optimizer, serving as a precursor to future pipelines in which LLMs propose and structure design hypotheses while RL performs reward-driven optimization. Based on these experiments, we argue that LLMs are well suited as meta-planners: they can design and orchestrate RL-based optimization studies, define search strategies, and coordinate multiple interacting components within a unified workflow. In doing so, they point toward automated, closed-loop instrument design in which much of the human effort required to structure and supervise optimization can be reduced.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Reasoning Help Large Language Models Capture Human Annotator Disagreement?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19467v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Variation in human annotation (i.e., disagreements) is common in NLP, often reflecting important information like task subjectivity and sample ambiguity. Modeling this variation is important for applications that are sensitive to such information. Although RLVR-style reasoning (Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards) has improved Large Language Model (LLM) performance on many tasks, it remains unclear whether such reasoning enables LLMs to capture informative variation in human annotation. In this work, we evaluate the influence of different reasoning settings on LLM disagreement modeling. We systematically evaluate each reasoning setting across model sizes, distribution expression methods, and steering methods, resulting in 60 experimental setups across 3 tasks. Surprisingly, our results show that RLVR-style reasoning degrades performance in disagreement modeling, while naive Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves the performance of RLHF LLMs (RL from human feedback). These findings underscore the potential risk of replacing human annotators with reasoning LLMs, especially when disagreements are important.</p></details> | EACL 2026 Main |
| **[Stagewise Reinforcement Learning and the Geometry of the Regret Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07524v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Singular learning theory characterizes Bayesian learning as an evolving tradeoff between accuracy and complexity, with transitions between qualitatively different solutions as sample size increases. We extend this theory to deep reinforcement learning, proving that the concentration of the generalized posterior over policies is governed by the local learning coefficient (LLC), an invariant of the geometry of the regret function. This theory predicts that Bayesian phase transitions in reinforcement learning should proceed from simple policies with high regret to complex policies with low regret. We verify this prediction empirically in a gridworld environment exhibiting stagewise policy development: phase transitions over SGD training manifest as "opposing staircases" where regret decreases sharply while the LLC increases. Notably, the LLC detects phase transitions even when estimated on a subset of states where the policies appear identical in terms of regret, suggesting it captures changes in the underlying algorithm rather than just performance.</p></details> | 50 pages, 14 figures |

Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains difficult. We propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground the image segmentation process via text inputs. It includes a novel transformer-based architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all evaluated tasks.

| **[Controlling Multimodal Conversational Agents with Coverage-Enhanced Latent Actions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07516v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models are increasingly employed as multimodal conversational agents (MCAs) for diverse conversational tasks. Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored for adapting MCAs to various human-AI interaction scenarios. Despite showing great enhancement in generalization performance, fine-tuning MCAs via RL still faces challenges in handling the extremely large text token space. To address this, we learn a compact latent action space for RL fine-tuning instead. Specifically, we adopt the learning from observation mechanism to construct the codebook for the latent action space, where future observations are leveraged to estimate current latent actions that could further be used to reconstruct future observations. However, the scarcity of paired image-text data hinders learning a codebook with sufficient coverage. Thus, we leverage both paired image-text data and text-only data to construct the latent action space, using a cross-modal projector for transforming text embeddings into image-text embeddings. We initialize the cross-modal projector on paired image-text data, and further train it on massive text-only data with a novel cycle consistency loss to enhance its robustness. We show that our latent action based method outperforms competitive baselines on two conversation tasks across various RL algorithms.</p></details> |  |

| **[Online Markov Decision Processes with Terminal Law Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07492v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional reinforcement learning usually assumes either episodic interactions with resets or continuous operation to minimize average or cumulative loss. While episodic settings have many theoretical results, resets are often unrealistic in practice. The infinite-horizon setting avoids this issue but lacks non-asymptotic guarantees in online scenarios with unknown dynamics. In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes. To evaluate algorithms in this framework, we introduce the periodic regret, a measure that balances cumulative loss with the terminal law constraint. We then propose the first algorithms for computing periodic policies in two multi-agent settings and show they achieve sublinear periodic regret of order $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. This provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees for reset-free learning in the setting of $M$ homogeneous agents, for $M > 1$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging the Linguistic Divide: A Survey on Leveraging Large Language Models for Machine Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01919v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly reshaping machine translation (MT), particularly by introducing instruction-following, in-context learning, and preference-based alignment into what has traditionally been a supervised encoder-decoder paradigm. This survey provides a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of how LLMs are being leveraged for MT across data regimes, languages, and application settings. We systematically analyze prompting-based methods, parameter-efficient and full fine-tuning strategies, synthetic data generation, preference-based optimization, and reinforcement learning with human and weakly supervised feedback. Special attention is given to low-resource translation, where we examine the roles of synthetic data quality, diversity, and preference signals, as well as the limitations of current RLHF pipelines. We further review recent advances in Mixture-of-Experts models, MT-focused LLMs, and multilingual alignment, highlighting trade-offs between scalability, specialization, and accessibility. Beyond sentence-level translation, we survey emerging document-level and discourse-aware MT methods with LLMs, showing that most approaches extend sentence-level pipelines through structured context selection, post-editing, or reranking rather than requiring fundamentally new data regimes or architectures. Finally, we discuss LLM-based evaluation, its strengths and biases, and its role alongside learned metrics. Overall, this survey positions LLM-based MT as an evolution of traditional MT systems, where gains increasingly depend on data quality, preference alignment, and context utilization rather than scale alone, and outlines open challenges for building robust, inclusive, and controllable translation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puzzle it Out: Local-to-Global World Model for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07463v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) aims to solve cooperative decision-making problems in multi-agent systems using pre-collected datasets. Existing offline MARL methods primarily constrain training within the dataset distribution, resulting in overly conservative policies that struggle to generalize beyond the support of the data. While model-based approaches offer a promising solution by expanding the original dataset with synthetic data generated from a learned world model, the high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and complexity of multi-agent systems make it challenging to accurately estimate the transitions and reward functions in offline MARL. Given the difficulty of directly modeling joint dynamics, we propose a local-to-global (LOGO) world model, a novel framework that leverages local predictions-which are easier to estimate-to infer global state dynamics, thus improving prediction accuracy while implicitly capturing agent-wise dependencies. Using the trained world model, we generate synthetic data to augment the original dataset, expanding the effective state-action space. To ensure reliable policy learning, we further introduce an uncertainty-aware sampling mechanism that adaptively weights synthetic data by prediction uncertainty, reducing approximation error propagation to policies. In contrast to conventional ensemble-based methods, our approach requires only an additional encoder for uncertainty estimation, significantly reducing computational overhead while maintaining accuracy. Extensive experiments across 8 scenarios against 8 baselines demonstrate that our method surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on standard offline MARL benchmarks, establishing a new model-based baseline for generalizable offline multi-agent learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPEC-RL: Accelerating On-Policy Reinforcement Learning with Speculative Rollouts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23232v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly rely on reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) to elicit reliable chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including AIME24, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models.

| **[BiTrajDiff: Bidirectional Trajectory Generation with Diffusion Models for Offline Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05762v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) have proven that effective policy learning can benefit from imposing conservative constraints on pre-collected datasets. However, such static datasets often exhibit distribution bias, resulting in limited generalizability. To address this limitation, a straightforward solution is data augmentation (DA), which leverages generative models to enrich data distribution. Despite the promising results, current DA techniques focus solely on reconstructing future trajectories from given states, while ignoring the exploration of history transitions that reach them. This single-direction paradigm inevitably hinders the discovery of diverse behavior patterns, especially those leading to critical states that may have yielded high-reward outcomes. In this work, we introduce Bidirectional Trajectory Diffusion (BiTrajDiff), a novel DA framework for offline RL that models both future and history trajectories from any intermediate states. Specifically, we decompose the trajectory generation task into two independent yet complementary diffusion processes: one generating forward trajectories to predict future dynamics, and the other generating backward trajectories to trace essential history transitions.BiTrajDiff can efficiently leverage critical states as anchors to expand into potentially valuable yet underexplored regions of the state space, thereby facilitating dataset diversity. Extensive experiments on the D4RL benchmark suite demonstrate that BiTrajDiff achieves superior performance compared to other advanced DA methods across various offline RL backbones.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outcome-Grounded Advantage Reshaping for Fine-Grained Credit Assignment in Mathematical Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07408v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a promising critic-free reinforcement learning paradigm for reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO employs a coarse-grained credit assignment mechanism that propagates group-level rewards uniformly to to every token in a sequence, neglecting the varying contribution of individual reasoning steps. We address this limitation by introducing Outcome-grounded Advantage Reshaping (OAR), a fine-grained credit assignment mechanism that redistributes advantages based on how much each token influences the model's final answer. We instantiate OAR via two complementary strategies: (1) OAR-P, which estimates outcome sensitivity through counterfactual token perturbations, serving as a high-fidelity attribution signal; (2) OAR-G, which uses an input-gradient sensitivity proxy to approximate the influence signal with a single backward pass. These importance signals are integrated with a conservative Bi-Level advantage reshaping scheme that suppresses low-impact tokens and boosts pivotal ones while preserving the overall advantage mass. Empirical results on extensive mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that while OAR-P sets the performance upper bound, OAR-G achieves comparable gains with negligible computational overhead, both significantly outperforming a strong GRPO baseline, pushing the boundaries of critic-free LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Non-decoupling of Supervised Fine-tuning and Reinforcement Learning in Post-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07389v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training of large language models routinely interleaves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL). These two methods have different objectives: SFT minimizes the cross-entropy loss between model outputs and expert responses, while RL maximizes reward signals derived from human preferences or rule-based verifiers. Modern reasoning models have widely adopted the practice of alternating SFT and RL training. However, there is no theoretical account of whether they can be decoupled. We prove that decoupling is impossible in either order: (1) SFT-then-RL coupling: RL increases SFT loss under SFT optimality and (2) RL-then-SFT coupling: SFT lowers the reward achieved by RL. Experiments on Qwen3-0.6B confirm the predicted degradation, verifying that SFT and RL cannot be separated without loss of prior performance in the post-training</p></details> |  |

Rather than relying on monolithic, end-to-end RL pipelines, OpenTinker decomposes agentic learning systems into lightweight, composable components with clearly defined abstraction boundaries. Users specify agents, environments, and interaction protocols, while inference and training are delegated to a managed execution runtime. OpenTinker introduces a centralized scheduler for managing training and inference workloads, including LoRA-based and full-parameter RL, supervised fine-tuning, and inference, over shared resources. We further discuss design principles for extending OpenTinker to multi-agent training. Finally, we present a set of RL use cases that demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework in practical agentic learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Modeling from Natural Language Human Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07349v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable reward (RLVR) on preference data has become the mainstream approach for training Generative Reward Models (GRMs). Typically in pairwise rewarding tasks, GRMs generate reasoning chains ending with critiques and preference labels, and RLVR then relies on the correctness of the preference labels as the training reward. However, in this paper, we demonstrate that such binary classification tasks make GRMs susceptible to guessing correct outcomes without sound critiques. Consequently, these spurious successes introduce substantial noise into the reward signal, thereby impairing the effectiveness of reinforcement learning. To address this issue, we propose Reward Modeling from Natural Language Human Feedback (RM-NLHF), which leverages natural language feedback to obtain process reward signals, thereby mitigating the problem of limited solution space inherent in binary tasks. Specifically, we compute the similarity between GRM-generated and human critiques as the training reward, which provides more accurate reward signals than outcome-only supervision. Additionally, considering that human critiques are difficult to scale up, we introduce Meta Reward Model (MetaRM) which learns to predict process reward from datasets with human critiques and then generalizes to data without human critiques. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GRMs trained with outcome-only reward, confirming the superiority of integrating natural language over binary human feedback as supervision.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods suffer from limited multi-view data and poor generalization to new viewpoints. We introduce BenchSeg, a novel multi-view food video segmentation dataset and benchmark. BenchSeg aggregates 55 dish scenes (from Nutrition5k, Vegetables & Fruits, MetaFood3D, and FoodKit) with 25,284 meticulously annotated frames, capturing each dish under free 360° camera motion. We evaluate a diverse set of 20 state-of-the-art segmentation models (e.g., SAM-based, transformer, CNN, and large multimodal) on the existing FoodSeg103 dataset and evaluate them (alone and combined with video-memory modules) on BenchSeg. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that while standard image segmenters degrade sharply under novel viewpoints, memory-augmented methods maintain temporal consistency across frames. Our best model based on a combination of SeTR-MLA+XMem2 outperforms prior work (e.g., improving over FoodMem by ~2.63% mAP), offering new insights into food segmentation and tracking for dietary analysis. We release BenchSeg to foster future research.

To address these limitations, we introduce KG-SAM, a knowledge-guided framework that synergistically integrates anatomical priors with boundary refinement and uncertainty estimation. Specifically, KG-SAM incorporates (i) a medical knowledge graph to encode fine-grained anatomical relationships, (ii) an energy-based Conditional Random Field (CRF) to enforce anatomically consistent predictions, and (iii) an uncertainty-aware fusion module to enhance reliability in high-stakes clinical scenarios. Extensive experiments across multi-center medical datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: KG-SAM achieves an average Dice score of 82.69% on prostate segmentation and delivers substantial gains in abdominal segmentation, reaching 78.05% on MRI and 79.68% on CT. These results establish KG-SAM as a robust and generalizable framework for advancing medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods mainly rely on frameworks such as mean teacher and dual-stream consistency learning. These approaches often face issues like error accumulation and model structural complexity, while also neglecting the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data streams. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Bidirectional Channel-selective Semantic Interaction~(BCSI) framework for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. First, we propose a Semantic-Spatial Perturbation~(SSP) mechanism, which disturbs the data using two strong augmentation operations and leverages unsupervised learning with pseudo-labels from weak augmentations. Additionally, we employ consistency on the predictions from the two strong augmentations to further improve model stability and robustness. Second, to reduce noise during the interaction between labeled and unlabeled data, we propose a Channel-selective Router~(CR) component, which dynamically selects the most relevant channels for information exchange. This mechanism ensures that only highly relevant features are activated, minimizing unnecessary interference. Finally, the Bidirectional Channel-wise Interaction~(BCI) strategy is employed to supplement additional semantic information and enhance the representation of important channels. Experimental results on multiple benchmarking 3D medical datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing semi-supervised approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

Nevertheless, their real-time deployment on edge platforms remains constrained by decoder complexity. Herein, we introduce LightFormer, a lightweight decoder for time-critical tasks that involve unstructured targets, such as disaster assessment, unmanned aerial vehicle search-and-rescue, and cultural heritage monitoring. LightFormer employs a feature-fusion and refinement module built on channel processing and a learnable gating mechanism to aggregate multi-scale, multi-range information efficiently, which drastically curtails model complexity. Furthermore, we propose a spatial information selection module (SISM) that integrates long-range attention with a detail preservation branch to capture spatial dependencies across multiple scales, thereby substantially improving the recognition of unstructured targets in complex scenes. On the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark, LightFormer attains 99.9% of GLFFNet's mIoU (83.9% vs. 84.0%) while requiring only 14.7% of its FLOPs and 15.9% of its parameters, thus achieving an excellent accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Consistent results on LoveDA, ISPRS Potsdam, RescueNet, and FloodNet further demonstrate its robustness and superior perception of unstructured objects. These findings highlight LightFormer as a practical solution for remote sensing applications where both computational economy and high-precision segmentation are imperative.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript was submitted without obtaining the consent of the other co-authors.

These large curve ensembles facilitate inferences about important changes when comparing and contrasting images. We introduce novel pattern recognition formalisms combined with inference methods over large ensembles of segmented curves. Our formalism involves accurately approximating eigenspaces of composite integral operators to motivate discrete, dual representations of curves collocated at quadrature nodes. Approximations are projected onto underlying matrix manifolds and the resulting separable shape tensors constitute rigid-invariant decompositions of curves into generalized (linear) scale variations and complementary (nonlinear) undulations. With thousands of curves segmented from pairs of images, we demonstrate how data-driven features of separable shape tensors inform explainable binary classification utilizing a product maximum mean discrepancy; absent labeled data, building interpretable feature spaces in seconds without high performance computation, and detecting discrepancies below cursory visual inspections.</p></details> | 32 pages, 16 figures |

To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{TokenSeg}, a boundary-aware sparse token representation framework for efficient 3D medical volume segmentation. Specifically, (1) we design a \emph{multi-scale hierarchical encoder} that extracts 400 candidate tokens across four resolution levels to capture both global anatomical context and fine boundary details; (2) we introduce a \emph{boundary-aware tokenizer} that combines VQ-VAE quantization with importance scoring to select 100 salient tokens, over 60\% of which lie near tumor boundaries; and (3) we develop a \emph{sparse-to-dense decoder} that reconstructs full-resolution masks through token reprojection, progressive upsampling, and skip connections. Extensive experiments on a 3D breast DCE-MRI dataset comprising 960 cases demonstrate that TokenSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance with 94.49\% Dice and 89.61\% IoU, while reducing GPU memory and inference latency by 64\% and 68\%, respectively. To verify the generalization capability, our evaluations on MSD cardiac and brain MRI benchmark datasets demonstrate that TokenSeg consistently delivers optimal performance across heterogeneous anatomical structures. These results highlight the effectiveness of anatomically informed sparse representation for accurate and efficient 3D medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning for 3D Medical Image Segmentation with Noisy Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03875v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient 3D affinely equivariant CNNs with adaptive fusion of augmented spherical Fourier-Bessel bases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16825v5)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Filter-decomposition-based group equivariant convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising stability and data efficiency for 3D image feature extraction. However, these networks, which rely on parameter sharing and discrete transformation groups, often underperform in modern deep neural network architectures for processing volumetric images with dense 3D textures, such as the common 3D medical images. To address these limitations, this paper presents an efficient non-parameter-sharing continuous 3D affine group equivariant neural network for volumetric images. This network uses an adaptive aggregation of Monte Carlo augmented spherical Fourier-Bessel filter bases to improve the efficiency and flexibility of 3D group equivariant CNNs for volumetric data. Unlike existing methods that focus only on angular orthogonality in filter bases, the introduced spherical Bessel Fourier filter base incorporates both angular and radial orthogonality to improve feature extraction. Experiments on four medical image segmentation datasets and two seismic datasets show that the proposed methods achieve better affine group equivariance and superior segmentation accuracy than existing 3D group equivariant convolutional neural network layers, significantly improving the training stability and data efficiency of conventional CNN layers (at 0.05 significance level).

Existing methods typically employ uniform fusion and refinement strategies across the entire image, which often introduces unnecessary linguistic perturbations in visually clear regions while failing to provide sufficient disambiguation in confused areas. To address this, we propose an \textbf{uncertainty-guided framework} that explicitly leverages a pixel-wise \textbf{referring uncertainty map} as a spatial prior to orchestrate adaptive inference. Specifically, we introduce a plug-and-play \textbf{Referring Uncertainty Scorer (RUS)}, which is trained via an online error-consistency supervision strategy to interpretably predict the spatial distribution of referential ambiguity. Building on this prior, we design two plug-and-play modules: 1) \textbf{Uncertainty-Gated Fusion (UGF)}, which dynamically modulates language injection strength to enhance constraints in high-uncertainty regions while suppressing noise in low-uncertainty ones; and 2) \textbf{Uncertainty-Driven Local Refinement (UDLR)}, which utilizes uncertainty-derived soft masks to focus refinement on error-prone boundaries and fine details. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method functions as a unified, plug-and-play solution that significantly improves robustness and geometric fidelity in complex remote sensing scenes without altering the backbone architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Agnostic and Holistic Universal Image Segmentation with Bit Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02881v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a diffusion-based framework for universal image segmentation, making agnostic segmentation possible without depending on mask-based frameworks and instead predicting the full segmentation in a holistic manner. We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.</p></details> | Accepted at NLDL 26 |
| **[An Uncertainty-Aware Generalization Framework for Cardiovascular Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14305v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have achieved significant success in segmenting cardiovascular structures, but there is a growing need to improve their generalization and robustness. Current methods often face challenges such as overfitting and limited accuracy, largely due to their reliance on large annotated datasets and limited optimization techniques. This paper introduces the UU-Mamba model, an extension of the U-Mamba architecture, designed to address these challenges in both cardiac and vascular segmentation. By incorporating Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), the model enhances generalization by seeking flatter minima in the loss landscape. Additionally, we propose an uncertainty-aware loss function that integrates region-based, distribution-based, and pixel-based components, improving segmentation accuracy by capturing both local and global features. We expand our evaluations on the ImageCAS (coronary artery) and Aorta (aortic branches and zones) datasets, which present more complex segmentation challenges than the ACDC dataset (left and right ventricles) used in prior work, showcasing the model's adaptability and resilience. Our results confirm UU-Mamba's superior performance compared to leading models such as TransUNet, Swin-Unet, nnUNet, and nnFormer. We also provide a more in-depth assessment of the model's robustness and segmentation accuracy through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical image segmentation remains challenging due to its limited adaptability across diverse medical domains. Although fine-tuned variants, such as MedSAM, improve performance in scenarios similar to the training modalities or organs, they may lack generalizability to unseen data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a lightweight and flexible framework that preserves SAM's inherent generalization ability while enhancing segmentation accuracy for medical images. SAM-TTA tackles two major challenges: (1) input-level discrepancy caused by channel mismatches between natural and medical images, and (2) semantic-level discrepancy due to different object characteristics in natural versus medical images (e.g., with clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). To this end, we introduce two complementary components: a self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which maps single-channel medical images into SAM-compatible three-channel images via a few learnable parameters to be optimized at test time; and IoU-guided Multi-scale Adaptation (IMA), which leverages SAM's intrinsic IoU scores to enforce high output confidence, dual-scale prediction consistency, and intermediate feature consistency, to improve semantic-level alignments. Extensive experiments on eight public medical image segmentation tasks, covering six grayscale and two color (endoscopic) tasks, demonstrate that SAM-TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods. Notably, on six grayscale datasets, SAM-TTA even surpasses fully fine-tuned models, achieving significant Dice improvements (i.e., average 4.8% and 7.4% gains over MedSAM and SAM-Med2D) and establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Towards Any-Quality Image Segmentation via Generative and Adaptive Latent Space Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02018v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Models (SAMs), known for their exceptional zero-shot segmentation performance, have garnered significant attention in the research community. Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM++ significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Furthermore, GleSAM++ also performs well on unseen degradations, underscoring the versatility of our approach and dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Diffu...</summary><p>Diffusion-based latent space enhancement helps improve the robustness of SAM</p></details> |

Existing vision-language models, which primarily rely on backbone architectures or CLIP-based embedding learning, demonstrate inherent limitations in fine-grained spatial localization and operational capabilities. This paper introduces SJTU: Spatial Judgments in Multimodal Models - Towards Unified Segmentation through Coordinate Detection, a framework that leverages spatial coordinate understanding to bridge vision-language interaction and precise segmentation, enabling accurate target identification through natural language instructions. The framework presents an approach for integrating segmentation techniques with vision-language models through spatial inference in multimodal space. By utilizing normalized coordinate detection for bounding boxes and transforming them into actionable segmentation outputs, we establish a connection between spatial and language representations in multimodal architectures. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across benchmark datasets, achieving IoU scores of 0.5958 on COCO 2017 and 0.6758 on Pascal VOC. Testing on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 512x512 resolution images yields an average inference time of 7 seconds per image, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in both accuracy and practical deployability.

Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, these results are achieved with significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and substantially lower computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical settings due to the scarcity of annotated data resulting from the professional and private nature of medical data. Although various cross-domain strategies have been explored, including frequency-based approaches that vary appearance while preserving semantics, many remain limited by data constraints and computational cost. To tackle domain shifts in data-scarce medical scenarios, we propose a Random frequency filtering enabled Single-source Domain Generalization algorithm (RaffeSDG), which promises robust out-of-domain inference with segmentation models trained on a single-source domain. A frequency filter-based data augmentation strategy is first proposed to promote domain variability within a single-source domain by introducing variations in frequency space and blending homologous samples. Then Gaussian filter-based structural saliency is also leveraged to learn robust representations across augmented samples, further facilitating the training of generalizable segmentation models. To validate the effectiveness of RaffeSDG, we conducted extensive experiments involving out-of-domain inference on segmentation tasks for three human tissues imaged by four diverse modalities. Through thorough investigations and comparisons, compelling evidence was observed in these experiments, demonstrating the potential and generalizability of RaffeSDG.

Although convolutional networks provide local precision at $\mathcal{O}(n)$ cost but limited receptive fields, vision transformers achieve global context through $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ self-attention at prohibitive computational expense, causing overfitting on small clinical datasets. We propose S2M-Net, a 4.7M-parameter architecture that achieves $\mathcal{O}(HW \log HW)$ global context through two synergistic innovations: (i) Spectral-Selective Token Mixer (SSTM), which exploits the spectral concentration of medical images via truncated 2D FFT with learnable frequency filtering and content-gated spatial projection, avoiding quadratic attention cost while maintaining global receptive fields; and (ii) Morphology-Aware Adaptive Segmentation Loss (MASL), which automatically analyzes structure characteristics (compactness, tubularity, irregularity, scale) to modulate five complementary loss components through constrained learnable weights, eliminating manual per-dataset tuning. Comprehensive evaluation in 16 medical imaging datasets that span 8 modalities demonstrates state-of-the-art performance: 96.12\% Dice on polyp segmentation, 83.77\% on surgical instruments (+17.85\% over the prior art) and 80.90\% on brain tumors, with consistent 3-18\% improvements over specialized baselines while using 3.5--6$\times$ fewer parameters than transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network with Limited Medical Annotations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01005v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation faces critical challenges in semi-supervised learning scenarios due to severe annotation scarcity requiring expert radiological knowledge, significant inter-annotator variability across different viewpoints and expertise levels, and inadequate multi-scale feature integration for precise boundary delineation in complex anatomical structures. Existing semi-supervised methods demonstrate substantial performance degradation compared to fully supervised approaches, particularly in small target segmentation and boundary refinement tasks. To address these fundamental challenges, we propose SASNet (Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network), a dual-branch architecture that leverages both low-level and high-level feature representations through novel scale-aware adaptive reweight mechanisms. Our approach introduces three key methodological innovations, including the Scale-aware Adaptive Reweight strategy that dynamically weights pixel-wise predictions using temporal confidence accumulation, the View Variance Enhancement mechanism employing 3D Fourier domain transformations to simulate annotation variability, and segmentation-regression consistency learning through signed distance map algorithms for enhanced boundary precision. These innovations collectively address the core limitations of existing semi-supervised approaches by integrating spatial, temporal, and geometric consistency principles within a unified optimization framework. Comprehensive evaluation across LA, Pancreas-CT, and BraTS datasets demonstrates that SASNet achieves superior performance with limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods while approaching fully supervised performance levels.

In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images. LNU-Net is derived from layer normalization (LN) U-Net architecture, while IBU-Net is derived from the instance-batch normalized (IB) U-Net for medical image segmentation. The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing. Our dataset that contains 805 MRI images regarding the left ventricle from 45 patients is used for evaluation. We experimentally evaluate the results of the proposed approaches outperforming the dice coefficient and the average perpendicular distance than other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, published in ICBBB 2022</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduced Med-2D SegNet, a novel and highly efficient segmentation architecture that delivers outstanding accuracy while maintaining a minimal computational footprint. Med-2D SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including KVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.77% across 20 diverse datasets. Central to its success is the compact Med Block, a specialized encoder design that incorporates dimension expansion and parameter reduction, enabling precise feature extraction while keeping model parameters to a low count of just 2.07 million. Med-2D SegNet excels in cross-dataset generalization, particularly in polyp segmentation, where it was trained on KVASIR-SEG and showed strong performance on unseen datasets, demonstrating its robustness in zero-shot learning scenarios, even though we acknowledge that further improvements are possible. With top-tier performance in both binary and multi-class segmentation, Med-2D SegNet redefines the balance between accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark for medical image analysis. This work paves the way for developing accessible, high-performance diagnostic tools suitable for clinical environments and resource-constrained settings, making it a step forward in the democratization of advanced medical technology.</p></details> |  |

Traditional test-time augmentation (TTA) techniques typically rely on predefined geometric and photometric transformations, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness in complex medical scenarios. In this study, we introduced Test-Time Generative Augmentation (TTGA), a novel augmentation strategy specifically tailored for medical image segmentation at inference time. Different from conventional augmentation strategies that suffer from excessive randomness or limited flexibility, TTGA leverages a domain-fine-tuned generative model to produce contextually relevant and diverse augmentations tailored to the characteristics of each test image. Built upon diffusion model inversion, a masked null-text inversion method is proposed to enable region-specific augmentations during sampling. Furthermore, a dual denoising pathway is designed to balance precise identity preservation with controlled variability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our TTGA through extensive experiments across three distinct segmentation tasks spanning nine datasets. Our results consistently demonstrate that TTGA not only improves segmentation accuracy (with DSC gains ranging from 0.1% to 2.3% over the baseline) but also offers pixel-wise error estimation (with DSC gains ranging from 1.1% to 29.0% over the baseline).

However, robust segmentation remains a challenge in complex scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes a cascaded convolutional neural network integrated with a novel Global Information Guidance Module. This module is designed to effectively fuse low-level texture details with high-level semantic features across multiple layers, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of single-scale feature extraction. This architectural innovation significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, particularly in visually cluttered or blurred environments where traditional methods often fail. Experimental evaluations on benchmark image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior precision, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of the approach and its promising potential for deployment in practical robotic applications.</p></details> |  |

However, many advanced models employ complex architectures, limiting their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. This paper proposes MFEnNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework that incorporates MetaFormer in the encoding phase of the U-Net backbone. MetaFormer, an architectural abstraction of vision transformers, provides a versatile alternative to convolutional neural networks by transforming tokenized image patches into sequences for global context modeling. To mitigate the substantial computational cost associated with self-attention, the proposed framework replaces conventional transformer modules with pooling transformer blocks, thereby achieving effective global feature aggregation at reduced complexity. In addition, Swish activation is used to achieve smoother gradients and faster convergence, while spatial pyramid pooling is incorporated at the bottleneck to improve multi-scale feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on different medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MFEnNet approach attains competitive accuracy while significantly lowering computational cost compared to state-of-the-art models.

In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space.

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA creates valid augmented samples from the data distribution with high diversity, properties we theoretically show that are essential for a Test-Time Augmentation method to be effective. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost. Our comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, pneumonia detection, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often rely on {implicit} cross-view radar feature association, such as proposal pairing in RFMask or query-to-feature cross-attention in RETR, which can lead to ambiguous feature matches and degraded detection in complex indoor scenes. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{REXO} (multi-view Radar object dEtection with 3D bounding boX diffusiOn), which lifts the 2D bounding box (BBox) diffusion process of DiffusionDet into the 3D radar space. REXO utilizes these noisy 3D BBoxes to guide an {explicit} cross-view radar feature association, enhancing the cross-view radar-conditioned denoising process. By accounting for prior knowledge that the person is in contact with the ground, REXO reduces the number of diffusion parameters by determining them from this prior. Evaluated on two open indoor radar datasets, our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods by a margin of +4.22 AP on the HIBER dataset and +11.02 AP on the MMVR dataset.

In contrast to traditional approaches, GenDet adopts a pioneering approach by leveraging generative modeling: it conditions on the input image and directly generates bounding boxes with semantic annotations in the original image space. GenDet establishes a conditional generation architecture built upon the large-scale pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, formulating the detection task as semantic constraints within the latent space. It enables precise control over bounding box positions and category attributes, while preserving the flexibility of the generative model. This novel methodology effectively bridges the gap between generative models and discriminative tasks, providing a fresh perspective for constructing unified visual understanding systems. Systematic experiments demonstrate that GenDet achieves competitive accuracy compared to discriminative detectors, while retaining the flexibility characteristic of generative methods.</p></details> |  |

Our pipeline operates in two stages: (1) a YOLO-based object detection model trained on Mapillary Vistas and fine-tuned on BillboardLamac images achieved 94% mAP@50 in the billboard detection task (2) a classifier based on the detected bounding box positions and DINOv2 features. The proposed pipeline enables estimation of billboard driver gaze duration from individual frames. We show that our method is able to achieve 68.1% accuracy on BillboardLamac when considering individual frames. These results are further validated using images collected from Google Street View.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a position paper at VISAPP 2026</p></details> |

| **[Shape-Aware Topological Representation for Pipeline Hyperbola Detection in GPR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06311v3)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) is a widely used Non-Destructive Testing (NDT) technique for subsurface exploration, particularly in infrastructure inspection and maintenance. However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |
| **[RealCamo: Boosting Real Camouflage Synthesis with Layout Controls and Textual-Visual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22974v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose RealCamo, a novel out-painting-based framework for controllable realistic camouflaged image generation. RealCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multimodal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Practical Continual Forgetting for Pre-trained Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09705v2)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For privacy and security concerns, the need to erase unwanted information from pre-trained vision models is becoming evident nowadays. In real-world scenarios, erasure requests originate at any time from both users and model owners, and these requests usually form a sequence. Therefore, under such a setting, selective information is expected to be continuously removed from a pre-trained model while maintaining the rest. We define this problem as continual forgetting and identify three key challenges. (i) For unwanted knowledge, efficient and effective deleting is crucial. (ii) For remaining knowledge, the impact brought by the forgetting procedure should be minimal. (iii) In real-world scenarios, the training samples may be scarce or partially missing during the process of forgetting. To address them, we first propose Group Sparse LoRA (GS-LoRA). Specifically, towards (i), we introduce Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) modules to fine-tune the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers in Transformer blocks for each forgetting task independently, and towards (ii), a simple group sparse regularization is adopted, enabling automatic selection of specific LoRA groups and zeroing out the others. To further extend GS-LoRA to more practical scenarios, we incorporate prototype information as additional supervision and introduce a more practical approach, GS-LoRA++. For each forgotten class, we move the logits away from its original prototype. For the remaining classes, we pull the logits closer to their respective prototypes. We conduct extensive experiments on face recognition, object detection, and image classification and demonstrate that our method manages to forget specific classes with minimal impact on other classes. Codes have been released on https://github.com/bjzhb666/GS-LoRA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TPAMI. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2403.11530</p></details> |
| **[SpecDETR: A transformer-based hyperspectral point object detection network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10148v5)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral target detection (HTD) aims to identify specific materials based on spectral information in hyperspectral imagery and can detect extremely small-sized objects, some of which occupy a smaller than one-pixel area. However, existing HTD methods are developed based on per-pixel binary classification, neglecting the three-dimensional cube structure of hyperspectral images (HSIs) that integrates both spatial and spectral dimensions. The synergistic existence of spatial and spectral features in HSIs enable objects to simultaneously exhibit both, yet the per-pixel HTD framework limits the joint expression of these features. In this paper, we rethink HTD from the perspective of spatial-spectral synergistic representation and propose hyperspectral point object detection as an innovative task framework. We introduce SpecDETR, the first specialized network for hyperspectral multi-class point object detection, which eliminates dependence on pre-trained backbone networks commonly required by vision-based object detectors. SpecDETR uses a multi-layer Transformer encoder with self-excited subpixel-scale attention modules to directly extract deep spatial-spectral joint features from hyperspectral cubes. We develop a simulated hyperspectral point object detection benchmark termed SPOD, and for the first time, evaluate and compare the performance of visual object detection networks and HTD methods on hyperspectral point object detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed SpecDETR outperforms SOTA visual object detection networks and HTD methods. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/ZhaoxuLi123/SpecDETR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Training Vision Language Models for Remote Sensing Multi-task Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21272v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With Transformers achieving outstanding performance on individual remote sensing (RS) tasks, we are now approaching the realization of a unified model that excels across multiple tasks through multi-task learning (MTL). Compared to single-task approaches, MTL methods offer improved generalization, enhanced scalability, and greater practical applicability. Recently, vision language models (VLMs) have achieved promising results in RS image understanding, grounding, and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) image reasoning, respectively. Moreover, the unified text-based interface demonstrates significant potential for MTL. Hence, in this work, we present RSCoVLM, a simple yet flexible VLM baseline for RS MTL. Firstly, we create the data curation engine, including data acquisition, offline processing and integrating, as well as online loading and weighting. This data engine effectively addresses complex RS data enviroment and generates flexible vision-language conversations. Furthermore, we propose a unified dynamic-resolution strategy to address the diverse image scales inherent in RS imagery. For UHR images, we introduce the Zoom-in Chain mechanism together with its corresponding dataset, LRS-VQA-Zoom. The strategies are flexible and effectively mitigate the computational burdens. Additionally, we significantly enhance the model's object detection capability and propose a novel evaluation protocol that ensures fair comparison between VLMs and conventional detection models. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RSCoVLM achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks, outperforming existing RS VLMs and even rivaling specialized expert models. All the training and evaluating tools, model weights, and datasets have been fully open-sourced to support reproducibility. We expect that this baseline will promote further progress toward general-purpose RS models.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating for Multimodal Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18291v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection in aerial imagery is a critical task in applications such as UAV reconnaissance. Although existing methods have extensively explored feature interaction between different modalities, they commonly rely on simple fusion strategies for feature aggregation. This introduces two critical flaws: it is prone to cross-modal noise and disrupts the hierarchical structure of the feature pyramid, thereby impairing the fine-grained detection of small objects. To address this challenge, we propose the Pyramidal Adaptive Cross-Gating Network (PACGNet), an architecture designed to perform deep fusion within the backbone. To this end, we design two core components: the Symmetrical Cross-Gating (SCG) module and the Pyramidal Feature-aware Multimodal Gating (PFMG) module. The SCG module employs a bidirectional, symmetrical "horizontal" gating mechanism to selectively absorb complementary information, suppress noise, and preserve the semantic integrity of each modality. The PFMG module reconstructs the feature hierarchy via a progressive hierarchical gating mechanism. This leverages the detailed features from a preceding, higher-resolution level to guide the fusion at the current, lower-resolution level, effectively preserving fine-grained details as features propagate. Through evaluations conducted on the DroneVehicle and VEDAI datasets, our PACGNet sets a new state-of-the-art benchmark, with mAP50 scores reaching 82.2% and 82.1% respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Image and Vision Computing</p></details> |

However, most existing architectures still trade accuracy for latency, which limits their applicability on microcontroller and neural processing unit based devices. In this work, we introduce two new model families, STResNet for image classification and STYOLO for object detection, jointly optimized for accuracy, efficiency, and memory footprint on resource constrained platforms. The proposed STResNet series, ranging from Nano to Tiny variants, achieves competitive ImageNet 1K accuracy within a four million parameter budget. Specifically, STResNetMilli attains 70.0 percent Top 1 accuracy with only three million parameters, outperforming MobileNetV1 and ShuffleNetV2 at comparable computational complexity. For object detection, STYOLOMicro and STYOLOMilli achieve 30.5 percent and 33.6 percent mean average precision, respectively, on the MS COCO dataset, surpassing YOLOv5n and YOLOX Nano in both accuracy and efficiency. Furthermore, when STResNetMilli is used as a backbone with the Ultralytics training environment.</p></details> | 9 pages, 1 figure |

In this work we tackle this bottleneck by leveraging temporal-geometric consistency across LiDAR sweeps to lift and fuse cues from text and 2D vision foundation models directly into 3D, without any manual input. We introduce an unsupervised multi-modal pseudo-labeling method relying on strong geometric priors learned from temporally accumulated LiDAR maps, alongside with a novel iterative update rule that enforces joint geometric-semantic consistency, and vice-versa detecting moving objects from inconsistencies. Our method simultaneously produces 3D semantic labels, 3D bounding boxes, and dense LiDAR scans, demonstrating robust generalization across three datasets. We experimentally validate that our method compares favorably to existing semantic segmentation and object detection pseudo-labeling methods, which often require additional manual supervision. We confirm that even a small fraction of our geometrically consistent, densified LiDAR improves depth prediction by 51.5% and 22.0% MAE in the 80-150 and 150-250 meters range, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Estimating when a document was written and tracing the development of scripts and writing styles can be aided by identifying the individual scribes who contributed to a medieval manuscript. Although digital technologies have made significant progress in this field, the general problem remains unsolved and continues to pose open challenges. ... We previously proposed an approach focused on identifying specific letters or abbreviations that characterize each writer. In that study, we considered the letter "a", as it was widely present on all pages of text and highly distinctive, according to the suggestions of expert paleographers. We used template matching techniques to detect the occurrences of the character "a" on each page and the convolutional neural network (CNN) to attribute each instance to the correct scribe. Moving from the interesting results achieved from this previous system and being aware of the limitations of the template matching technique, which requires an appropriate threshold to work, we decided to experiment in the same framework with the use of the YOLO object detection model to identify the scribe who contributed to the writing of different medieval books. We considered the fifth version of YOLO to implement the YOLO object detection model, which completely substituted the template matching and CNN used in the previous work. The experimental results demonstrate that YOLO effectively extracts a greater number of letters considered, leading to a more accurate second-stage classification. Furthermore, the YOLO confidence score provides a foundation for developing a system that applies a rejection threshold, enabling reliable writer identification even in unseen manuscripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table.

While foundation models excel in single-modal contexts, integrating their capabilities across diverse sensors like cameras and LiDAR to create a unified understanding remains a formidable challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive framework for multi-modal pre-training, identifying the core set of techniques driving progress toward this goal. We dissect the interplay between foundational sensor characteristics and learning strategies, evaluating the role of platform-specific datasets in enabling these advancements. Our central contribution is the formulation of a unified taxonomy for pre-training paradigms: ranging from single-modality baselines to sophisticated unified frameworks that learn holistic representations for advanced tasks like 3D object detection and semantic occupancy prediction. Furthermore, we investigate the integration of textual inputs and occupancy representations to facilitate open-world perception and planning. Finally, we identify critical bottlenecks, such as computational efficiency and model scalability, and propose a roadmap toward general-purpose multi-modal foundation models capable of achieving robust Spatial Intelligence for real-world deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Surve...</summary><p>Survey; 40 pages, 7 figures, 9 tables; GitHub Repo at https://github.com/worldbench/awesome-spatial-intelligence</p></details> |

To tackle it, we introduce the first generalized cross-domain few-shot (GCFS) task in 3D object detection, aiming to adapt a source-pretrained model to both common and novel classes in a new domain with only few-shot annotations. We propose a unified framework that learns stable target semantics under limited supervision by bridging 2D open-set semantics with 3D spatial reasoning. Specifically, an image-guided multi-modal fusion injects transferable 2D semantic cues into the 3D pipeline via vision-language models, while a physically-aware box search enhances 2D-to-3D alignment via LiDAR priors. To capture class-specific semantics from sparse data, we further introduce contrastive-enhanced prototype learning, which encodes few-shot instances into discriminative semantic anchors and stabilizes representation learning. Extensive experiments on GCFS benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our approach in realistic deployment settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>The l...</summary><p>The latest version refines the few-shot setting on common classes, enforcing a stricter object-level definition</p></details> |
| **[Few-Shot LoRA Adaptation of a Flow-Matching Foundation Model for Cross-Spectral Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04381v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for vision are predominantly trained on RGB data, while many safety-critical applications rely on non-visible modalities such as infrared (IR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR). We study whether a single flow-matching foundation model pre-trained primarily on RGB images can be repurposed as a cross-spectral translator using only a few co-measured examples, and whether the resulting synthetic data can enhance downstream detection. Starting from FLUX.1 Kontext, we insert low-rank adaptation (LoRA) modules and fine-tune them on just 100 paired images per domain for two settings: RGB to IR on the KAIST dataset and RGB to SAR on the M4-SAR dataset. The adapted model translates RGB images into pixel-aligned IR/SAR, enabling us to reuse existing bounding boxes and train object detection models purely in the target modality. Across a grid of LoRA hyperparameters, we find that LPIPS computed on only 50 held-out pairs is a strong proxy for downstream performance: lower LPIPS consistently predicts higher mAP for YOLOv11n on both IR and SAR, and for DETR on KAIST IR test data. Using the best LPIPS-selected LoRA adapter, synthetic IR from external RGB datasets (LLVIP, FLIR ADAS) improves KAIST IR pedestrian detection, and synthetic SAR significantly boosts infrastructure detection on M4-SAR when combined with limited real SAR. Our results suggest that few-shot LoRA adaptation of flow-matching foundation models is a promising path toward foundation-style support for non-visible modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SortWaste: A Densely Annotated Dataset for Object Detection in Industrial Waste Sorting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02299v2)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing production of waste, driven by population growth, has created challenges in managing and recycling materials effectively. Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap). In addition to these contributions, we provide an extensive benchmark of state-of-the-art object detection models, detailing their results with respect to the hardness level assessed by the proposed metric. Despite achieving promising results (mAP of 59.7% in the plastic-only detection task), performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes. This highlights the need for novel and more challenging datasets on the topic.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We contend that over-reliance on machine learning technology is the main reason. Use of automated commonsense reasoning technology, we believe, can help achieve SAE Level 5 autonomy. In this paper, we show how automated common-sense reasoning technology can be deployed in situations where there are not enough data samples available to train a deep learning-based AV model that can handle certain abnormal road scenarios. Specifically, we consider two situations where (i) a traffic signal is malfunctioning at an intersection and (ii) all the cars ahead are slowing down and steering away due to an unexpected obstruction (e.g., animals on the road). We show that in such situations, our commonsense reasoning-based solution accurately detects traffic light colors and obstacles not correctly captured by the AV's perception model. We also provide a pathway for efficiently invoking commonsense reasoning by measuring uncertainty in the computer vision model and using commonsense reasoning to handle uncertain scenarios. We describe our experiments conducted using the CARLA simulator and the results obtained. The main contribution of our research is to show that automated commonsense reasoning effectively corrects AV-based object detection misclassifications and that hybrid models provide an effective pathway to improving AV perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |

Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 1 table, presented at 4th International Conference on Responsible Consumption and Production, https://link.springer.com/book/9783032173546</p></details> |

While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.</p></details> |  |

We systematically evaluate how depth backbones and feature engineering affect a monocular Pseudo-LiDAR pipeline on the KITTI validation split. Specifically, we compare NeWCRFs (supervised metric depth) against Depth Anything V2 Metric-Outdoor (Base) under an identical pseudo-LiDAR generation and PointRCNN detection protocol. NeWCRFs yields stronger downstream 3D detection, achieving 10.50\% AP$_{3D}$ at IoU$=0.7$ on the Moderate split using grayscale intensity (Exp~2). We further test point-cloud augmentations using appearance cues (grayscale intensity) and semantic cues (instance segmentation confidence). Contrary to the expectation that semantics would substantially close the gap, these features provide only marginal gains, and mask-based sampling can degrade performance by removing contextual geometry. Finally, we report a depth-accuracy-versus-distance diagnostic using ground-truth 2D boxes (including Ped/Cyc), highlighting that coarse depth correctness does not fully predict strict 3D IoU. Overall, under an off-the-shelf LiDAR detector, depth-backbone choice and geometric fidelity dominate performance, outweighing secondary feature injection.</p></details> | 7 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Physics-Constrained Cross-Resolution Enhancement Network for Optics-Guided Thermal UAV Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03526v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods often suffer from temporal inconsistencies, manifesting as flickering effects that degrade temporal coherence and adversely affect downstream decision-making. While recent approaches incorporate historical information to alleviate this issue, they often incur high computational costs and may introduce misaligned or redundant features that interfere with object detection. We propose OccLinker, a novel plugin framework that can be easily integrated into existing VONs to improve performance. Our method efficiently consolidates historical static and motion cues, learns sparse latent correlations with current features through a dual cross-attention mechanism, and generates correction occupancy components to refine the base network predictions. In addition, we introduce a new temporal consistency metric to quantitatively measure flickering effects. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance with minimal computational overhead while effectively reducing flickering artifacts.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient 3D Object Detection for Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaboration via Risk-Intent Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03001v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.</p></details> |  |

However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo, OpenVLA and Pi Zero. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking. Code and supplementary material are publicly available on the project website at https://lab-rococo-sapienza.github.io/lost-3dsg/.</p></details> |  |

However, they often function as autistic observers, capable of tracing geometric paths but blind to the semantic \textit{what} and \textit{why} behind object behaviors. To bridge the gap between geometric perception and cognitive reasoning, we propose \textbf{LLMTrack}, a novel end-to-end framework for Semantic Multi-Object Tracking (SMOT). We adopt a bionic design philosophy that decouples strong localization from deep understanding, utilizing Grounding DINO as the eyes and the LLaVA-OneVision multimodal large model as the brain. We introduce a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module that aggregates instance-level interaction features and video-level contexts, enabling the Large Language Model (LLM) to comprehend complex trajectories. Furthermore, we design a progressive three-stage training strategy, Visual Alignment, Temporal Fine-tuning, and Semantic Injection via LoRA to efficiently adapt the massive model to the tracking domain. Extensive experiments on the BenSMOT benchmark demonstrate that LLMTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing methods in instance description, interaction recognition, and video summarization while maintaining robust tracking stability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Perception Test 2025: Challenge Summary and a Unified VQA Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06287v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Third Perception Test challenge was organised as a full-day workshop alongside the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV) 2025. Its primary goal is to benchmark state-of-the-art video models and measure the progress in multimodal perception. This year, the workshop featured 2 guest tracks as well: KiVA (an image understanding challenge) and Physic-IQ (a video generation challenge). In this report, we summarise the results from the main Perception Test challenge, detailing both the existing tasks as well as novel additions to the benchmark. In this iteration, we placed an emphasis on task unification, as this poses a more challenging test for current SOTA multimodal models. The challenge included five consolidated tracks: unified video QA, unified object and point tracking, unified action and sound localisation, grounded video QA, and hour-long video QA, alongside an analysis and interpretability track that is still open for submissions. Notably, the unified video QA track introduced a novel subset that reformulates traditional perception tasks (such as point tracking and temporal action localisation) as multiple-choice video QA questions that video-language models can natively tackle. The unified object and point tracking merged the original object tracking and point tracking tasks, whereas the unified action and sound localisation merged the original temporal action localisation and temporal sound localisation tracks. Accordingly, we required competitors to use unified approaches rather than engineered pipelines with task-specific models. By proposing such a unified challenge, Perception Test 2025 highlights the significant difficulties existing models face when tackling diverse perception tasks through unified interfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT Scans As Video: Efficient Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Using Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02521v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-MOT: Autoregressive Multi-object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01925v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Decoupling Amplitude and Phase Attention in Frequency Domain for RGB-Event based Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01022v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenEvTracking</p></details> |  |
| **[CropTrack: A Tracking with Re-Identification Framework for Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24838v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Memory Design in SAM-Based Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22624v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones. Code is available at: https://github.com/HamadYA/SAM3_Tracking_Zoo. \textbf{This is a preprint.

| **[KV-Tracker: Real-Time Pose Tracking with Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22581v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-view 3D geometry networks offer a powerful prior but are prohibitively slow for real-time applications. We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marwan99.github.io/kv_tracker</p></details> |
| **[Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/Robotmurlock/TDLP}{https://github.com/Robotmurlock/TDLP}.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (+4 for references), 8 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[TrackTeller: Temporal Multimodal 3D Grounding for Behavior-Dependent Object References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21641v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v3)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.</p></details> | 33 pages, 27figures |

While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |

The methodology is thus for joint tracking and intent recognition. Several latent intent models are proposed here within a virtual leader formulation. They capture the influence of the target's hidden goal on its instantaneous behaviour. In this context, various motion models, including for highly maneuvering objects, are also considered. The a priori unknown target intent (e.g. destination) can dynamically change over time and take any value within the state space (e.g. a location or spatial region). A sequential Monte Carlo (particle filtering) approach is introduced for the simultaneous estimation of the target's (kinematic) state and its intent. Rao-Blackwellisation is employed to enhance the statistical performance of the inference routine. Simulated data and real radar measurements are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (T-AES)</p></details> |

However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing formulations assume an "offline" setting with full video access at query time, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with power and storage-constrained wearable devices. Towards more application-ready episodic memory systems, we introduce Online Visual Query 2D (OVQ2D), a task where models process video streams online, observing each frame only once, and retrieve object localizations using a compact memory instead of full video history. We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.</p></details> | <details><summary>in IE...</summary><p>in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Application of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments.

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics.

| **[Beyond Proximity: A Keypoint-Trajectory Framework for Classifying Affiliative and Agonistic Social Networks in Dairy Cattle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14998v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision livestock farming requires objective assessment of social behavior to support herd welfare monitoring, yet most existing approaches infer interactions using static proximity thresholds that cannot distinguish affiliative from agonistic behaviors in complex barn environments. This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

| **[Quadratic Kalman Filter for Elliptical Extended Object Tracking based on Decoupling State Components](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14426v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extended object tracking involves estimating both the physical extent and kinematic parameters of a target object, where typically multiple measurements are observed per time step. In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> |

Inspired by query-based tracking frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISAPP 2026</p></details> |

RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeafTrackNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Robust Leaf Tracking in Top-Down Plant Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13130v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/shl-shawn/LeafTrackNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light Field Based 6DoF Tracking of Previously Unobserved Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13007v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds.

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes.

The goal is to understand better current limitations in state-of-the-art trackers by providing more detailed insights on the behavior of these trackers. We show that overall the trackers DAM4SAM and SAMURAI perform well on more challenging sequences.</p></details> |  |

Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/MHLA/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/MHLA/</p></details> |

Unlike previous datasets that focus on common visual scenes with statistical frequency advantages, UAIT challenges models with grammatically reasonable but semantically counter-common sense image-text pairs. Such tasks require models to go beyond superficial pattern recognition and demonstrate a deep understanding of agent-patient relationships and physical feasibility. To build UAIT, we designed a semi-automated process to synthesize high-quality uncommon-sense image-text samples using large language models, few-shot prompt engineering, and text-to-image generation. Each sample is accompanied by a carefully designed multiple-choice question to test the model's competence in fine-grained reasoning. We evaluate multiple state-of-the-art visual language models and compare them with models based on contrastive learning. Experiments show that all models perform significantly worse than humans in semantic judgment, especially in distinguishing grammatical correctness from semantic rationality. Further experiments show that even the lightweight model can improve its accuracy after fine-tuning, demonstrating the great potential of directional adaptation. This study not only reveals the key weaknesses of VLMs, but also provides diagnostic tools and research directions for the development of robust models with real visual semantic reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DyDiT++: Diffusion Transformers with Timestep and Spatial Dynamics for Efficient Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06803v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

However, compared to text-to-image generation, there is still a large gap to enclose. Current approaches use two stages to tackle this task: speech encoding network and image generative adversarial network (GAN). The speech encoding networks in these approaches produce embeddings that do not capture sufficient linguistic information to semantically represent the input speech. GANs suffer from issues such as non-convergence, mode collapse, and diminished gradient, which result in unstable model parameters, limited sample diversity, and ineffective generator learning, respectively. To address these weaknesses, we introduce a framework called Speak the Art (STA) which consists of a speech encoding network and a VQ-Diffusion network conditioned on speech embeddings. To improve speech embeddings, the speech encoding network is supervised by a large pre-trained image-text model during training. Replacing GANs with diffusion leads to more stable training and the generation of diverse images. Additionally, we investigate the feasibility of extending our framework to be multilingual. As a proof of concept, we trained our framework with two languages: English and Arabic. Finally, we show that our results surpass state-of-the-art models by a large margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlexVAR: Flexible Visual Autoregressive Modeling without Residual Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20313v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work challenges the residual prediction paradigm in visual autoregressive modeling and presents FlexVAR, a new Flexible Visual AutoRegressive image generation paradigm. FlexVAR facilitates autoregressive learning with ground-truth prediction, enabling each step to independently produce plausible images. This simple, intuitive approach swiftly learns visual distributions and makes the generation process more flexible and adaptable. Trained solely on low-resolution images ($\leq$ 256px), FlexVAR can: (1) Generate images of various resolutions and aspect ratios, even exceeding the resolution of the training images. (2) Support various image-to-image tasks, including image refinement, in/out-painting, and image expansion. (3) Adapt to various autoregressive steps, allowing for faster inference with fewer steps or enhancing image quality with more steps. Our 1.0B model outperforms its VAR counterpart on the ImageNet 256$\times$256 benchmark. Moreover, when zero-shot transfer the image generation process with 13 steps, the performance further improves to 2.08 FID, outperforming state-of-the-art autoregressive models AiM/VAR by 0.25/0.28 FID and popular diffusion models LDM/DiT by 1.52/0.19 FID, respectively. When transferring our 1.0B model to the ImageNet 512$\times$512 benchmark in a zero-shot manner, FlexVAR achieves competitive results compared to the VAR 2.3B model, which is a fully supervised model trained at 512$\times$512 resolution.</p></details> |  |

In contrast to traditional approaches, GenDet adopts a pioneering approach by leveraging generative modeling: it conditions on the input image and directly generates bounding boxes with semantic annotations in the original image space. GenDet establishes a conditional generation architecture built upon the large-scale pre-trained Stable Diffusion model, formulating the detection task as semantic constraints within the latent space. It enables precise control over bounding box positions and category attributes, while preserving the flexibility of the generative model. This novel methodology effectively bridges the gap between generative models and discriminative tasks, providing a fresh perspective for constructing unified visual understanding systems. Systematic experiments demonstrate that GenDet achieves competitive accuracy compared to discriminative detectors, while retaining the flexibility characteristic of generative methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperFlow: Training Flow Matching Models with RL on the Fly](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17951v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in flow-based generative models and reinforcement learning (RL) has improved text-image alignment and visual quality. However, current RL training for flow models still has two main problems: (i) GRPO-style fixed per-prompt group sizes ignore variation in sampling importance across prompts, which leads to inefficient sampling and slower training; and (ii) trajectory-level advantages are reused as per-step estimates, which biases credit assignment along the flow. We propose SuperFlow, an RL training framework for flow-based models that adjusts group sizes with variance-aware sampling and computes step-level advantages in a way that is consistent with continuous-time flow dynamics. Empirically, SuperFlow reaches promising performance while using only 5.4% to 56.3% of the original training steps and reduces training time by 5.2% to 16.7% without any architectural changes. On standard text-to-image (T2I) tasks, including text rendering, compositional image generation, and human preference alignment, SuperFlow improves over SD3.5-M by 4.6% to 47.2%, and over Flow-GRPO by 1.7% to 16.0%.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Paris: A Decentralized Trained Open-Weight Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03434v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Paris, the first publicly released diffusion model pre-trained entirely through decentralized computation. Paris demonstrates that high-quality text-to-image generation can be achieved without centrally coordinated infrastructure. Paris is open for research and commercial use. Paris required implementing our Distributed Diffusion Training framework from scratch. The model consists of 8 expert diffusion models (129M-605M parameters each) trained in complete isolation with no gradient, parameter, or intermediate activation synchronization. Rather than requiring synchronized gradient updates across thousands of GPUs, we partition data into semantically coherent clusters where each expert independently optimizes its subset while collectively approximating the full distribution. A lightweight transformer router dynamically selects appropriate experts at inference, achieving generation quality comparable to centrally coordinated baselines. Eliminating synchronization enables training on heterogeneous hardware without specialized interconnects. Empirical validation confirms that Paris's decentralized training maintains generation quality while removing the dedicated GPU cluster requirement for large-scale diffusion models. Paris achieves this using 14$\times$ less training data and 16$\times$ less compute than the prior decentralized baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[RealCamo: Boosting Real Camouflage Synthesis with Layout Controls and Textual-Visual Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22974v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Camouflaged image generation (CIG) has recently emerged as an efficient alternative for acquiring high-quality training data for camouflaged object detection (COD). However, existing CIG methods still suffer from a substantial gap to real camouflaged imagery: generated images either lack sufficient camouflage due to weak visual similarity, or exhibit cluttered backgrounds that are semantically inconsistent with foreground targets. To address these limitations, we propose RealCamo, a novel out-painting-based framework for controllable realistic camouflaged image generation. RealCamo explicitly introduces additional layout controls to regulate global image structure, thereby improving semantic coherence between foreground objects and generated backgrounds. Moreover, we construct a multimodal textual-visual condition by combining a unified fine-grained textual task description with texture-oriented background retrieval, which jointly guides the generation process to enhance visual fidelity and realism. To quantitatively assess camouflage quality, we further introduce a background-foreground distribution divergence metric that measures the effectiveness of camouflage in generated images. Extensive experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[FashionMAC: Deformation-Free Fashion Image Generation with Fine-Grained Model Appearance Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14031v2)** | 2026-01-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Garment-centric fashion image generation aims to synthesize realistic and controllable human models dressing a given garment, which has attracted growing interest due to its practical applications in e-commerce. The key challenges of the task lie in two aspects: (1) faithfully preserving the garment details, and (2) gaining fine-grained controllability over the model's appearance. Existing methods typically require performing garment deformation in the generation process, which often leads to garment texture distortions. Also, they fail to control the fine-grained attributes of the generated models, due to the lack of specifically designed mechanisms. To address these issues, we propose FashionMAC, a novel diffusion-based deformation-free framework that achieves high-quality and controllable fashion showcase image generation. The core idea of our framework is to eliminate the need for performing garment deformation and directly outpaint the garment segmented from a dressed person, which enables faithful preservation of the intricate garment details. Moreover, we propose a novel region-adaptive decoupled attention (RADA) mechanism along with a chained mask injection strategy to achieve fine-grained appearance controllability over the synthesized human models. Specifically, RADA adaptively predicts the generated regions for each fine-grained text attribute and enforces the text attribute to focus on the predicted regions by a chained mask injection strategy, significantly enhancing the visual fidelity and the controllability. Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of our framework compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sissi: Zero-shot Style-guided Image Synthesis via Semantic-style Integration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06605v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided image generation has advanced rapidly with large-scale diffusion models, yet achieving precise stylization with visual exemplars remains difficult. Existing approaches often depend on task-specific retraining or expensive inversion procedures, which can compromise content integrity, reduce style fidelity, and lead to an unsatisfactory trade-off between semantic prompt adherence and style alignment. In this work, we introduce a training-free framework that reformulates style-guided synthesis as an in-context learning task. Guided by textual semantic prompts, our method concatenates a reference style image with a masked target image, leveraging a pretrained ReFlow-based inpainting model to seamlessly integrate semantic content with the desired style through multimodal attention fusion. We further analyze the imbalance and noise sensitivity inherent in multimodal attention fusion and propose a Dynamic Semantic-Style Integration (DSSI) mechanism that reweights attention between textual semantic and style visual tokens, effectively resolving guidance conflicts and enhancing output coherence. Experiments show that our approach achieves high-fidelity stylization with superior semantic-style balance and visual quality, offering a simple yet powerful alternative to complex, artifact-prone prior methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[APEX: Learning Adaptive Priorities for Multi-Objective Alignment in Vision-Language Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06574v1)** | 2026-01-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective alignment for text-to-image generation is commonly implemented via static linear scalarization, but fixed weights often fail under heterogeneous rewards, leading to optimization imbalance where models overfit high-variance, high-responsiveness objectives (e.g., OCR) while under-optimizing perceptual goals. We identify two mechanistic causes: variance hijacking, where reward dispersion induces implicit reweighting that dominates the normalized training signal, and gradient conflicts, where competing objectives produce opposing update directions and trigger seesaw-like oscillations. We propose APEX (Adaptive Priority-based Efficient X-objective Alignment), which stabilizes heterogeneous rewards with Dual-Stage Adaptive Normalization and dynamically schedules objectives via P^3 Adaptive Priorities that combine learning potential, conflict penalty, and progress need. On Stable Diffusion 3.5, APEX achieves improved Pareto trade-offs across four heterogeneous objectives, with balanced gains of +1.31 PickScore, +0.35 DeQA, and +0.53 Aesthetics while maintaining competitive OCR accuracy, mitigating the instability of multi-objective alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Circuit Mechanisms for Spatial Relation Generation in Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06338v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have greatly advanced text-to-image generation, but models still struggle to generate the correct spatial relations between objects as specified in the text prompt. In this study, we adopt a mechanistic interpretability approach to investigate how a DiT can generate correct spatial relations between objects. We train, from scratch, DiTs of different sizes with different text encoders to learn to generate images containing two objects whose attributes and spatial relations are specified in the text prompt. We find that, although all the models can learn this task to near-perfect accuracy, the underlying mechanisms differ drastically depending on the choice of text encoder. When using random text embeddings, we find that the spatial-relation information is passed to image tokens through a two-stage circuit, involving two cross-attention heads that separately read the spatial relation and single-object attributes in the text prompt. When using a pretrained text encoder (T5), we find that the DiT uses a different circuit that leverages information fusion in the text tokens, reading spatial-relation and single-object information together from a single text token. We further show that, although the in-domain performance is similar for the two settings, their robustness to out-of-domain perturbations differs, potentially suggesting the difficulty of generating correct relations in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 31 pages, 23 figures |
| **[PixelArena: A benchmark for Pixel-Precision Visual Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16303v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal models that have multimodal input and output are emerging. However, benchmarking their multimodal generation, especially in image generation, is challenging due to the subtleties of human preferences and model biases. Many image generation benchmarks focus on aesthetics instead of the fine-grained generation capabilities of these models, failing to evaluate their visual intelligence with objective metrics. In PixelArena, we propose using semantic segmentation tasks to objectively examine their fine-grained generative intelligence with pixel precision. With our benchmark and experiments, we find the latest Gemini 3 Pro Image has emergent image generation capabilities that generate semantic masks with high fidelity under zero-shot settings, showcasing visual intelligence unseen before and true generalization in new image generation tasks. We further investigate its results, compare them qualitatively and quantitatively with those of other models, and present failure cases. The findings not only signal exciting progress in the field but also provide insights into future research related to dataset development, omni-modal model development, and the design of metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures, project page: https://pixelarena.reify.ing/project</p></details> |
| **[3D-WAG: Hierarchical Wavelet-Guided Autoregressive Generation for High-Fidelity 3D Shapes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19037v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable success in natural language and image generation, but their application to 3D shape modeling remains largely unexplored. Unlike diffusion models, AR models enable more efficient and controllable generation with faster inference times, making them especially suitable for data-intensive domains. Traditional 3D generative models using AR approaches often rely on ``next-token" predictions at the voxel or point level. While effective for certain applications, these methods can be restrictive and computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale 3D data. To tackle these challenges, we introduce 3D-WAG, an AR model for 3D implicit distance fields that can perform unconditional shape generation, class-conditioned and also text-conditioned shape generation. Our key idea is to encode shapes as multi-scale wavelet token maps and use a Transformer to predict the ``next higher-resolution token map" in an autoregressive manner. By redefining 3D AR generation task as ``next-scale" prediction, we reduce the computational cost of generation compared to traditional ``next-token" prediction models, while preserving essential geometric details of 3D shapes in a more structured and hierarchical manner. We evaluate 3D-WAG to showcase its benefit by quantitative and qualitative comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on widely used benchmarks. Our results show 3D-WAG achieves superior performance in key metrics like Coverage and MMD, generating high-fidelity 3D shapes that closely match the real data distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenCtrl -- A Formal Controllability Toolkit for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05637v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative models become ubiquitous, there is a critical need for fine-grained control over the generation process. Yet, while controlled generation methods from prompting to fine-tuning proliferate, a fundamental question remains unanswered: are these models truly controllable in the first place? In this work, we provide a theoretical framework to formally answer this question. Framing human-model interaction as a control process, we propose a novel algorithm to estimate the controllable sets of models in a dialogue setting. Notably, we provide formal guarantees on the estimation error as a function of sample complexity: we derive probably-approximately correct bounds for controllable set estimates that are distribution-free, employ no assumptions except for output boundedness, and work for any black-box nonlinear control system (i.e., any generative model). We empirically demonstrate the theoretical framework on different tasks in controlling dialogue processes, for both language models and text-to-image generation. Our results show that model controllability is surprisingly fragile and highly dependent on the experimental setting. This highlights the need for rigorous controllability analysis, shifting the focus from simply attempting control to first understanding its fundamental limits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Video Generation Models Are Good Latent Reward Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21541v3)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward feedback learning (ReFL) has proven effective for aligning image generation with human preferences. However, its extension to video generation faces significant challenges. Existing video reward models rely on vision-language models designed for pixel-space inputs, confining ReFL optimization to near-complete denoising steps after computationally expensive VAE decoding. This pixel-space approach incurs substantial memory overhead and increased training time, and its late-stage optimization lacks early-stage supervision, refining only visual quality rather than fundamental motion dynamics and structural coherence. In this work, we show that pre-trained video generation models are naturally suited for reward modeling in the noisy latent space, as they are explicitly designed to process noisy latent representations at arbitrary timesteps and inherently preserve temporal information through their sequential modeling capabilities. Accordingly, we propose Process Reward Feedback Learning~(PRFL), a framework that conducts preference optimization entirely in latent space, enabling efficient gradient backpropagation throughout the full denoising chain without VAE decoding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PRFL significantly improves alignment with human preferences, while achieving substantial reductions in memory consumption and training time compared to RGB ReFL.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttriCtrl: Fine-Grained Control of Aesthetic Attribute Intensity in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02151v2)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have recently become the dominant paradigm for image generation, yet existing systems struggle to interpret and follow numeric instructions for adjusting semantic attributes. In real-world creative scenarios, especially when precise control over aesthetic attributes is required, current methods fail to provide such controllability. This limitation partly arises from the subjective and context-dependent nature of aesthetic judgments, but more fundamentally stems from the fact that current text encoders are designed for discrete tokens rather than continuous values. Meanwhile, efforts on aesthetic alignment, often leveraging reinforcement learning, direct preference optimization, or architectural modifications, primarily align models with a global notion of human preference. While these approaches improve user experience, they overlook the multifaceted and compositional nature of aesthetics, underscoring the need for explicit disentanglement and independent control of aesthetic attributes. To address this gap, we introduce AttriCtrl, a lightweight framework for continuous aesthetic intensity control in diffusion models. It first defines relevant aesthetic attributes, then quantifies them through a hybrid strategy that maps both concrete and abstract dimensions onto a unified $[0,1]$ scale. A plug-and-play value encoder is then used to transform user-specified values into model-interpretable embeddings for controllable generation. Experiments show that AttriCtrl achieves accurate and continuous control over both single and multiple aesthetic attributes, significantly enhancing personalization and diversity. Crucially, it is implemented as a lightweight adapter while keeping the diffusion model frozen, ensuring seamless integration with existing frameworks such as ControlNet at negligible computational cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[MoGen: A Unified Collaborative Framework for Controllable Multi-Object Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05546v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-object image generation methods face difficulties in achieving precise alignment between localized image generation regions and their corresponding semantics based on language descriptions, frequently resulting in inconsistent object quantities and attribute aliasing. To mitigate this limitation, mainstream approaches typically rely on external control signals to explicitly constrain the spatial layout, local semantic and visual attributes of images. However, this strong dependency makes the input format rigid, rendering it incompatible with the heterogeneous resource conditions of users and diverse constraint requirements. To address these challenges, we propose MoGen, a user-friendly multi-object image generation method. First, we design a Regional Semantic Anchor (RSA) module that precisely anchors phrase units in language descriptions to their corresponding image regions during the generation process, enabling text-to-image generation that follows quantity specifications for multiple objects. Building upon this foundation, we further introduce an Adaptive Multi-modal Guidance (AMG) module, which adaptively parses and integrates various combinations of multi-source control signals to formulate corresponding structured intent. This intent subsequently guides selective constraints on scene layouts and object attributes, achieving dynamic fine-grained control. Experimental results demonstrate that MoGen significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, quantity consistency, and fine-grained control, while exhibiting superior accessibility and control flexibility.

| **[Coding the Visual World: From Image to Simulation Using Vision Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05344v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to construct mental models of the world is a central aspect of understanding. Similarly, visual understanding can be viewed as the ability to construct a representative model of the system depicted in an image. This work explores the capacity of Vision Language Models (VLMs) to recognize and simulate the systems and mechanisms depicted in images using the Im2Sim methodology. The VLM is given a natural image of a real-world system (e.g., cities, clouds, vegetation) and is tasked with describing the system and writing code that simulates and generates it. This generative code is then executed to produce a synthetic image, which is compared against the original. This approach is tested on various complex emergent systems, ranging from physical systems (waves, lights, clouds) to vegetation, cities, materials, and geological formations. Through analysis of the models and images generated by the VLMs, we examine their understanding of the systems in images. The results show that leading VLMs (GPT, Gemini) demonstrate the capacity to understand and model complex, multi-component systems across multiple layers of abstraction and a wide range of domains. At the same time, the VLMs exhibit limited ability to replicate fine details and low-level arrangements of patterns in the image. These findings reveal an interesting asymmetry: VLMs combine high-level, deep visual understanding of images with limited perception of fine details.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Clinical Text and Class Conditioning for 3D Prostate MRI Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10230v3)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Objective: Latent diffusion models (LDM) could alleviate data scarcity challenges affecting machine learning development for medical imaging. However, medical LDM strategies typically rely on short-prompt text encoders, nonmedical LDMs, or large data volumes. These strategies can limit performance and scientific accessibility. We propose a novel LDM conditioning approach to address these limitations. Methods: We propose Class-Conditioned Efficient Large Language model Adapter (CCELLA), a novel dual-head conditioning approach that simultaneously conditions the LDM U-Net with free-text clinical reports and radiology classification. We also propose a data-efficient LDM pipeline centered around CCELLA and a proposed joint loss function. We first evaluate our method on 3D prostate MRI against state-of-the-art. We then augment a downstream classifier model training dataset with synthetic images from our method. Results: Our method achieves a 3D FID score of 0.025 on a size-limited 3D prostate MRI dataset, significantly outperforming a recent foundation model with FID 0.070. When training a classifier for prostate cancer prediction, adding synthetic images generated by our method during training improves classifier accuracy from 69% to 74% and outperforms classifiers trained on images generated by prior state-of-the-art. Classifier training solely on our method's synthetic images achieved comparable performance to real image training. Conclusion: We show that our method improved both synthetic image quality and downstream classifier performance using limited data and minimal human annotation. Significance: The proposed CCELLA-centric pipeline enables radiology report and class-conditioned LDM training for high-quality medical image synthesis given limited data volume and human data annotation, improving LDM performance and scientific accessibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, 2025.

| **[Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05149v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive (AR) models have achieved remarkable success in image synthesis, yet their sequential nature imposes significant latency constraints. Speculative Decoding offers a promising avenue for acceleration, but existing approaches are limited by token-level ambiguity and lack of spatial awareness. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale Local Speculative Decoding (MuLo-SD), a novel framework that combines multi-resolution drafting with spatially informed verification to accelerate AR image generation. Our method leverages a low-resolution drafter paired with learned up-samplers to propose candidate image tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a high-resolution target model. Crucially, we incorporate a local rejection and resampling mechanism, enabling efficient correction of draft errors by focusing on spatial neighborhoods rather than raster-scan resampling after the first rejection. We demonstrate that MuLo-SD achieves substantial speedups - up to $\mathbf{1.7\times}$ - outperforming strong speculative decoding baselines such as EAGLE-2 and LANTERN in terms of acceleration, while maintaining comparable semantic alignment and perceptual quality. These results are validated using GenEval, DPG-Bench, and FID/HPSv2 on the MS-COCO 5k validation split. Extensive ablations highlight the impact of up-sampling design, probability pooling, and local rejection and resampling with neighborhood expansion. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in speculative decoding for image synthesis, bridging the gap between efficiency and fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page is available at https://qualcomm-ai-research.github.io/mulo-sd-webpage</p></details> |

Although recent unified multimodal models exhibit promising understanding capabilities, these strengths often fail to transfer effectively to image generation. We introduce Re-Align, a unified framework that bridges the gap between understanding and generation through structured reasoning-guided alignment. At its core lies the In-Context Chain-of-Thought (IC-CoT), a structured reasoning paradigm that decouples semantic guidance and reference association, providing clear textual target and mitigating confusion among reference images. Furthermore, Re-Align introduces an effective RL training scheme that leverages a surrogate reward to measure the alignment between structured reasoning text and the generated image, thereby improving the model's overall performance on ICGE tasks. Extensive experiments verify that Re-Align outperforms competitive methods of comparable model scale and resources on both in-context image generation and editing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, project page: https://github.com/hrz2000/realign</p></details> |
| **[Exponential capacity scaling of classical GANs compared to hybrid latent style-based quantum GANs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05036v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum generative modeling is a very active area of research in looking for practical advantage in data analysis. Quantum generative adversarial networks (QGANs) are leading candidates for quantum generative modeling and have been applied to diverse areas, from high-energy physics to image generation. The latent style-based QGAN, relying on a classical variational autoencoder to encode the input data into a latent space and then using a style-based QGAN for data generation has been proven to be efficient for image generation or drug design, hinting at the use of far less trainable parameters than their classical counterpart to achieve comparable performance, however this advantage has never been systematically studied. We present in this work the first comprehensive experimental analysis of this advantage of QGANS applied to SAT4 image generation, obtaining an exponential advantage in capacity scaling for a quantum generator in the hybrid latent style-based QGAN architecture. Careful tuning of the autoencoder is crucial to obtain stable, reliable results. Once this tuning is performed and defining training optimality as when the training is stable and the FID score is low and stable as well, the optimal capacity (or number of trainable parameters) of the classical discriminator scales exponentially with respect to the capacity of the quantum generator, and the same is true for the capacity of the classical generator. This hints toward a type of quantum advantage for quantum generative modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

We present OnomaCompass, a web-based exploration system that links sound-symbolic onomatopoeia and visual texture representations to support early-stage material discovery. Instead of requiring users to craft precise prompts for generative AI, OnomaCompass provides two coordinated latent-space maps--one for texture images and one for onomatopoeic term--built from an authored dataset of invented onomatopoeia and corresponding textures generated via Stable Diffusion. Users can navigate both spaces, trigger cross-modal highlighting, curate findings in a gallery, and preview textures applied to objects via an image-editing model. The system also supports video interpolation between selected textures and re-embedding of extracted frames to form an emergent exploration loop. We conducted a within-subjects study with 11 participants comparing OnomaCompass to a prompt-based image-generation workflow using Gemini 2.5 Flash Image ("Nano Banana"). OnomaCompass significantly reduced workload (NASA-TLX overall, mental demand, effort, and frustration; p < .05) and increased hedonic user experience (UEQ), while usability (SUS) favored the baseline. Qualitative findings indicate that OnomaCompass helps users externalize vague sensory expectations and promotes serendipitous discovery, but also reveals interaction challenges in spatial navigation. Overall, leveraging sound symbolism as a lightweight cue offers a complementary approach to Kansei-driven material ideation beyond prompt-centric generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCorn: Towards Self-Improving Unified Multimodal Models through Self-Generated Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03193v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agentic Retoucher for Text-To-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02046v2)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models such as SDXL and FLUX have achieved impressive photorealism, yet small-scale distortions remain pervasive in limbs, face, text and so on. Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[SRU-Pix2Pix: A Fusion-Driven Generator Network for Medical Image Translation with Few-Shot Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04785v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides detailed tissue information, but its clinical application is limited by long acquisition time, high cost, and restricted resolution. Image translation has recently gained attention as a strategy to address these limitations. Although Pix2Pix has been widely applied in medical image translation, its potential has not been fully explored. In this study, we propose an enhanced Pix2Pix framework that integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation Residual Networks (SEResNet) and U-Net++ to improve image generation quality and structural fidelity. SEResNet strengthens critical feature representation through channel attention, while U-Net++ enhances multi-scale feature fusion. A simplified PatchGAN discriminator further stabilizes training and refines local anatomical realism. Experimental results demonstrate that under few-shot conditions with fewer than 500 images, the proposed method achieves consistent structural fidelity and superior image quality across multiple intra-modality MRI translation tasks, showing strong generalization ability. These results suggest an effective extension of Pix2Pix for medical image translation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forge-and-Quench: Enhancing Image Generation for Higher Fidelity in Unified Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04706v1)** | 2026-01-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integrating image generation and understanding into a single framework has become a pivotal goal in the multimodal domain. However, how understanding can effectively assist generation has not been fully explored. Unlike previous works that focus on leveraging reasoning abilities and world knowledge from understanding models, this paper introduces a novel perspective: leveraging understanding to enhance the fidelity and detail richness of generated images. To this end, we propose Forge-and-Quench, a new unified framework that puts this principle into practice. In the generation process of our framework, an MLLM first reasons over the entire conversational context, including text instructions, to produce an enhanced text instruction. This refined instruction is then mapped to a virtual visual representation, termed the Bridge Feature, via a novel Bridge Adapter. This feature acts as a crucial link, forging insights from the understanding model to quench and refine the generation process. It is subsequently injected into the T2I backbone as a visual guidance signal, alongside the enhanced text instruction that replaces the original input. To validate this paradigm, we conduct comprehensive studies on the design of the Bridge Feature and Bridge Adapter. Our framework demonstrates exceptional extensibility and flexibility, enabling efficient migration across different MLLM and T2I models with significant savings in training overhead, all without compromising the MLLM's inherent multimodal understanding capabilities. Experiments show that Forge-and-Quench significantly improves image fidelity and detail across multiple models, while also maintaining instruction-following accuracy and enhancing world knowledge application. Models and codes are available at https://github.com/YanbingZeng/Forge-and-Quench.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods rely on Euclidean space metrics, neglecting the structured nature of semantic alignment, while lacking adaptive capabilities for different samples. To address these limitations, we propose HyperAlign, an adaptive text-to-image alignment assessment framework based on hyperbolic entailment geometry. First, we extract Euclidean features using CLIP and map them to hyperbolic space. Second, we design a dynamic-supervision entailment modeling mechanism that transforms discrete entailment logic into continuous geometric structure supervision. Finally, we propose an adaptive modulation regressor that utilizes hyperbolic geometric features to generate sample-level modulation parameters, adaptively calibrating Euclidean cosine similarity to predict the final score. HyperAlign achieves highly competitive performance on both single database evaluation and cross-database generalization tasks, fully validating the effectiveness of hyperbolic geometric modeling for image-text alignment assessment.</p></details> |  |
