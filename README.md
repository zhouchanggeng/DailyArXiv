| **[CLIP Won't Learn Object-Attribute Binding from Natural Data and Here is Why](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of "a yellow submarine and a blue bus" or "a blue submarine and a yellow bus". Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in the arguably most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is "most salient" to them have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties CLIP learns almost perfect binding.</p></details> |  |
| **[MolCLIP: A Molecular-Auxiliary CLIP Framework for Identifying Drug Mechanism of Action Based on Time-Lapsed Mitochondrial Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07663v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drug Mechanism of Action (MoA) mainly investigates how drug molecules interact with cells, which is crucial for drug discovery and clinical application. Recently, deep learning models have been used to recognize MoA by relying on high-content and fluorescence images of cells exposed to various drugs. However, these methods focus on spatial characteristics while overlooking the temporal dynamics of live cells. Time-lapse imaging is more suitable for observing the cell response to drugs. Additionally, drug molecules can trigger cellular dynamic variations related to specific MoA. This indicates that the drug molecule modality may complement the image counterpart. This paper proposes MolCLIP, the first visual language model to combine microscopic cell video- and molecule-modalities. MolCLIP designs a molecule-auxiliary CLIP framework to guide video features in learning the distribution of the molecular latent space. Furthermore, we integrate a metric learning strategy with MolCLIP to optimize the aggregation of video features. Experimental results on the MitoDataset demonstrate that MolCLIP achieves improvements of 51.2% and 20.5% in mAP for drug identification and MoA recognition, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization of Probabilistic Constellation Shaping for Optical OFDM Systems with Clipping Distortion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07507v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optical orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) and probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) have emerged as powerful techniques to enhance the performance of optical wireless communications (OWC) systems. While PCS improves spectral efficiency and adaptability, we show that its integration with optical OFDM can inadvertently increase the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) of the signal, exacerbating clipping distortion due to signal clipping. This letter investigates the impact of PCS on the PAPR of direct current-biased optical OFDM (DCO-OFDM) waveforms and proposes an optimization of PCS that maximizes channel capacity, considering clipping distortion. The optimization problem is shown to be complex and non-convex. We thus present a suboptimal yet efficient solving approach based on projected gradient descent to solve the problem. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over the conventional uniform signaling, particularly under severe clipping distortion conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Label-Efficient Chest X-ray Diagnosis via Partial CLIP Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07254v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern deep learning implementations for medical imaging usually rely on large labeled datasets. These datasets are often difficult to obtain due to privacy concerns, high costs, and even scarcity of cases. In this paper, a label-efficient strategy is proposed for chest X-ray diagnosis that seeks to reflect real-world hospital scenarios. The experiments use the NIH Chest X-ray14 dataset and a pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 model. The model is adapted via partial fine-tuning of its visual encoder and then evaluated using zero-shot and few-shot learning with 1-16 labeled examples per disease class. The tests demonstrate that CLIP's pre-trained vision-language features can be effectively adapted to few-shot medical imaging tasks, achieving over 20\% improvement in mean AUC score as compared to the zero-shot baseline. The key aspect of this work is to attempt to simulate internal hospital workflows, where image archives exist but annotations are sparse. This work evaluates a practical and scalable solution for both common and rare disease diagnosis. Additionally this research is intended for academic and experimental purposes only and has not been peer reviewed yet.

| **[From Gradient Clipping to Normalization for Heavy Tailed SGD](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13849v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent empirical evidence indicates that many machine learning applications involve heavy-tailed gradient noise, which challenges the standard assumptions of bounded variance in stochastic optimization. Gradient clipping has emerged as a popular tool to handle this heavy-tailed noise, as it achieves good performance in this setting both theoretically and practically. However, our current theoretical understanding of non-convex gradient clipping has three main shortcomings. First, the theory hinges on large, increasing clipping thresholds, which are in stark contrast to the small constant clipping thresholds employed in practice. Second, clipping thresholds require knowledge of problem-dependent parameters to guarantee convergence. Lastly, even with this knowledge, current sampling complexity upper bounds for the method are sub-optimal in nearly all parameters. To address these issues, we study convergence of Normalized SGD (NSGD). First, we establish a parameter-free sample complexity for NSGD of $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{2p}{p-1}}\right)$ to find an $\varepsilon$-stationary point. Furthermore, we prove tightness of this result, by providing a matching algorithm-specific lower bound. In the setting where all problem parameters are known, we show this complexity is improved to $\mathcal{O}\left(\varepsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\right)$, matching the previously known lower bound for all first-order methods in all problem dependent parameters. Finally, we establish high-probability convergence of NSGD with a mild logarithmic dependence on the failure probability. Our work complements the studies of gradient clipping under heavy tailed noise improving the sample complexities of existing algorithms and offering an alternative mechanism to achieve high probability convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed a typo, and removed the abuse of notation in the proof of Theorem 4</p></details> |
| **[MADPOT: Medical Anomaly Detection with CLIP Adaptation and Partial Optimal Transport](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06733v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical anomaly detection (AD) is challenging due to diverse imaging modalities, anatomical variations, and limited labeled data. We propose a novel approach combining visual adapters and prompt learning with Partial Optimal Transport (POT) and contrastive learning (CL) to improve CLIP's adaptability to medical images, particularly for AD. Unlike standard prompt learning, which often yields a single representation, our method employs multiple prompts aligned with local features via POT to capture subtle abnormalities. CL further enforces intra-class cohesion and inter-class separation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results in few-shot, zero-shot, and cross-dataset scenarios without synthetic data or memory banks. The code is available at https://github.com/mahshid1998/MADPOT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIAP 2025 (this version is not peer-reviewed; it is the submitted version).

| **[Infrared and visible Image Fusion with Language-driven Loss in CLIP Embedding Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16267v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) has attracted much attention owing to the highly-complementary properties of the two image modalities. Due to the lack of ground-truth fused images, the fusion output of current deep-learning based methods heavily depends on the loss functions defined mathematically. As it is hard to well mathematically define the fused image without ground truth, the performance of existing fusion methods is limited. In this paper, we first propose to use natural language to express the objective of IVIF, which can avoid the explicit mathematical modeling of fusion output in current losses, and make full use of the advantage of language expression to improve the fusion performance. For this purpose, we present a comprehensive language-expressed fusion objective, and encode relevant texts into the multi-modal embedding space using CLIP. A language-driven fusion model is then constructed in the embedding space, by establishing the relationship among the embedded vectors to represent the fusion objective and input image modalities. Finally, a language-driven loss is derived to make the actual IVIF aligned with the embedded language-driven fusion model via supervised training. Experiments show that our method can obtain much better fusion results than existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM MM 2025</p></details> |
| **[MOST: Motion Diffusion Model for Rare Text via Temporal Clip Banzhaf Interaction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06590v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MOST, a novel motion diffusion model via temporal clip Banzhaf interaction, aimed at addressing the persistent challenge of generating human motion from rare language prompts. While previous approaches struggle with coarse-grained matching and overlook important semantic cues due to motion redundancy, our key insight lies in leveraging fine-grained clip relationships to mitigate these issues. MOST's retrieval stage presents the first formulation of its kind - temporal clip Banzhaf interaction - which precisely quantifies textual-motion coherence at the clip level. This facilitates direct, fine-grained text-to-motion clip matching and eliminates prevalent redundancy. In the generation stage, a motion prompt module effectively utilizes retrieved motion clips to produce semantically consistent movements. Extensive evaluations confirm that MOST achieves state-of-the-art text-to-motion retrieval and generation performance by comprehensively addressing previous challenges, as demonstrated through quantitative and qualitative results highlighting its effectiveness, especially for rare prompts.</p></details> |  |
| **[AdaDPIGU: Differentially Private SGD with Adaptive Clipping and Importance-Based Gradient Updates for Deep Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06525v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy has been proven effective for stochastic gradient descent; however, existing methods often suffer from performance degradation in high-dimensional settings, as the scale of injected noise increases with dimensionality. To tackle this challenge, we propose AdaDPIGU--a new differentially private SGD framework with importance-based gradient updates tailored for deep neural networks. In the pretraining stage, we apply a differentially private Gaussian mechanism to estimate the importance of each parameter while preserving privacy. During the gradient update phase, we prune low-importance coordinates and introduce a coordinate-wise adaptive clipping mechanism, enabling sparse and noise-efficient gradient updates. Theoretically, we prove that AdaDPIGU satisfies $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy and retains convergence guarantees. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks validate the effectiveness of AdaDPIGU. All results are reported under a fixed retention ratio of 60%. On MNIST, our method achieves a test accuracy of 99.12% under a privacy budget of $\epsilon = 8$, nearly matching the non-private model. Remarkably, on CIFAR-10, it attains 73.21% accuracy at $\epsilon = 4$, outperforming the non-private baseline of 71.12%, demonstrating that adaptive sparsification can enhance both privacy and utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[CultureCLIP: Empowering CLIP with Cultural Awareness through Synthetic Images and Contextualized Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06210v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP excel in multimodal understanding but struggle with contextually relevant fine-grained visual features, making it difficult to distinguish visually similar yet culturally distinct concepts. This limitation stems from the scarcity of high-quality culture-specific datasets, the lack of integrated contextual knowledge, and the absence of hard negatives highlighting subtle distinctions. To address these challenges, we first design a data curation pipeline that leverages open-sourced VLMs and text-to-image diffusion models to construct CulTwin, a synthetic cultural dataset. This dataset consists of paired concept-caption-image triplets, where concepts visually resemble each other but represent different cultural contexts. Then, we fine-tune CLIP on CulTwin to create CultureCLIP, which aligns cultural concepts with contextually enhanced captions and synthetic images through customized contrastive learning, enabling finer cultural differentiation while preserving generalization capabilities. Experiments on culturally relevant benchmarks show that CultureCLIP outperforms the base CLIP, achieving up to a notable 5.49% improvement in fine-grained concept recognition on certain tasks, while preserving CLIP's original generalization ability, validating the effectiveness of our data synthesis and VLM backbone training paradigm in capturing subtle cultural distinctions.</p></details> | 25 pages, COLM 2025 |
| **[CURVE: CLIP-Utilized Reinforcement Learning for Visual Image Enhancement via Simple Image Processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23102v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-Light Image Enhancement (LLIE) is crucial for improving both human perception and computer vision tasks. This paper addresses two challenges in zero-reference LLIE: obtaining perceptually 'good' images using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) model and maintaining computational efficiency for high-resolution images. We propose CLIP-Utilized Reinforcement learning-based Visual image Enhancement (CURVE). CURVE employs a simple image processing module which adjusts global image tone based on B\'ezier curve and estimates its processing parameters iteratively. The estimator is trained by reinforcement learning with rewards designed using CLIP text embeddings. Experiments on low-light and multi-exposure datasets demonstrate the performance of CURVE in terms of enhancement quality and processing speed compared to conventional methods.</p></details> | Accepted to ICIP2025 |
| **[Viewpoint Consistency in 3D Generation via Attention and CLIP Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02287v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Surrogate to Fool Them All: Universal, Transferable, and Targeted Adversarial Attacks with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19840v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved widespread success yet remain prone to adversarial attacks. Typically, such attacks either involve frequent queries to the target model or rely on surrogate models closely mirroring the target model -- often trained with subsets of the target model's training data -- to achieve high attack success rates through transferability. However, in realistic scenarios where training data is inaccessible and excessive queries can raise alarms, crafting adversarial examples becomes more challenging. In this paper, we present UnivIntruder, a novel attack framework that relies solely on a single, publicly available CLIP model and publicly available datasets. By using textual concepts, UnivIntruder generates universal, transferable, and targeted adversarial perturbations that mislead DNNs into misclassifying inputs into adversary-specified classes defined by textual concepts. Our extensive experiments show that our approach achieves an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of up to 85% on ImageNet and over 99% on CIFAR-10, significantly outperforming existing transfer-based methods. Additionally, we reveal real-world vulnerabilities, showing that even without querying target models, UnivIntruder compromises image search engines like Google and Baidu with ASR rates up to 84%, and vision language models like GPT-4 and Claude-3.5 with ASR rates up to 80%. These findings underscore the practicality of our attack in scenarios where traditional avenues are blocked, highlighting the need to reevaluate security paradigms in AI applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 15 figures, 18 tables.

| **[Semi-Supervised Defect Detection via Conditional Diffusion and CLIP-Guided Noise Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05588v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of industrial quality inspection, defect detection stands as a critical component, particularly in high-precision, safety-critical sectors such as automotive components aerospace, and medical devices. Traditional methods, reliant on manual inspection or early image processing algorithms, suffer from inefficiencies, high costs, and limited robustness. This paper introduces a semi-supervised defect detection framework based on conditional diffusion (DSYM), leveraging a two-stage collaborative training mechanism and a staged joint optimization strategy. The framework utilizes labeled data for initial training and subsequently incorporates unlabeled data through the generation of pseudo-labels. A conditional diffusion model synthesizes multi-scale pseudo-defect samples, while a CLIP cross-modal feature-based noise filtering mechanism mitigates label contamination. Experimental results on the NEU-DET dataset demonstrate a 78.4% mAP@0.5 with the same amount of labeled data as traditional supervised methods, and 75.1% mAP@0.5 with only 40% of the labeled data required by the original supervised model, showcasing significant advantages in data efficiency. This research provides a high-precision, low-labeling-dependent solution for defect detection in industrial quality inspection scenarios.

| **[AnatomyCarve: A VR occlusion management technique for medical images based on segment-aware clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05572v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visualizing 3D medical images is challenging due to self-occlusion, where anatomical structures of interest can be obscured by surrounding tissues. Existing methods, such as slicing and interactive clipping, are limited in their ability to fully represent internal anatomy in context. In contrast, hand-drawn medical illustrations in anatomy books manage occlusion effectively by selectively removing portions based on tissue type, revealing 3D structures while preserving context. This paper introduces AnatomyCarve, a novel technique developed for a VR environment that creates high-quality illustrations similar to those in anatomy books, while remaining fast and interactive. AnatomyCarve allows users to clip selected segments from 3D medical volumes, preserving spatial relations and contextual information. This approach enhances visualization by combining advanced rendering techniques with natural user interactions in VR. Usability of AnatomyCarve was assessed through a study with non-experts, while surgical planning effectiveness was evaluated with practicing neurosurgeons and residents. The results show that AnatomyCarve enables customized anatomical visualizations, with high user satisfaction, suggesting its potential for educational and clinical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-Guided Backdoor Defense through Entropy-Based Poisoned Dataset Separation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05113v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison training data to implant backdoor into the victim model. Current backdoor defenses on poisoned data often suffer from high computational costs or low effectiveness against advanced attacks like clean-label and clean-image backdoors. To address them, we introduce CLIP-Guided backdoor Defense (CGD), an efficient and effective method that mitigates various backdoor attacks. CGD utilizes a publicly accessible CLIP model to identify inputs that are likely to be clean or poisoned. It then retrains the model with these inputs, using CLIP's logits as a guidance to effectively neutralize the backdoor. Experiments on 4 datasets and 11 attack types demonstrate that CGD reduces attack success rates (ASRs) to below 1% while maintaining clean accuracy (CA) with a maximum drop of only 0.3%, outperforming existing defenses. Additionally, we show that clean-data-based defenses can be adapted to poisoned data using CGD. Also, CGD exhibits strong robustness, maintaining low ASRs even when employing a weaker CLIP model or when CLIP itself is compromised by a backdoor. These findings underscore CGD's exceptional efficiency, effectiveness, and applicability for real-world backdoor defense scenarios.

| **[Robust Federated Learning Over the Air: Combating Heavy-Tailed Noise with Median Anchored Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15100v6)** | 2025-07-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging over-the-air computations for model aggregation is an effective approach to cope with the communication bottleneck in federated edge learning. By exploiting the superposition properties of multi-access channels, this approach facilitates an integrated design of communication and computation, thereby enhancing system privacy while reducing implementation costs. However, the inherent electromagnetic interference in radio channels often exhibits heavy-tailed distributions, giving rise to exceptionally strong noise in globally aggregated gradients that can significantly deteriorate the training performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel gradient clipping method, termed Median Anchored Clipping (MAC), to combat the detrimental effects of heavy-tailed noise. We also derive analytical expressions for the convergence rate of model training with analog over-the-air federated learning under MAC, which quantitatively demonstrates the effect of MAC on training performance. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed MAC algorithm effectively mitigates the impact of heavy-tailed noise, hence substantially enhancing system robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the full version of the paper, and the appendix contains a complete convergence analysis under non-convex conditions</p></details> |
| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06035v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconstructing visual information from brain activity bridges the gap between neuroscience and computer vision. Even though progress has been made in decoding images from fMRI using generative models, a challenge remains in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from their elemental density and diversity, sophisticated spatial structures, and multifaceted semantic information. To address these challenges, we propose HAVIR that contains two adapters: (1) The AutoKL Adapter transforms fMRI voxels into a latent diffusion prior, capturing topological structures; (2) The CLIP Adapter converts the voxels to CLIP text and image embeddings, containing semantic information. These complementary representations are fused by Versatile Diffusion to generate the final reconstructed image. To extract the most essential semantic information from complex scenarios, the CLIP Adapter is trained with text captions describing the visual stimuli and their corresponding semantic images synthesized from these captions. The experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR effectively reconstructs both structural features and semantic information of visual stimuli even in complex scenarios, outperforming existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have decided to withdraw this paper because the baseline methods used for comparison are outdated and do not reflect the current state-of-the-art.

| **[Finetuning CLIP to Reason about Pairwise Differences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09721v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP are trained via contrastive learning between text and image pairs, resulting in aligned image and text embeddings that are useful for many downstream tasks. A notable drawback of CLIP, however, is that the resulting embedding space seems to lack some of the structure of its purely text-based alternatives. For instance, while text embeddings have long been noted to satisfy analogies in embedding space using vector arithmetic, CLIP has no such property. In this paper, we propose an approach to natively train CLIP in a contrastive manner to reason about differences in embedding space. We finetune CLIP so that text descriptions of differences between images correspond to their difference in image embedding space, using synthetically generated data with large language models on image-caption paired datasets. We first demonstrate that our approach yields significantly improved capabilities in ranking images by a certain attribute (e.g., elephants are larger than cats), which is useful in retrieval or constructing attribute-based classifiers, and improved zeroshot classification performance on many downstream image classification tasks. In addition, our approach enables a new mechanism for inference that we refer to as comparative prompting, where we leverage prior knowledge of text descriptions of differences between classes of interest, achieving even larger performance gains in classification. Finally, we illustrate that the resulting embeddings obey a larger degree of geometric properties in embedding space, such as in text-to-image generation.</p></details> | 30 pages |
| **[Helping CLIP See Both the Forest and the Trees: A Decomposition and Description Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03458v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP achieve cross-modal semantic alignment through contrastive learning, exhibiting robust zero-shot generalization. Traditional prompt engineering, however, predominantly relies on coarse-grained category labels, neglecting fine-grained local semantics. Existing approaches assume that VLMs inherently recognize localized visual details and attempt to enhance classification by augmenting text prompts with attribute descriptors generated by large language models. However, our systematic experiments reveal critical limitations: CLIP's strong bias toward global image patterns hinders its ability to process localized visual descriptors. To address this fundamental constraint, we propose a simple, effective, and plug-and-play solution that enables CLIP to ``See Both the Forest and the Trees." Specifically, we employ stochastic multi-crop augmentation to activate CLIP's latent capacity for localized feature analysis. By cropping only partial regions, the approach effectively constrains the model's receptive field and recalibrates its attention mechanism, thereby mitigating its inherent bias. We evaluate the proposed method under zero-shot, few-shot, and test-time adaptation settings, and extensive experiments demonstrate that D&D achieves promising performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlearning the Noisy Correspondence Makes CLIP More Robust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03434v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The data appetite for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has continuously scaled up from the early millions to billions today, which faces an untenable trade-off with data quality and inevitably introduces Noisy Correspondence (NC) samples. Undoubtedly, such semantically unrelated data significantly impairs the performance of VLMs. Previous efforts mainly address this challenge by estimating refined alignment for more precise guidance. However, such resource-intensive pipelines that train VLMs from scratch struggle to meet realistic data demands. In this paper, we present a brand new perspective that seeks to directly eliminate the harmful effects of NC in pre-trained VLMs. Specifically, we propose NCU, a Noisy Correspondence Unlearning fine-tuning framework that efficiently enhances VLMs' robustness by forgetting learned noisy knowledge. The key to NCU is learning the hardest negative information, which can provide explicit unlearning direction for both false positives and false negatives. Such twin goals unlearning process can be formalized into one unified optimal transport objective for fast fine-tuning. We validate our approach with the prevailing CLIP model over various downstream tasks. Remarkably, NCU surpasses the robust pre-trained method on zero-shot transfer while with lower computational overhead. The code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |
| **[From Long Videos to Engaging Clips: A Human-Inspired Video Editing Framework with Multimodal Narrative Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02790v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks: highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500 professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by their incapacity to reliably evaluate sample quality. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics, Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions and, for fidelity, the radii of nearest neighbor balls, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics exhibit linear score degradation as the proportion of poor samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability for evaluating generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Attention Heads Are What You Need: Refining CLIP's Image Representation with Attention Ablation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00537v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the role of attention heads in CLIP's image encoder. While CLIP has exhibited robust performance across diverse applications, we hypothesize that certain attention heads negatively affect final representations and that ablating them can improve performance in downstream tasks. To capitalize on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective method, called Attention Ablation Technique (AAT), to suppress the contribution of specific heads by manipulating attention weights. By integrating two alternative strategies tailored for different application scenarios, AAT systematically identifies and ablates detrimental attention heads to enhance representation quality. Experiments demonstrate that AAT consistently improves downstream task performance across various domains, boosting recall rate by up to 11.1% on CLIP-family models for cross-modal retrieval. The results highlight the potential of AAT to effectively refine large-scale vision-language models with virtually no increase in inference cost.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[MadCLIP: Few-shot Medical Anomaly Detection with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23810v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An innovative few-shot anomaly detection approach is presented, leveraging the pre-trained CLIP model for medical data, and adapting it for both image-level anomaly classification (AC) and pixel-level anomaly segmentation (AS). A dual-branch design is proposed to separately capture normal and abnormal features through learnable adapters in the CLIP vision encoder. To improve semantic alignment, learnable text prompts are employed to link visual features. Furthermore, SigLIP loss is applied to effectively handle the many-to-one relationship between images and unpaired text prompts, showcasing its adaptation in the medical field for the first time. Our approach is validated on multiple modalities, demonstrating superior performance over existing methods for AC and AS, in both same-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations. Unlike prior work, it does not rely on synthetic data or memory banks, and an ablation study confirms the contribution of each component.

| **[Unifying Biomedical Vision-Language Expertise: Towards a Generalist Foundation Model via Multi-CLIP Knowledge Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22567v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP models pretrained on natural images with billion-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in zero-shot classification, cross-modal retrieval, and open-ended visual answering. However, transferring this success to biomedicine is hindered by the scarcity of large-scale biomedical image-text corpora, the heterogeneity of image modalities, and fragmented data standards across institutions. These limitations hinder the development of a unified and generalizable biomedical foundation model trained from scratch. To overcome this, we introduce MMKD-CLIP, a generalist biomedical foundation model developed via Multiple Medical CLIP Knowledge Distillation. Rather than relying on billion-scale raw data, MMKD-CLIP distills knowledge from nine state-of-the-art domain-specific or generalist biomedical CLIP models, each pretrained on millions of biomedical image-text pairs. Our two-stage training pipeline first performs CLIP-style pretraining on over 2.9 million biomedical image-text pairs from 26 image modalities, followed by feature-level distillation using over 19.2 million feature pairs extracted from teacher models. We evaluate MMKD-CLIP on 58 diverse biomedical datasets, encompassing over 10.8 million biomedical images across nine image modalities. The evaluation spans six core task types: zero-shot classification, linear probing, cross-modal retrieval, visual question answering, survival prediction, and cancer diagnosis. MMKD-CLIP consistently outperforms all teacher models while demonstrating remarkable robustness and generalization across image domains and task settings. These results underscore that multi-teacher knowledge distillation is a scalable and effective paradigm for building high-performing biomedical foundation models under the practical constraints of real-world data availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Accurate Heart Rate Measurement from Ultra-Short Video Clips via Periodicity-Guided rPPG Estimation and Signal Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22078v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many remote Heart Rate (HR) measurement methods focus on estimating remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) signals from video clips lasting around 10 seconds but often overlook the need for HR estimation from ultra-short video clips. In this paper, we aim to accurately measure HR from ultra-short 2-second video clips by specifically addressing two key challenges. First, to overcome the limited number of heartbeat cycles in ultra-short video clips, we propose an effective periodicity-guided rPPG estimation method that enforces consistent periodicity between rPPG signals estimated from ultra-short clips and their much longer ground truth signals. Next, to mitigate estimation inaccuracies due to spectral leakage, we propose including a generator to reconstruct longer rPPG signals from ultra-short ones while preserving their periodic consistency to enable more accurate HR measurement. Extensive experiments on four rPPG estimation benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed method not only accurately measures HR from ultra-short video clips but also outperform previous rPPG estimation techniques to achieve state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

They are often preferred over rigid rule-based metrics, especially for complex reasoning tasks involving free-form outputs. In this paradigm, an LLM is typically prompted to compare a candidate answer against a ground-truth reference and assign a binary reward indicating correctness. Despite the seeming simplicity of this comparison task, we find that generative reward models exhibit surprising vulnerabilities to superficial manipulations: non-word symbols (e.g., ":" or ".") or reasoning openers like "Thought process:" and "Let's solve this problem step by step." can often lead to false positive rewards. We demonstrate that this weakness is widespread across LLMs, datasets, and prompt formats, posing a serious threat for core algorithmic paradigms that rely on generative reward models, such as rejection sampling, preference optimization, and RLVR. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a simple yet effective data augmentation strategy and train a new generative reward model with substantially improved robustness. Our findings highlight the urgent need for more reliable LLM-based evaluation methods. We release our robust, general-domain reward model and its synthetic training data at https://huggingface.co/sarosavo/Master-RM and https://huggingface.co/datasets/sarosavo/Master-RM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimistic Exploration for Risk-Averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08793v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Risk-averse Constrained Reinforcement Learning (RaCRL) aims to learn policies that minimise the likelihood of rare and catastrophic constraint violations caused by an environment's inherent randomness. In general, risk-aversion leads to conservative exploration of the environment which typically results in converging to sub-optimal policies that fail to adequately maximise reward or, in some cases, fail to achieve the goal. In this paper, we propose an exploration-based approach for RaCRL called Optimistic Risk-averse Actor Critic (ORAC), which constructs an exploratory policy by maximising a local upper confidence bound of the state-action reward value function whilst minimising a local lower confidence bound of the risk-averse state-action cost value function. Specifically, at each step, the weighting assigned to the cost value is increased or decreased if it exceeds or falls below the safety constraint value. This way the policy is encouraged to explore uncertain regions of the environment to discover high reward states whilst still satisfying the safety constraints. Our experimental results demonstrate that the ORAC approach prevents convergence to sub-optimal policies and improves significantly the reward-cost trade-off in various continuous control tasks such as Safety-Gymnasium and a complex building energy management environment CityLearn.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-aided Bigraph Matching Approach to Multi-Crew Restoration of Damaged Power Networks Coupled with Road Transportation Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19703v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The resilience of critical infrastructure networks (CINs) after disruptions, such as those caused by natural hazards, depends on both the speed of restoration and the extent to which operational functionality can be regained. Allocating resources for restoration is a combinatorial optimal planning problem that involves determining which crews will repair specific network nodes and in what order. This paper presents a novel graph-based formulation that merges two interconnected graphs, representing crew and transportation nodes and power grid nodes, into a single heterogeneous graph. To enable efficient planning, graph reinforcement learning (GRL) is integrated with bigraph matching. GRL is utilized to design the incentive function for assigning crews to repair tasks based on the graph-abstracted state of the environment, ensuring generalization across damage scenarios. Two learning techniques are employed: a graph neural network trained using Proximal Policy Optimization and another trained via Neuroevolution. The learned incentive functions inform a bipartite graph that links crews to repair tasks, enabling weighted maximum matching for crew-to-task allocations. An efficient simulation environment that pre-computes optimal node-to-node path plans is used to train the proposed restoration planning methods. An IEEE 8500-bus power distribution test network coupled with a 21 square km transportation network is used as the case study, with scenarios varying in terms of numbers of damaged nodes, depots, and crews. Results demonstrate the approach's generalizability and scalability across scenarios, with learned policies providing 3-fold better performance than random policies, while also outperforming optimization-based solutions in both computation time (by several orders of magnitude) and power restored.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation in proceedings of ASME IDETC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Penalizing Infeasible Actions and Reward Scaling in Reinforcement Learning with Offline Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08761v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with offline data suffers from Q-value extrapolation errors. To address this issue, we first demonstrate that linear extrapolation of the Q-function beyond the data range is particularly problematic. To mitigate this, we propose guiding the gradual decrease of Q-values outside the data range, which is achieved through reward scaling with layer normalization (RS-LN) and a penalization mechanism for infeasible actions (PA). By combining RS-LN and PA, we develop a new algorithm called PARS. We evaluate PARS across a range of tasks, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms in both offline training and online fine-tuning on the D4RL benchmark, with notable success in the challenging AntMaze Ultra task.</p></details> | Accepted to ICML2025 |

We present a framework automating algorithm discovery by conceptualizing them as sequences of operations, represented as tokens. These computational tokens are chained using a grammar, enabling the formation of increasingly sophisticated procedures. Our ensemble Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) guided by reinforcement learning (RL) explores token chaining and drives the creation of new tokens. This methodology rediscovers, improves, and generates new algorithms that substantially outperform existing methods for strongly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems and foundational quantum computing approaches such as Grover's and Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. Operating at the computational rather than code-generation level, our framework produces algorithms that can be tailored specifically to problem instances, not merely classes.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[On the Effect of Regularization in Policy Mirror Descent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08718v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) has emerged as a unifying framework in reinforcement learning (RL) by linking policy gradient methods with a first-order optimization method known as mirror descent. At its core, PMD incorporates two key regularization components: (i) a distance term that enforces a trust region for stable policy updates and (ii) an MDP regularizer that augments the reward function to promote structure and robustness. While PMD has been extensively studied in theory, empirical investigations remain scarce. This work provides a large-scale empirical analysis of the interplay between these two regularization techniques, running over 500k training seeds on small RL environments. Our results demonstrate that, although the two regularizers can partially substitute each other, their precise combination is critical for achieving robust performance. These findings highlight the potential for advancing research on more robust algorithms in RL, particularly with respect to hyperparameter sensitivity.</p></details> | Accepted at RLC |

Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08707v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) presents a powerful paradigm for learning complex robotic tasks from human demonstrations. However, most approaches make the assumption that expert demonstrations are available, which is often not the case. Those that allow for suboptimality in the demonstrations are not designed for long-horizon goals or adversarial tasks. Many desirable robot capabilities fall into one or both of these categories, thus highlighting a critical shortcoming in the ability of IRL to produce field-ready robotic agents. We introduce Sample-efficient Preference-based inverse reinforcement learning for Long-horizon Adversarial tasks from Suboptimal Hierarchical demonstrations (SPLASH), which advances the state-of-the-art in learning from suboptimal demonstrations to long-horizon and adversarial settings. We empirically validate SPLASH on a maritime capture-the-flag task in simulation, and demonstrate real-world applicability with sim-to-real translation experiments on autonomous unmanned surface vehicles. We show that our proposed methods allow SPLASH to significantly outperform the state-of-the-art in reward learning from suboptimal demonstrations.</p></details> |  |

Empirical results indicate that these instructions \textit{can} improve a reinforcement learning agent's performance.

| **[Multi-critic Learning for Whole-body End-effector Twist Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08656v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning whole-body control for locomotion and arm motions in a single policy has challenges, as the two tasks have conflicting goals. For instance, efficient locomotion typically favors a horizontal base orientation, while end-effector tracking may benefit from base tilting to extend reachability. Additionally, current Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches using a pose-based task specification lack the ability to directly control the end-effector velocity, making smoothly executing trajectories very challenging. To address these limitations, we propose an RL-based framework that allows for dynamic, velocity-aware whole-body end-effector control. Our method introduces a multi-critic actor architecture that decouples the reward signals for locomotion and manipulation, simplifying reward tuning and allowing the policy to resolve task conflicts more effectively. Furthermore, we design a twist-based end-effector task formulation that can track both discrete poses and motion trajectories. We validate our approach through a set of simulation and hardware experiments using a quadruped robot equipped with a robotic arm. The resulting controller can simultaneously walk and move its end-effector and shows emergent whole-body behaviors, where the base assists the arm in extending the workspace, despite a lack of explicit formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Deep Reinforcement Learning for Resource Allocation with Peak Age of Information Violation Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08653v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs), control and communication systems must be co-designed due to their strong interdependence. This paper presents a novel optimization theory-based safe deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for ultra-reliable WNCSs, ensuring constraint satisfaction while optimizing performance, for the first time in the literature. The approach minimizes power consumption under key constraints, including Peak Age of Information (PAoI) violation probability, transmit power, and schedulability in the finite blocklength regime. PAoI violation probability is uniquely derived by combining stochastic maximum allowable transfer interval (MATI) and maximum allowable packet delay (MAD) constraints in a multi-sensor network. The framework consists of two stages: optimization theory and safe DRL. The first stage derives optimality conditions to establish mathematical relationships among variables, simplifying and decomposing the problem. The second stage employs a safe DRL model where a teacher-student framework guides the DRL agent (student). The control mechanism (teacher) evaluates compliance with system constraints and suggests the nearest feasible action when needed. Extensive simulations show that the proposed framework outperforms rule-based and other optimization theory based DRL benchmarks, achieving faster convergence, higher rewards, and greater stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages, to be published in IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> |

Following our previous work Leanabell-Prover-V1, we continual to choose to posttrain existing strong prover models for further performance improvement. In our V2 version, we mainly upgrade the Reinforcement Learning (RL) with feedback provided by the Lean 4 verifier. Crucially, verifier feedback, such as indicating success or detailing specific errors, allows the LLM to become ``self-aware'' of the correctness of its own reasoning process and learn to reflexively correct errors. Leanabell-Prover-V2 directly optimizes LLM reasoning trajectories with multi-turn verifier interactions, together with feedback token masking for stable RL training and a simple reward strategy. Experiments show that Leanabell-Prover-V2 improves performance by 3.2% (pass@128) with Kimina-Prover-Preview-Distill-7B and 2.0% (pass@128) with DeepSeek-Prover-V2-7B on the MiniF2F test set.

Since all existing labelled datasets are already used for training the large Vision Language Models (VLMs), it becomes challenging to improve the performance of the same. Considering this, it is essential to consider the unsupervised image captioning performance, which remains relatively under-explored. To that end, we propose LoGIC (Lewis Communication Game for Image Captioning), a Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning game. The proposed method consists of two agents, a 'speaker' and a 'listener', with the objective of learning a strategy for communicating in natural language. We train agents in the cooperative common-reward setting using the GRPO algorithm and show that improvement in image captioning performance emerges as a consequence of the agents learning to play the game. We show that using pre-trained VLMs as the 'speaker' and Large Language Model (LLM) for language understanding in the 'listener', we achieved a $46$ BLEU score after fine-tuning using LoGIC without additional labels, a $2$ units advantage in absolute metrics compared to the $44$ BLEU score of the vanilla VLM. Additionally, we replace the VLM from the 'speaker' with lightweight components: (i) a ViT for image perception and (ii) a GPT2 language generation, and train them from scratch using LoGIC, obtaining a $31$ BLEU score in the unsupervised setting, a $10$ points advantage over existing unsupervised image-captioning methods.</p></details> |  |

The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank, enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions, and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recursive Reward Aggregation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08537v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In reinforcement learning (RL), aligning agent behavior with specific objectives typically requires careful design of the reward function, which can be challenging when the desired objectives are complex. In this work, we propose an alternative approach for flexible behavior alignment that eliminates the need to modify the reward function by selecting appropriate reward aggregation functions. By introducing an algebraic perspective on Markov decision processes (MDPs), we show that the Bellman equations naturally emerge from the recursive generation and aggregation of rewards, allowing for the generalization of the standard discounted sum to other recursive aggregations, such as discounted max and Sharpe ratio. Our approach applies to both deterministic and stochastic settings and integrates seamlessly with value-based and actor-critic algorithms. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively optimizes diverse objectives, highlighting its versatility and potential for real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Reinf...</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025</p></details> |

Existing methods often rely on aligning visible body parts, applying occlusion augmentation, or complementing missing semantics using holistic images. However, they face challenges in handling diverse occlusion scenarios not seen during training and the issue of feature contamination from holistic images. To address these limitations, we propose Occlusion-Guided Feature Purification Learning via Reinforced Knowledge Distillation (OGFR), which simultaneously mitigates these challenges. OGFR adopts a teacher-student distillation architecture that effectively incorporates diverse occlusion patterns into feature representation while transferring the purified discriminative holistic knowledge from the holistic to the occluded branch through reinforced knowledge distillation. Specifically, an Occlusion-Aware Vision Transformer is designed to leverage learnable occlusion pattern embeddings to explicitly model such diverse occlusion types, thereby guiding occlusion-aware robust feature representation. Moreover, we devise a Feature Erasing and Purification Module within the holistic branch, in which an agent is employed to identify low-quality patch tokens of holistic images that contain noisy negative information via deep reinforcement learning, and substitute these patch tokens with learnable embedding tokens to avoid feature contamination and further excavate identity-related discriminative clues. Afterward, with the assistance of knowledge distillation, the student branch effectively absorbs the purified holistic knowledge to precisely learn robust representation regardless of the interference of occlusions.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Squeeze the Soaked Sponge: Efficient Off-policy Reinforcement Finetuning for Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06892v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated its potential to improve the reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). One major limitation of most existing Reinforcement Finetuning (RFT) methods is that they are on-policy RL in nature, i.e., data generated during the past learning process is not fully utilized. This inevitably comes at a significant cost of compute and time, posing a stringent bottleneck on continuing economic and efficient scaling. To this end, we launch the renaissance of off-policy RL and propose Reincarnating Mix-policy Proximal Policy Gradient (ReMix), a general approach to enable on-policy RFT methods like PPO and GRPO to leverage off-policy data. ReMix consists of three major components: (1) Mix-policy proximal policy gradient with an increased Update-To-Data (UTD) ratio for efficient training; (2) KL-Convex policy constraint to balance the trade-off between stability and flexibility; (3) Policy reincarnation to achieve a seamless transition from efficient early-stage learning to steady asymptotic improvement. In our experiments, we train a series of ReMix models upon PPO, GRPO and 1.5B, 7B base models. ReMix shows an average Pass@1 accuracy of 52.10% (for 1.5B model) with 0.079M response rollouts, 350 training steps and achieves 63.27%/64.39% (for 7B model) with 0.007M/0.011M response rollouts, 50/75 training steps, on five math reasoning benchmarks (i.e., AIME'24, AMC'23, Minerva, OlympiadBench, and MATH500). Compared with 15 recent advanced models, ReMix shows SOTA-level performance with an over 30x to 450x reduction in training cost in terms of rollout data volume. In addition, we reveal insightful findings via multifaceted analysis, including the implicit preference for shorter responses due to the Whipping Effect of off-policy discrepancy, the collapse mode of self-reflection behavior under the presence of severe off-policyness, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version, v3, added the missing name of x-axis in the left part of Fig.1 and corrected a wrong number in Fig.3.

RL learns a driving policy through trial and error in traffic scenarios, guided by a reward function that combines the driving objectives. The design of such reward function has received insufficient attention, yielding ill-defined rewards with various pitfalls. Safety, in particular, has long been regarded only as a penalty for collisions. This leaves the risks associated with actions leading up to a collision unaddressed, limiting the applicability of RL in real-world scenarios. To address these shortcomings, our work focuses on enhancing the reward formulation by defining a set of driving objectives and structuring them hierarchically. Furthermore, we discuss the formulation of these objectives in a normalized manner to transparently determine their contribution to the overall reward. Additionally, we introduce a novel risk-aware objective for various driving interactions based on a two-dimensional ellipsoid function and an extension of Responsibility-Sensitive Safety (RSS) concepts. We evaluate the efficacy of our proposed reward in unsignalized intersection scenarios with varying traffic densities. The approach decreases collision rates by 21\% on average compared to baseline rewards and consistently surpasses them in route progress and cumulative reward, demonstrating its capability to promote safer driving behaviors while maintaining high-performance levels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Curriculum Learning for Driving Scenarios: Towards Robust and Efficient Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08264v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a ``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization, achieving higher success rates: +9% in low traffic density, +21% in high traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of RL-based autonomous driving agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV 2025)</p></details> |

However, the limited energy capacity of UAVs remains a significant challenge. In this case, laser beam directors (LBDs) have emerged as an effective technology for wireless charging of UAVs during operation, thereby enabling sustained data collection without frequent returns to charging stations (CSs). In this work, we investigate the age of information (AoI) optimization in LBD-powered UAV-assisted IoT networks, where multiple UAVs collect data from distributed IoTs while being recharged by laser beams. We formulate a joint optimization problem that aims to minimize the peak AoI while determining optimal UAV trajectories and laser charging strategies. This problem is particularly challenging due to its non-convex nature, complex temporal dependencies, and the need to balance data collection efficiency with energy consumption constraints. To address these challenges, we propose a novel multi-agent proximal policy optimization with temporal memory and multi-agent coordination (MAPPO-TM) framework. Specifically, MAPPO-TM incorporates temporal memory mechanisms to capture the dynamic nature of UAV operations and facilitates effective coordination among multiple UAVs through decentralized learning while considering global system objectives. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MAPPO-TM algorithm outperforms conventional approaches in terms of peak AoI minimization and energy efficiency. Ideally, the proposed algorithm achieves up to 15.1% reduction in peak AoI compared to conventional multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) methods.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |
| **[GTR: Guided Thought Reinforcement Prevents Thought Collapse in RL-based VLM Agent Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08525v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable outcome rewards (RLVR) has effectively scaled up chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). Yet, its efficacy in training vision-language model (VLM) agents for goal-directed action reasoning in visual environments is less established. This work investigates this problem through extensive experiments on complex card games, such as 24 points, and embodied tasks from ALFWorld. We find that when rewards are based solely on action outcomes, RL fails to incentivize CoT reasoning in VLMs, instead leading to a phenomenon we termed thought collapse, characterized by a rapid loss of diversity in the agent's thoughts, state-irrelevant and incomplete reasoning, and subsequent invalid actions, resulting in negative rewards. To counteract thought collapse, we highlight the necessity of process guidance and propose an automated corrector that evaluates and refines the agent's reasoning at each RL step. This simple and scalable GTR (Guided Thought Reinforcement) framework trains reasoning and action simultaneously without the need for dense, per-step human labeling. Our experiments demonstrate that GTR significantly enhances the performance and generalization of the LLaVA-7b model across various visual environments, achieving 3-5 times higher task success rates compared to SoTA models with notably smaller model sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, recent studies reveal that offline pre-trained agents often underperform during online fine-tuning due to inaccurate value estimation caused by distribution shift, with random initialization proving more effective in certain cases. In this work, we propose a novel method, Online Pre-Training for Offline-to-Online RL (OPT), explicitly designed to address the issue of inaccurate value estimation in offline pre-trained agents. OPT introduces a new learning phase, Online Pre-Training, which allows the training of a new value function tailored specifically for effective online fine-tuning. Implementation of OPT on TD3 and SPOT demonstrates an average 30% improvement in performance across a wide range of D4RL environments, including MuJoCo, Antmaze, and Adroit.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |

Reaction wheels (RWs) play a pivotal role in attitude control, and maintaining control resilience during RW faults is critical to preserving mission objectives and system stability. However, traditional Proportional Derivative (PD) controllers and existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms such as TD3, PPO, and A2C often fall short in providing the real time adaptability and fault tolerance required for autonomous satellite operations. This study introduces a DRL-based control strategy designed to improve satellite resilience and adaptability under fault conditions. Specifically, the proposed method integrates Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) with Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) and Dimension Wise Clipping (DWC) referred to as TD3-HD to enhance learning in sparse reward environments and maintain satellite stability during RW failures. The proposed approach is benchmarked against PD control and leading DRL algorithms. Experimental results show that TD3-HD achieves significantly lower attitude error, improved angular velocity regulation, and enhanced stability under fault conditions. These findings underscore the proposed method potential as a powerful, fault tolerant, onboard AI solution for autonomous satellite attitude control.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the widespread use of switchback experiments in A/B testing, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis of various switchback designs in Markovian environments. Unlike many existing works which derive the optimal design based on specific and relatively simple estimators, our analysis covers a range of state-of-the-art estimators developed in the reinforcement learning (RL) literature. It reveals that the effectiveness of different switchback designs depends crucially on (i) the size of the carryover effect and (ii) the auto-correlations among reward errors over time. Meanwhile, these findings are estimator-agnostic, i.e., they apply to most RL estimators. Based on these insights, we provide a workflow to offer guidelines for practitioners on designing switchback experiments in A/B testing.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical gap persists: these models struggle with dynamic spatial interactions, a capability essential for real-world applications. To bridge this gap, we introduce M2-Reasoning-7B, a model designed to excel in both general and spatial reasoning. Our approach integrates two key innovations: (1) a novel data pipeline that generates 294.2K high-quality data samples (168K for cold-start fine-tuning and 126.2K for RLVR), which feature logically coherent reasoning trajectories and have undergone comprehensive assessment; and (2) a dynamic multi-task training strategy with step-wise optimization to mitigate conflicts between data, and task-specific rewards for delivering tailored incentive signals. This combination of curated data and advanced training allows M2-Reasoning-7B to set a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) across 8 benchmarks, showcasing superior performance in both general and spatial reasoning domains.</p></details> | 31pages, 14 figures |

However, reinforcement learning-based motion policies often suffer from robustness degradation due to the sim-to-real dynamics gap, thereby affecting the agility of real robots. In this work, we propose a novel robust adversarial training paradigm designed to enhance the robustness of humanoid motion policies in real worlds. The paradigm introduces a learnable adversarial attack network that precisely identifies vulnerabilities in motion policies and applies targeted perturbations, forcing the motion policy to enhance its robustness against perturbations through dynamic adversarial training. We conduct experiments on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot for both perceptive locomotion and whole-body control tasks. The results demonstrate that our proposed method significantly enhances the robot's motion robustness in real world environments, enabling successful traversal of challenging terrains and highly agile whole-body trajectory tracking.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

Specifically, first, we construct the dual-regime dataset based on a novel tagging pipeline and a multi-agent synthesis strategy, and then we apply Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)-enhanced knowledge distillation, enabling efficient and fine-grained reasoning transfer with minimal pretraining cost. Besides, we implement a cold-start initialization strategy that introduces mode-selection priors using majority-vote signals and intent-aware prompting. Finally, we propose Step-SRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that incorporates intermediate supervision into the GRPO framework, offering structured guidance over both reasoning-mode selection and response accuracy. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that KAT consistently matches or even outperforms current state-of-the-art models, including DeepSeek-R1-0528 and Qwen3-235B-A22B, across a wide range of reasoning-intensive tasks while reducing token usage by up to approximately 30\%. Beyond academic evaluation, KAT has been successfully deployed in Kwaipilot (i.e., Kuaishou's internal coding assistant), and improves real-world development workflows with high accuracy, efficiency, and controllable reasoning behaviors. Moreover, we are actively training a 200B Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with 40B activation parameters, where the early-stage results already demonstrate promising improvements in performance and efficiency, further showing the scalability of the AutoThink paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributional Soft Actor-Critic with Diffusion Policy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01381v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning has been proven to be highly effective in handling complex control tasks. Traditional methods typically use unimodal distributions, such as Gaussian distributions, to model the output of value distributions. However, unimodal distribution often and easily causes bias in value function estimation, leading to poor algorithm performance. This paper proposes a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm called DSAC-D (Distributed Soft Actor Critic with Diffusion Policy) to address the challenges of estimating bias in value functions and obtaining multimodal policy representations. A multimodal distributional policy iteration framework that can converge to the optimal policy was established by introducing policy entropy and value distribution function. A diffusion value network that can accurately characterize the distribution of multi peaks was constructed by generating a set of reward samples through reverse sampling using a diffusion model. Based on this, a distributional reinforcement learning algorithm with dual diffusion of the value network and the policy network was derived. MuJoCo testing tasks demonstrate that the proposed algorithm not only learns multimodal policy, but also achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in all 9 control tasks, with significant suppression of estimation bias and total average return improvement of over 10% compared to existing mainstream algorithms. The results of real vehicle testing show that DSAC-D can accurately characterize the multimodal distribution of different driving styles, and the diffusion policy network can characterize multimodal trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted IEEE ITSC 2025</p></details> |

This is accomplished through high-fidelity synthetic data generation and adversarial training. The synthetic data generation process begins with human-curated seed data, which undergoes query augmentation and paraphrasing to create diverse and contextually rich examples. This augmented data is then subjected to multiple rounds of curation, ensuring high fidelity and relevance. Inspired by recent advances in the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture, our adversarial training employs reinforcement learning to guide a generator that produces challenging synthetic examples. These examples are used to fine-tune the safety classifier, enhancing its ability to detect and mitigate harmful content. Additionally, we incorporate strategies from recent research on efficient LLM training, leveraging the capabilities of smaller models to improve the performance of larger generative models. With iterative adversarial training and the generation of diverse, high-quality synthetic data, our framework enables small language models (SLMs) to serve as robust safety guardrails. This approach not only reduces computational overhead but also enhances resilience against adversarial attacks, offering a scalable and efficient solution for content moderation in AI systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent Safety Alignment via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08270v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of autonomous Large Language Model (LLM) agents capable of tool usage has introduced new safety risks that go beyond traditional conversational misuse. These agents, empowered to execute external functions, are vulnerable to both user-initiated threats (e.g., adversarial prompts) and tool-initiated threats (e.g., malicious outputs from compromised tools). In this paper, we propose the first unified safety-alignment framework for tool-using agents, enabling models to handle both channels of threat via structured reasoning and sandboxed reinforcement learning. We introduce a tri-modal taxonomy, including benign, malicious, and sensitive for both user prompts and tool responses, and define a policy-driven decision model. Our framework employs a custom-designed sandbox environment that simulates real-world tool execution and allows fine-grained reward shaping. Through extensive evaluations on public and self-built benchmarks, including Agent SafetyBench, InjecAgent, and BFCL, we demonstrate that our safety-aligned agents significantly improve resistance to security threats while preserving strong utility on benign tasks. Our results show that safety and effectiveness can be jointly optimized, laying the groundwork for trustworthy deployment of autonomous LLM agents.</p></details> |  |

While Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are the dominant training paradigms, a systematic methodology for combining them to maximize both accuracy and efficiency remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a practical and effective training recipe that strategically integrates extended SFT with RL from online inference (GRPO). We posit that these methods play complementary, not competing, roles: a prolonged SFT phase first pushes the model's accuracy to its limits, after which a GRPO phase dramatically improves token efficiency while preserving this peak performance. Our experiments reveal that extending SFT for as many as 10 epochs is crucial for performance breakthroughs, and that the primary role of GRPO in this framework is to optimize solution length. The efficacy of our recipe is rigorously validated through top-tier performance on challenging benchmarks, including a high rank among over 2,200 teams in the strictly leak-free AI Mathematical Olympiad (AIMO). This work provides the community with a battle-tested blueprint for developing state-of-the-art mathematical reasoners that are both exceptionally accurate and practically efficient.

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Through flexible synthetic modality training, F3-Net maintains robust performance even in the presence of missing MRI sequences, leveraging a zero-image strategy to substitute absent modalities without relying on explicit synthesis networks, thereby enhancing real-world applicability. Its unified architecture supports multi-pathology segmentation across glioma, metastasis, stroke, and white matter lesions without retraining, outperforming CNN-based and transformer-based models that typically require disease-specific fine-tuning. Evaluated on diverse datasets such as BraTS 2021, BraTS 2024, and ISLES 2022, F3-Net demonstrates strong resilience to domain shifts and clinical heterogeneity. On the whole pathology dataset, F3-Net achieves average Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs) of 0.94 for BraTS-GLI 2024, 0.82 for BraTS-MET 2024, 0.94 for BraTS 2021, and 0.79 for ISLES 2022. This positions it as a versatile, scalable solution bridging the gap between deep learning research and practical clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |

Such miscalibration, challenges their clinical translation. We propose to use marginal L1 average calibration error (mL1-ACE) as a novel auxiliary loss function to improve pixel-wise calibration without compromising segmentation quality. We show that this loss, despite using hard binning, is directly differentiable, bypassing the need for approximate but differentiable surrogate or soft binning approaches. Our work also introduces the concept of dataset reliability histograms which generalises standard reliability diagrams for refined visual assessment of calibration in semantic segmentation aggregated at the dataset level. Using mL1-ACE, we reduce average and maximum calibration error by 45% and 55% respectively, maintaining a Dice score of 87% on the BraTS 2021 dataset.

In this work, we propose differentiable formulations of marginal L1 Average Calibration Error (mL1-ACE) as an auxiliary loss that can be computed on a per-image basis. We compare both hard- and soft-binning approaches to directly improve pixel-wise calibration. Our experiments on four datasets (ACDC, AMOS, KiTS, BraTS) demonstrate that incorporating mL1-ACE significantly reduces calibration errors, particularly Average Calibration Error (ACE) and Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), while largely maintaining high Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSCs). We find that the soft-binned variant yields the greatest improvements in calibration, over the Dice plus cross-entropy loss baseline, but often compromises segmentation performance, with hard-binned mL1-ACE maintaining segmentation performance, albeit with weaker calibration improvement. To gain further insight into calibration performance and its variability across an imaging dataset, we introduce dataset reliability histograms, an aggregation of per-image reliability diagrams. The resulting analysis highlights improved alignment between predicted confidences and true accuracies. Overall, our approach not only enhances the trustworthiness of segmentation predictions but also shows potential for safer integration of deep learning methods into clinical workflows.

| **[Cycle Context Verification for In-Context Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08357v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) is emerging as a promising technique for achieving universal medical image segmentation, where a variety of objects of interest across imaging modalities can be segmented using a single model. Nevertheless, its performance is highly sensitive to the alignment between the query image and in-context image-mask pairs. In a clinical scenario, the scarcity of annotated medical images makes it challenging to select optimal in-context pairs, and fine-tuning foundation ICL models on contextual data is infeasible due to computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address this challenge, we propose Cycle Context Verification (CCV), a novel framework that enhances ICL-based medical image segmentation by enabling self-verification of predictions and accordingly enhancing contextual alignment. Specifically, CCV employs a cyclic pipeline in which the model initially generates a segmentation mask for the query image. Subsequently, the roles of the query and an in-context pair are swapped, allowing the model to validate its prediction by predicting the mask of the original in-context image. The accuracy of this secondary prediction serves as an implicit measure of the initial query segmentation. A query-specific prompt is introduced to alter the query image and updated to improve the measure, thereby enhancing the alignment between the query and in-context pairs. We evaluated CCV on seven medical image segmentation datasets using two ICL foundation models, demonstrating its superiority over existing methods. Our results highlight CCV's ability to enhance ICL-based segmentation, making it a robust solution for universal medical image segmentation. The code will be available at https://github.com/ShishuaiHu/CCV.</p></details> | MICCAI 2025 |
| **[Admissibility of Stein Shrinkage for Batch Normalization in the Presence of Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08261v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Batch normalization (BN) is a ubiquitous operation in deep neural networks used primarily to achieve stability and regularization during network training. BN involves feature map centering and scaling using sample means and variances, respectively. Since these statistics are being estimated across the feature maps within a batch, this problem is ideally suited for the application of Stein's shrinkage estimation, which leads to a better, in the mean-squared-error sense, estimate of the mean and variance of the batch. In this paper, we prove that the Stein shrinkage estimator for the mean and variance dominates over the sample mean and variance estimators in the presence of adversarial attacks when modeling these attacks using sub-Gaussian distributions. This facilitates and justifies the application of Stein shrinkage to estimate the mean and variance parameters in BN and use it in image classification (segmentation) tasks with and without adversarial attacks. We present SOTA performance results using this Stein corrected batch norm in a standard ResNet architecture applied to the task of image classification using CIFAR-10 data, 3D CNN on PPMI (neuroimaging) data and image segmentation using HRNet on Cityscape data with and without adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HNOSeg-XS: Extremely Small Hartley Neural Operator for Efficient and Resolution-Robust 3D Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08205v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical image segmentation, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformers are dominant. For CNNs, given the local receptive fields of convolutional layers, long-range spatial correlations are captured through consecutive convolutions and pooling. However, as the computational cost and memory footprint can be prohibitively large, 3D models can only afford fewer layers than 2D models with reduced receptive fields and abstract levels. For transformers, although long-range correlations can be captured by multi-head attention, its quadratic complexity with respect to input size is computationally demanding. Therefore, either model may require input size reduction to allow more filters and layers for better segmentation. Nevertheless, given their discrete nature, models trained with patch-wise training or image downsampling may produce suboptimal results when applied on higher resolutions. To address this issue, here we propose the resolution-robust HNOSeg-XS architecture. We model image segmentation by learnable partial differential equations through the Fourier neural operator which has the zero-shot super-resolution property. By replacing the Fourier transform by the Hartley transform and reformulating the problem in the frequency domain, we created the HNOSeg-XS model, which is resolution robust, fast, memory efficient, and extremely parameter efficient. When tested on the BraTS'23, KiTS'23, and MVSeg'23 datasets with a Tesla V100 GPU, HNOSeg-XS showed its superior resolution robustness with fewer than 34.7k model parameters. It also achieved the overall best inference time (< 0.24 s) and memory efficiency (< 1.8 GiB) compared to the tested CNN and transformer models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by IEEE TMI 2025</p></details> |

To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers, which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals, current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study, however, identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these, we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this, we propose SimCIS, a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment, ensuring "perfect alignment" to preserve objectness, while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories, we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative "visual query"-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks, settings, splits, and input data orders. All models and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/SooLab/SimCIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted by CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Prototype learning methods in MIS focus on generating segmentation masks through pixel-to-prototype comparison. However, current approaches often overlook sample diversity by using a fixed prototype per semantic class and neglect intra-class variation within each input. In this paper, we propose to generate instance-adaptive prototypes for MIS, which integrates a common prototype proposal (CPP) capturing common visual patterns and an instance-specific prototype proposal (IPP) tailored to each input. To further account for the intra-class variation, we propose to guide the IPP generation by re-weighting the intermediate feature map according to their confidence scores. These confidence scores are hierarchically generated using a transformer decoder. Additionally we introduce a novel self-supervised filtering strategy to prioritize the foreground pixels during the training of the transformer decoder. Extensive experiments demonstrate favorable performance of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Here, we propose a novel Weighted Propagation Convolution Neural Network based on U-Net (WPU-Net) to detect boundary in poly-crystalline microscopic images.

And we customize adaptive boundary weight for each pixel in each grain, so that it leads the network to preserve grain's geometric and topological characteristics. Moreover, we provide our dataset with the goal of advancing the development of image processing in materials science.

In boundary detection task, it reduces the error rate by 7\%, which outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Judging from Support-set: A New Way to Utilize Few-Shot Segmentation for Segmentation Refinement Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04519v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segmentation refinement aims to enhance the initial coarse masks generated by segmentation algorithms. The refined masks are expected to capture more details and better contours of the target objects. Research on segmentation refinement has developed as a response to the need for high-quality image segmentations. However, to our knowledge, no method has been developed that can determine the success of segmentation refinement. Such a method could ensure the reliability of segmentation in applications where the outcome of the segmentation is important and fosters innovation in image processing technologies. To address this research gap, we propose Judging From Support-set (JFS), a method to judge the success of segmentation refinement leveraging an off-the-shelf few-shot segmentation (FSS) model. The traditional goal of the problem in FSS is to find a target object in a query image utilizing target information given by a support set. However, we propose a novel application of the FSS model in our evaluation pipeline for segmentation refinement methods. Given a coarse mask as input, segmentation refinement methods produce a refined mask; these two masks become new support masks for the FSS model. The existing support mask then serves as the test set for the FSS model to evaluate the quality of the refined segmentation by the segmentation refinement methods. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed JFS framework by evaluating the SAM Enhanced Pseudo-Labels (SEPL) using SegGPT as the choice of FSS model on the PASCAL dataset. The results showed that JFS has the potential to determine whether the segmentation refinement process is successful.</p></details> | ICIP 2025 |

| **[Omni-Fusion of Spatial and Spectral for Hyperspectral Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06606v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Hyperspectral Imaging (MHSI) has emerged as a promising tool for enhanced disease diagnosis, particularly in computational pathology, offering rich spectral information that aids in identifying subtle biochemical properties of tissues. Despite these advantages, effectively fusing both spatial-dimensional and spectral-dimensional information from MHSIs remains challenging due to its high dimensionality and spectral redundancy inherent characteristics. To solve the above challenges, we propose a novel spatial-spectral omni-fusion network for hyperspectral image segmentation, named as Omni-Fuse. Here, we introduce abundant cross-dimensional feature fusion operations, including a cross-dimensional enhancement module that refines both spatial and spectral features through bidirectional attention mechanisms, a spectral-guided spatial query selection to select the most spectral-related spatial feature as the query, and a two-stage cross-dimensional decoder which dynamically guide the model to focus on the selected spatial query. Despite of numerous attention blocks, Omni-Fuse remains efficient in execution. Experiments on two microscopic hyperspectral image datasets show that our approach can significantly improve the segmentation performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods, with over 5.73 percent improvement in DSC.

Our approach integrates Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) and Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) techniques into the traditional VM U-Net framework, significantly improving segmentation accuracy, feature localization, and computational efficiency. Both models show superior performance compared to the baseline VM-Unet across multiple datasets. Notably, VMSEUnet achieves the highest accuracy, IoU, precision, and recall while maintaining low loss values. It also exhibits exceptional computational efficiency with faster inference times and lower memory usage on both GPU and CPU. Overall, the study suggests that the enhanced architecture VMSE-Unet is a valuable tool for medical image analysis.

X-ray image segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems, yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image. To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.</p></details> | 4 pages |

However, challenges remain, including efficient 3D medical image processing across diverse modalities and handling data variability. In this work, we introduce Hierarchical Soft Mixture-of-Experts (HoME), a two-level token-routing layer for efficient long-context modeling, specifically designed for 3D medical image segmentation. Built on the Mamba state-space model (SSM) backbone, HoME enhances sequential modeling through sparse, adaptive expert routing. The first stage employs a Soft Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) layer to partition input sequences into local groups, routing tokens to specialized per-group experts for localized feature extraction. The second stage aggregates these outputs via a global SMoE layer, enabling cross-group information fusion and global context refinement. This hierarchical design, combining local expert routing with global expert refinement improves generalizability and segmentation performance, surpassing state-of-the-art results across datasets from the three most commonly used 3D medical imaging modalities and data quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoPT: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Segmentation using Domain-Agnostic Text Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07125v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) involves learning class semantics from labeled data within a source domain that generalize to an unseen target domain. UDA methods are particularly impactful for semantic segmentation, where annotations are more difficult to collect than in image classification. Despite recent advances in large-scale vision-language representation learning, UDA methods for segmentation have not taken advantage of the domain-agnostic properties of text. To address this, we present a novel Covariance-based Pixel-Text loss, CoPT, that uses domain-agnostic text embeddings to learn domain-invariant features in an image segmentation encoder. The text embeddings are generated through our LLM Domain Template process, where an LLM is used to generate source and target domain descriptions that are fed to a frozen CLIP model and combined. In experiments on four benchmarks we show that a model trained using CoPT achieves the new state of the art performance on UDA for segmentation.

| **[Mask-Guided Attention U-Net for Enhanced Neonatal Brain Extraction and Image Preprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17709v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we introduce MGA-Net, a novel mask-guided attention neural network, which extends the U-net model for precision neonatal brain imaging. MGA-Net is designed to extract the brain from other structures and reconstruct high-quality brain images. The network employs a common encoder and two decoders: one for brain mask extraction and the other for brain region reconstruction. A key feature of MGA-Net is its high-level mask-guided attention module, which leverages features from the brain mask decoder to enhance image reconstruction. To enable the same encoder and decoder to process both MRI and ultrasound (US) images, MGA-Net integrates sinusoidal positional encoding. This encoding assigns distinct positional values to MRI and US images, allowing the model to effectively learn from both modalities. Consequently, features learned from a single modality can aid in learning a modality with less available data, such as US. We extensively validated the proposed MGA-Net on diverse datasets from varied clinical settings and neonatal age groups. The metrics used for assessment included the DICE similarity coefficient, recall, and accuracy for image segmentation; structural similarity for image reconstruction; and root mean squared error for total brain volume estimation from 3D ultrasound images. Our results demonstrate that MGA-Net significantly outperforms traditional methods, offering superior performance in brain extraction and segmentation while achieving high precision in image reconstruction and volumetric analysis. Thus, MGA-Net represents a robust and effective preprocessing tool for MRI and 3D ultrasound images, marking a significant advance in neuroimaging that enhances both research and clinical diagnostics in the neonatal period and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[RSRefSeg 2: Decoupling Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation with Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06231v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Remote Sensing Image Segmentation provides a flexible and fine-grained framework for remote sensing scene analysis via vision-language collaborative interpretation. Current approaches predominantly utilize a three-stage pipeline encompassing dual-modal encoding, cross-modal interaction, and pixel decoding. These methods demonstrate significant limitations in managing complex semantic relationships and achieving precise cross-modal alignment, largely due to their coupled processing mechanism that conflates target localization with boundary delineation. This architectural coupling amplifies error propagation under semantic ambiguity while restricting model generalizability and interpretability. To address these issues, we propose RSRefSeg 2, a decoupling paradigm that reformulates the conventional workflow into a collaborative dual-stage framework: coarse localization followed by fine segmentation. RSRefSeg 2 integrates CLIP's cross-modal alignment strength with SAM's segmentation generalizability through strategic foundation model collaboration. Specifically, CLIP is employed as the dual-modal encoder to activate target features within its pre-aligned semantic space and generate localization prompts. To mitigate CLIP's misactivation challenges in multi-entity scenarios described by referring texts, a cascaded second-order prompter is devised, which enhances precision through implicit reasoning via decomposition of text embeddings into complementary semantic subspaces. These optimized semantic prompts subsequently direct the SAM to generate pixel-level refined masks, thereby completing the semantic transmission pipeline. Extensive experiments (RefSegRS, RRSIS-D, and RISBench) demonstrate that RSRefSeg 2 surpasses contemporary methods in segmentation accuracy (+~3% gIoU) and complex semantic interpretation.

| **[Lightweight Medical Image Restoration via Integrating Reliable Lesion-Semantic Driven Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11286v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image restoration tasks aim to recover high-quality images from degraded observations, exhibiting emergent desires in many clinical scenarios, such as low-dose CT image denoising, MRI super-resolution, and MRI artifact removal. Despite the success achieved by existing deep learning-based restoration methods with sophisticated modules, they struggle with rendering computationally-efficient reconstruction results. Moreover, they usually ignore the reliability of the restoration results, which is much more urgent in medical systems. To alleviate these issues, we present LRformer, a Lightweight Transformer-based method via Reliability-guided learning in the frequency domain. Specifically, inspired by the uncertainty quantification in Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), we develop a Reliable Lesion-Semantic Prior Producer (RLPP). RLPP leverages Monte Carlo (MC) estimators with stochastic sampling operations to generate sufficiently-reliable priors by performing multiple inferences on the foundational medical image segmentation model, MedSAM. Additionally, instead of directly incorporating the priors in the spatial domain, we decompose the cross-attention (CA) mechanism into real symmetric and imaginary anti-symmetric parts via fast Fourier transform (FFT), resulting in the design of the Guided Frequency Cross-Attention (GFCA) solver. By leveraging the conjugated symmetric property of FFT, GFCA reduces the computational complexity of naive CA by nearly half. Extensive experimental results in various tasks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed LRformer in both effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

However, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) introduces a new prompt-driven paradigm for image segmentation, offering new possibilities. In this study, we investigate SAM's potential for UVOS through different prompt strategies. We then propose UVOSAM, a mask-free paradigm for UVOS that utilizes the STD-Net tracker. STD-Net incorporates a spatial-temporal decoupled deformable attention mechanism to establish an effective correlation between intra- and inter-frame features, remarkably enhancing the quality of box prompts in complex video scenes. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS2017-unsupervised and YoutubeVIS19\&21 datasets demonstrate the superior performance of UVOSAM without mask supervision compared to existing mask-supervised methods, as well as its ability to generalize to weakly-annotated video datasets.

| **[Just Say Better or Worse: A Human-AI Collaborative Framework for Medical Image Segmentation Without Manual Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05815v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manual annotation of medical images is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process, posing a significant bottleneck in the development and deployment of robust medical imaging AI systems. This paper introduces a novel Human-AI collaborative framework for medical image segmentation that substantially reduces the annotation burden by eliminating the need for explicit manual pixel-level labeling. The core innovation lies in a preference learning paradigm, where human experts provide minimal, intuitive feedback -- simply indicating whether an AI-generated segmentation is better or worse than a previous version. The framework comprises four key components: (1) an adaptable foundation model (FM) for feature extraction, (2) label propagation based on feature similarity, (3) a clicking agent that learns from human better-or-worse feedback to decide where to click and with which label, and (4) a multi-round segmentation learning procedure that trains a state-of-the-art segmentation network using pseudo-labels generated by the clicking agent and FM-based label propagation. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive segmentation performance using only binary preference feedback, without requiring experts to directly manually annotate the images.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Are Vision xLSTM Embedded UNet More Reliable in Medical 3D Image Segmentation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16993v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of efficient segmentation strategies for medical images has evolved from its initial dependence on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to the current investigation of hybrid models that combine CNNs with Vision Transformers (ViTs). There is an increasing focus on creating architectures that are both high-performing and computationally efficient, capable of being deployed on remote systems with limited resources. Although transformers can capture global dependencies in the input space, they face challenges from the corresponding high computational and storage expenses involved. This research investigates the integration of CNNs with Vision Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Vision-xLSTM)s by introducing the novel U-VixLSTM. The Vision-xLSTM blocks capture the temporal and global relationships within the patches extracted from the CNN feature maps. The convolutional feature reconstruction path upsamples the output volume from the Vision-xLSTM blocks to produce the segmentation output. Our primary objective is to propose that Vision-xLSTM forms an appropriate backbone for medical image segmentation, offering excellent performance with reduced computational costs. The U-VixLSTM exhibits superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art networks in the publicly available Synapse, ISIC and ACDC datasets.

We present OpenWorldSAM, a framework that extends the prompt-driven Segment Anything Model v2 (SAM2) to open-vocabulary scenarios by integrating multi-modal embeddings extracted from a lightweight vision-language model (VLM). Our approach is guided by four key principles: i) Unified prompting: OpenWorldSAM supports a diverse range of prompts, including category-level and sentence-level language descriptions, providing a flexible interface for various segmentation tasks. ii) Efficiency: By freezing the pre-trained components of SAM2 and the VLM, we train only 4.5 million parameters on the COCO-stuff dataset, achieving remarkable resource efficiency. iii) Instance Awareness: We enhance the model's spatial understanding through novel positional tie-breaker embeddings and cross-attention layers, enabling effective segmentation of multiple instances. iv) Generalization: OpenWorldSAM exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities, generalizing well on unseen categories and an open vocabulary of concepts without additional training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenWorldSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance in open-vocabulary semantic, instance, and panoptic segmentation across multiple benchmarks, including ADE20k, PASCAL, ScanNet, and SUN-RGBD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficacy of Image Similarity as a Metric for Augmenting Small Dataset Retinal Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04862v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthetic images are an option for augmenting limited medical imaging datasets to improve the performance of various machine learning models. A common metric for evaluating synthetic image quality is the Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) which measures the similarity of two image datasets. In this study we evaluate the relationship between this metric and the improvement which synthetic images, generated by a Progressively Growing Generative Adversarial Network (PGGAN), grant when augmenting Diabetes-related Macular Edema (DME) intraretinal fluid segmentation performed by a U-Net model with limited amounts of training data. We find that the behaviour of augmenting with standard and synthetic images agrees with previously conducted experiments. Additionally, we show that dissimilar (high FID) datasets do not improve segmentation significantly. As FID between the training and augmenting datasets decreases, the augmentation datasets are shown to contribute to significant and robust improvements in image segmentation. Finally, we find that there is significant evidence to suggest that synthetic and standard augmentations follow separate log-normal trends between FID and improvements in model performance, with synthetic data proving more effective than standard augmentation techniques. Our findings show that more similar datasets (lower FID) will be more effective at improving U-Net performance, however, the results also suggest that this improvement may only occur when images are sufficiently dissimilar.</p></details> | 30 pages, 10 figures |

Semi-supervised learning offers a promising approach to enhance model performance by leveraging unlabeled data. Although weak-to-strong consistency is a prevalent method in semi-supervised image segmentation, there is a scarcity of research on perturbation strategies specifically tailored for semi-supervised medical image segmentation tasks. To address this challenge, this paper introduces a simple yet efficient semi-supervised learning framework named Attention-Guided weak-to-strong Consistency Match (AIGCMatch). The AIGCMatch framework incorporates attention-guided perturbation strategies at both the image and feature levels to achieve weak-to-strong consistency regularization. This method not only preserves the structural information of medical images but also enhances the model's ability to process complex semantic information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ACDC and ISIC-2017 datasets have validated the effectiveness of AIGCMatch. Our method achieved a 90.4\% Dice score in the 7-case scenario on the ACDC dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods and demonstrating its potential and efficacy in clinical settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weakly Supervised Segmentation Framework for Thyroid Nodule Based on High-confidence Labels and High-rationality Losses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19707v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised segmentation methods can delineate thyroid nodules in ultrasound images efficiently using training data with coarse labels, but suffer from: 1) low-confidence pseudo-labels that follow topological priors, introducing significant label noise, and 2) low-rationality loss functions that rigidly compare segmentation with labels, ignoring discriminative information for nodules with diverse and complex shapes. To solve these issues, we clarify the objective and references for weakly supervised ultrasound image segmentation, presenting a framework with high-confidence pseudo-labels to represent topological and anatomical information and high-rationality losses to capture multi-level discriminative features. Specifically, we fuse geometric transformations of four-point annotations and MedSAM model results prompted by specific annotations to generate high-confidence box, foreground, and background labels. Our high-rationality learning strategy includes: 1) Alignment loss measuring spatial consistency between segmentation and box label, and topological continuity within the foreground label, guiding the network to perceive nodule location; 2) Contrastive loss pulling features from labeled foreground regions while pushing features from labeled foreground and background regions, guiding the network to learn nodule and background feature distribution; 3) Prototype correlation loss measuring consistency between correlation maps derived by comparing features with foreground and background prototypes, refining uncertain regions to accurate nodule edges. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the TN3K and DDTI datasets.

However, deep learning itself requires a large amount of training data and the medical image segmentation masking, in particular, requires an extremely high cost due to the shortage of medical specialists. To mitigate this issue, we propose a new data augmentation method built upon the conventional Copy and Paste (CP) augmentation technique, called CP-Dilatation, and apply it to histopathology image segmentation. To the well-known traditional CP technique, the proposed method adds a dilation operation that can preserve the boundary context information of the malignancy, which is important in histopathological image diagnosis, as the boundary between the malignancy and its margin is mostly unclear and a significant context exists in the margin. In our experiments using histopathology benchmark datasets, the proposed method was found superior to the other state-of-the-art baselines chosen for comparison.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Training-Free Reference-Based Instance Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02798v2)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of image segmentation models has historically been constrained by the high cost of collecting large-scale annotated data. The Segment Anything Model (SAM) alleviates this original problem through a promptable, semantics-agnostic, segmentation paradigm and yet still requires manual visual-prompts or complex domain-dependent prompt-generation rules to process a new image. Towards reducing this new burden, our work investigates the task of object segmentation when provided with, alternatively, only a small set of reference images. Our key insight is to leverage strong semantic priors, as learned by foundation models, to identify corresponding regions between a reference and a target image. We find that correspondences enable automatic generation of instance-level segmentation masks for downstream tasks and instantiate our ideas via a multi-stage, training-free method incorporating (1) memory bank construction; (2) representation aggregation and (3) semantic-aware feature matching. Our experiments show significant improvements on segmentation metrics, leading to state-of-the-art performance on COCO FSOD (36.8% nAP), PASCAL VOC Few-Shot (71.2% nAP50) and outperforming existing training-free approaches on the Cross-Domain FSOD benchmark (22.4% nAP).</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Static Segmentation by Tracking: A Label-Efficient Approach for Fine-Grained Specimen Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06749v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study image segmentation in the biological domain, particularly trait segmentation from specimen images (e.g., butterfly wing stripes, beetle elytra). This fine-grained task is crucial for understanding the biology of organisms, but it traditionally requires manually annotating segmentation masks for hundreds of images per species, making it highly labor-intensive. To address this challenge, we propose a label-efficient approach, Static Segmentation by Tracking (SST), based on a key insight: while specimens of the same species exhibit natural variation, the traits of interest show up consistently. This motivates us to concatenate specimen images into a ``pseudo-video'' and reframe trait segmentation as a tracking problem. Specifically, SST generates masks for unlabeled images by propagating annotated or predicted masks from the ``pseudo-preceding'' images. Built upon recent video segmentation models, such as Segment Anything Model 2, SST achieves high-quality trait segmentation with only one labeled image per species, marking a breakthrough in specimen image analysis. To further enhance segmentation quality, we introduce a cycle-consistent loss for fine-tuning, again requiring only one labeled image. Additionally, we demonstrate the broader potential of SST, including one-shot instance segmentation in natural images and trait-based image retrieval.</p></details> |  |

However, current publicly available datasets exhibit limitations, such as overly simplistic scenarios, low-resolution footage, and insufficiently diverse conditions, creating a considerable gap between academic research and real-world scenario. To fill this gap, we introduce RoundaboutHD, a comprehensive, high-resolution multi-camera vehicle tracking benchmark dataset specifically designed to represent real-world roundabout scenarios. RoundaboutHD provides a total of 40 minutes of labelled video footage captured by four non-overlapping, high-resolution (4K resolution, 15 fps) cameras. In total, 512 unique vehicle identities are annotated across different camera views, offering rich cross-camera association data. RoundaboutHD offers temporal consistency video footage and enhanced challenges, including increased occlusions and nonlinear movement inside the roundabout. In addition to the full MCVT dataset, several subsets are also available for object detection, single camera tracking, and image-based vehicle re-identification (ReID) tasks. Vehicle model information and camera modelling/ geometry information are also included to support further analysis. We provide baseline results for vehicle detection, single-camera tracking, image-based vehicle re-identification, and multi-camera tracking. The dataset and the evaluation code are publicly available at: https://github.com/siri-rouser/RoundaboutHD.git</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Context Bias in Domain Adaptation for Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14679v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Domain adaptation for object detection (DAOD) has become essential to counter performance degradation caused by distribution shifts between training and deployment domains. However, a critical factor influencing DAOD - context bias resulting from learned foreground-background (FG-BG) associations - has remained underexplored. We address three key questions regarding FG BG associations in object detection: are FG-BG associations encoded during the training, is there a causal relationship between FG-BG associations and detection performance, and is there an effect of FG-BG association on DAOD. To examine how models capture FG BG associations, we analyze class-wise and feature-wise performance degradation using background masking and feature perturbation, measured via change in accuracies (defined as drop rate). To explore the causal role of FG-BG associations, we apply do-calculus on FG-BG pairs guided by class activation mapping (CAM). To quantify the causal influence of FG-BG associations across domains, we propose a novel metric - domain association gradient - defined as the ratio of drop rate to maximum mean discrepancy (MMD). Through systematic experiments involving background masking, feature-level perturbations, and CAM, we reveal that convolution-based object detection models encode FG-BG associations. Our results demonstrate that context bias not only exists but causally undermines the generalization capabilities of object detection models across domains. Furthermore, we validate these findings across multiple models and datasets, including state-of-the-art architectures such as ALDI++. This study highlights the necessity of addressing context bias explicitly in DAOD frameworks, providing insights that pave the way for developing more robust and generalizable object detection systems.</p></details> | Under review |

Large models offer a solution via data generation. Nonetheless, real-world data are obviously more valuable comparing to artificially intelligence generated data, particularly in constructing image datasets. For this reason, we propose a novel method for auto-constructing datasets from real-world images by a multiagent collaborative system, named as DatasetAgent. By coordinating four different agents equipped with Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs), as well as a tool package for image optimization, DatasetAgent is able to construct high-quality image datasets according to user-specified requirements. In particular, two types of experiments are conducted, including expanding existing datasets and creating new ones from scratch, on a variety of open-source datasets. In both cases, multiple image datasets constructed by DatasetAgent are used to train various vision models for image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Several studies have shown that the performance of these 3D perception methods can be further enhanced by combining sequential BEV features obtained from multiple camera frames. However, even after compensating for the ego-motion of an autonomous agent, the performance gain from temporal aggregation is limited when combining a large number of image frames. This limitation arises due to dynamic changes in BEV features over time caused by object motion. In this paper, we introduce a novel temporal 3D perception method called OnlineBEV, which combines BEV features over time using a recurrent structure. This structure increases the effective number of combined features with minimal memory usage. However, it is critical to spatially align the features over time to maintain strong performance. OnlineBEV employs the Motion-guided BEV Fusion Network (MBFNet) to achieve temporal feature alignment. MBFNet extracts motion features from consecutive BEV frames and dynamically aligns historical BEV features with current ones using these motion features. To enforce temporal feature alignment explicitly, we use Temporal Consistency Learning Loss, which captures discrepancies between historical and target BEV features. Experiments conducted on the nuScenes benchmark demonstrate that OnlineBEV achieves significant performance gains over the current best method, SOLOFusion. OnlineBEV achieves 63.9% NDS on the nuScenes test set, recording state-of-the-art performance in the camera-only 3D object detection task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems</p></details> |

The proposed ODOR dataset fills this gap, offering 38,116 object-level annotations across 4712 images, spanning an extensive set of 139 fine-grained categories. Conducting a statistical analysis, we showcase challenging dataset properties, such as a detailed set of categories, dense and overlapping objects, and spatial distribution over the whole image canvas. Furthermore, we provide an extensive baseline analysis for object detection models and highlight the challenging properties of the dataset through a set of secondary studies. Inspiring further research on artwork object detection and broader visual cultural heritage studies, the dataset challenges researchers to explore the intersection of object recognition and smell perception.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Driving Risks using Large Language Models: Toward Elderly Driver Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08367v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the potential of a multimodal large language model (LLM), specifically ChatGPT-4o, to perform human-like interpretations of traffic scenes using static dashcam images. Herein, we focus on three judgment tasks relevant to elderly driver assessments: evaluating traffic density, assessing intersection visibility, and recognizing stop signs recognition. These tasks require contextual reasoning rather than simple object detection. Using zero-shot, few-shot, and multi-shot prompting strategies, we evaluated the performance of the model with human annotations serving as the reference standard. Evaluation metrics included precision, recall, and F1-score. Results indicate that prompt design considerably affects performance, with recall for intersection visibility increasing from 21.7% (zero-shot) to 57.0% (multi-shot). For traffic density, agreement increased from 53.5% to 67.6%. In stop-sign detection, the model demonstrated high precision (up to 86.3%) but a lower recall (approximately 76.7%), indicating a conservative response tendency. Output stability analysis revealed that humans and the model faced difficulties interpreting structurally ambiguous scenes. However, the model's explanatory texts corresponded with its predictions, enhancing interpretability. These findings suggest that, with well-designed prompts, LLMs hold promise as supportive tools for scene-level driving risk assessments. Future studies should explore scalability using larger datasets, diverse annotators, and next-generation model architectures for elderly driver assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVT: Efficient View Transformation for Multi-Modal 3D Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10715v4)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal sensor fusion in Bird's Eye View (BEV) representation has become the leading approach for 3D object detection. However, existing methods often rely on depth estimators or transformer encoders to transform image features into BEV space, which reduces robustness or introduces significant computational overhead. Moreover, the insufficient geometric guidance in view transformation results in ray-directional misalignments, limiting the effectiveness of BEV representations. To address these challenges, we propose Efficient View Transformation (EVT), a novel 3D object detection framework that constructs a well-structured BEV representation, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Our approach focuses on two key aspects. First, Adaptive Sampling and Adaptive Projection (ASAP), which utilizes LiDAR guidance to generate 3D sampling points and adaptive kernels, enables more effective transformation of image features into BEV space and a refined BEV representation. Second, an improved query-based detection framework, incorporating group-wise mixed query selection and geometry-aware cross-attention, effectively captures both the common properties and the geometric structure of objects in the transformer decoder. On the nuScenes test set, EVT achieves state-of-the-art performance of 75.3% NDS with real-time inference speed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, conventional interpretation methods are often limited by noise sensitivity and a lack of structural awareness. This study presents a novel framework that enhances the detection of underground utilities, especially pipelines, by integrating shape-aware topological features derived from B-scan GPR images using Topological Data Analysis (TDA), with the spatial detection capabilities of the YOLOv5 deep neural network (DNN). We propose a novel shape-aware topological representation that amplifies structural features in the input data, thereby improving the model's responsiveness to the geometrical features of buried objects. To address the scarcity of annotated real-world data, we employ a Sim2Real strategy that generates diverse and realistic synthetic datasets, effectively bridging the gap between simulated and real-world domains. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in mean Average Precision (mAP), validating the robustness and efficacy of our approach. This approach underscores the potential of TDA-enhanced learning in achieving reliable, real-time subsurface object detection, with broad applications in urban planning, safety inspection, and infrastructure management.</p></details> | 15 pages, 6 figures |

With many injuries taking place through road accidents on a daily basis, it is paramount for a system to be developed that can alert the visually impaired of objects at close distance beforehand. To overcome this issue, a novel alert system is proposed in this research to assist the visually impaired in commuting through these busy streets without colliding with any objects. The proposed system can alert the individual to objects that are present at a close distance. It utilizes transfer learning to train models for depth estimation and object detection, and combines both models to introduce a novel system. The models are optimized through the utilization of quantization techniques to make them lightweight and efficient, allowing them to be easily deployed on embedded systems. The proposed solution achieved a lightweight real-time depth estimation and object detection model with an mAP50 of 0.801.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rainbow Artifacts from Electromagnetic Signal Injection Attacks on Image Sensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07773v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image sensors are integral to a wide range of safety- and security-critical systems, including surveillance infrastructure, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. These systems rely on the integrity of visual data to make decisions. In this work, we investigate a novel class of electromagnetic signal injection attacks that target the analog domain of image sensors, allowing adversaries to manipulate raw visual inputs without triggering conventional digital integrity checks. We uncover a previously undocumented attack phenomenon on CMOS image sensors: rainbow-like color artifacts induced in images captured by image sensors through carefully tuned electromagnetic interference. We further evaluate the impact of these attacks on state-of-the-art object detection models, showing that the injected artifacts propagate through the image signal processing pipeline and lead to significant mispredictions. Our findings highlight a critical and underexplored vulnerability in the visual perception stack, highlighting the need for more robust defenses against physical-layer attacks in such systems.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Stabilization for Small Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01803v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite advances in generic object detection, there remains a performance gap in detecting small objects compared to normal-scale objects. We reveal that conventional object localization methods suffer from gradient instability in small objects due to sharper loss curvature, leading to a convergence challenge. To address the issue, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Gradient Stabilization (UGS), a framework that reformulates object localization as a classification task to stabilize gradients. UGS quantizes continuous labels into interval non-uniform discrete representations. Under a classification-based objective, the localization branch generates bounded and confidence-driven gradients, mitigating instability. Furthermore, UGS integrates an uncertainty minimization (UM) loss that reduces prediction variance and an uncertainty-guided refinement (UR) module that identifies and refines high-uncertainty regions via perturbations. Evaluated on four benchmarks, UGS consistently improves anchor-based, anchor-free, and leading small object detectors. Especially, UGS enhances DINO-5scale by 2.6 AP on VisDrone, surpassing previous state-of-the-art results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RT-OVAD: Real-Time Open-Vocabulary Aerial Object Detection via Image-Text Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12246v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial object detection plays a crucial role in numerous applications. However, most existing methods focus on detecting predefined object categories, limiting their applicability in real-world open scenarios. In this paper, we extend aerial object detection to open scenarios through image-text collaboration and propose RT-OVAD, the first real-time open-vocabulary detector for aerial scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an image-to-text alignment loss to replace the conventional category regression loss, thereby eliminating category constraints. Next, we propose a lightweight image-text collaboration strategy comprising an image-text collaboration encoder and a text-guided decoder. The encoder simultaneously enhances visual features and refines textual embeddings, while the decoder guides object queries to focus on class-relevant image features. This design further improves detection accuracy without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RT-OVAD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across open-vocabulary, zero-shot, and traditional closed-set detection tasks. For instance, on the open-vocabulary aerial detection benchmarks DIOR, DOTA-v2.0, and LAE-80C, RT-OVAD achieves 87.7 AP$_{50}$, 53.8 mAP, and 23.7 mAP, respectively, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art (LAE-DINO) by 2.2, 7.0, and 3.5 points. In addition, RT-OVAD achieves an inference speed of 34 FPS on an RTX 4090 GPU, approximately three times faster than LAE-DINO (10 FPS), meeting the real-time detection requirements of diverse applications. The code will be released at https://github.com/GT-Wei/RT-OVAD.</p></details> |  |

Collective perception, which enables vehicles to share information, offers a promising approach to overcoming these limitations. However, to this date collective perception in adverse weather is mostly unstudied. Therefore, we conduct the first study of LiDAR-based collective perception under diverse weather conditions and present a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under adverse weather. Adverse weather conditions can not only degrade perception capabilities, but also negatively affect bandwidth requirements and latency due to the introduced noise that is also transmitted and processed. Denoising prior to communication can effectively mitigate these issues. Therefore, we propose DenoiseCP-Net, a novel multi-task architecture for LiDAR-based collective perception under adverse weather conditions. DenoiseCP-Net integrates voxel-level noise filtering and object detection into a unified sparse convolution backbone, eliminating redundant computations associated with two-stage pipelines. This design not only reduces inference latency and computational cost but also minimizes communication overhead by removing non-informative noise. We extended the well-known OPV2V dataset by simulating rain, snow, and fog using our realistic weather simulation models. We demonstrate that DenoiseCP-Net achieves near-perfect denoising accuracy in adverse weather, reduces the bandwidth requirements by up to 23.6% while maintaining the same detection accuracy and reducing the inference latency for cooperative vehicles.</p></details> |  |

High-throughput approaches are crucial for accelerating our understanding of insect diversity, with DNA barcoding and high-resolution imaging showing strong potential for automatic taxonomic classification. However, most image-based approaches rely on individual specimen data, unlike the unsorted bulk samples collected in large-scale ecological surveys. We present the Mixed Arthropod Sample Segmentation and Identification (MassID45) dataset for training automatic classifiers of bulk insect samples. It uniquely combines molecular and imaging data at both the unsorted sample level and the full set of individual specimens. Human annotators, supported by an AI-assisted tool, performed two tasks on bulk images: creating segmentation masks around each individual arthropod and assigning taxonomic labels to over 17 000 specimens. Combining the taxonomic resolution of DNA barcodes with precise abundance estimates of bulk images holds great potential for rapid, large-scale characterization of insect communities. This dataset pushes the boundaries of tiny object detection and instance segmentation, fostering innovation in both ecological and machine learning research.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, submitted to Scientific Data</p></details> |

However, several recent studies have shown that object detectors can be easily fooled by physically realizable attacks, \eg, adversarial patches and recent adversarial textures, which pose realistic and urgent threats. Adversarial Training (AT) has been recognized as the most effective defense against adversarial attacks. While AT has been extensively studied in the $l_\infty$ attack settings on classification models, AT against physically realizable attacks on object detectors has received limited exploration. Early attempts are only performed to defend against adversarial patches, leaving AT against a wider range of physically realizable attacks under-explored. In this work, we consider defending against various physically realizable attacks with a unified AT method. We propose PBCAT, a novel Patch-Based Composite Adversarial Training strategy. PBCAT optimizes the model by incorporating the combination of small-area gradient-guided adversarial patches and imperceptible global adversarial perturbations covering the entire image. With these designs, PBCAT has the potential to defend against not only adversarial patches but also unseen physically realizable attacks such as adversarial textures. Extensive experiments in multiple settings demonstrated that PBCAT significantly improved robustness against various physically realizable attacks over state-of-the-art defense methods. Notably, it improved the detection accuracy by 29.7\% over previous defense methods under one recent adversarial texture attack.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, the scarcity of large-scale, diverse thermal aerial datasets limits the advancement of deep learning models in this domain, primarily due to the high cost and logistical challenges of collecting thermal data. In this work, we introduce a novel procedural pipeline for generating synthetic thermal images from an aerial perspective. Our method integrates arbitrary object classes into existing thermal backgrounds by providing control over the position, scale, and orientation of the new objects, while aligning them with the viewpoints of the background. We enhance existing thermal datasets by introducing new object categories, specifically adding a drone class in urban environments to the HIT-UAV dataset and an animal category to the MONET dataset. In evaluating these datasets for object detection task, we showcase strong performance across both new and existing classes, validating the successful expansion into new applications. Through comparative analysis, we show that thermal detectors outperform their visible-light-trained counterparts and highlight the importance of replicating aerial viewing angles.

When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and compare it with the oracle approach.</p></details> | Preprint. ICUAS 2025 |

Traditional methods often struggle to integrate these components effectively, and this limits their capability to deal with complex, long-range navigation missions. In this paper, we propose LOVON, a novel framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for hierarchical task planning with open-vocabulary visual detection models, tailored for effective long-range object navigation in dynamic, unstructured environments. To tackle real-world challenges including visual jittering, blind zones, and temporary target loss, we design dedicated solutions such as Laplacian Variance Filtering for visual stabilization. We also develop a functional execution logic for the robot that guarantees LOVON's capabilities in autonomous navigation, task adaptation, and robust task completion. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the successful completion of long-sequence tasks involving real-time detection, search, and navigation toward open-vocabulary dynamic targets. Furthermore, real-world experiments across different legged robots (Unitree Go2, B2, and H1-2) showcase the compatibility and appealing plug-and-play feature of LOVON.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures; Project Page: https://daojiepeng.github.io/LOVON/</p></details> |

These factors create an information bottleneck where limited pixel representation cannot encode sufficient discriminative features. B2BDet addresses this with a two-stage framework that applies domain-specific super-resolution during inference, followed by detection using an enhanced YOLOv5 architecture. Unlike training-time super-resolution approaches that enhance learned representations, our method recovers visual information from each input image. The approach combines aerial-optimized SRGAN fine-tuning with architectural innovations including an Efficient Attention Module (EAM) and Cross-Layer Feature Pyramid Network (CLFPN). Evaluation across four aerial datasets shows performance gains, with VisDrone achieving 52.5% mAP using only 27.7M parameters. Ablation studies show that super-resolution preprocessing contributes +2.6% mAP improvement while architectural enhancements add +2.9%, yielding +5.5% total improvement over baseline YOLOv5. The method achieves computational efficiency with 53.8% parameter reduction compared to recent approaches while achieving strong small object detection performance.</p></details> |  |

A rate shift is needed to extract data from specimen images efficiently, moving beyond human-mediated transcription. We developed `Hespi' (HErbarium Specimen sheet PIpeline) using advanced computer vision techniques to extract pre-catalogue data from primary specimen labels on herbarium specimens. Hespi integrates two object detection models: one for detecting the components of the sheet and another for fields on the primary primary specimen label. It classifies labels as printed, typed, handwritten, or mixed and uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) for extraction. The text is then corrected against authoritative taxon databases and refined using a multimodal Large Language Model (LLM). Hespi accurately detects and extracts text from specimen sheets across international herbaria, and its modular design allows users to train and integrate custom models.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

Traditional frame-based vision systems suffer from motion blur, high latency, and redundant data processing, limiting their performance in dynamic environments. Event cameras, which capture asynchronous brightness changes at the pixel level, offer a promising alternative but pose challenges in object detection due to sparse and noisy event streams. To address this, we propose an event autoencoder architecture that efficiently compresses and reconstructs event data while preserving critical spatial and temporal features. The proposed model employs convolutional encoding and incorporates adaptive threshold selection and a lightweight classifier to enhance recognition accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Experimental results on the existing Smart Event Face Dataset (SEFD) demonstrate that our approach achieves comparable accuracy to the YOLO-v4 model while utilizing up to $35.5\times$ fewer parameters. Implementations on embedded platforms, including Raspberry Pi 4B and NVIDIA Jetson Nano, show high frame rates ranging from 8 FPS up to 44.8 FPS. The proposed classifier exhibits up to 87.84x better FPS than the state-of-the-art and significantly improves event-based vision performance, making it ideal for low-power, high-speed applications in real-time edge computing.</p></details> |  |

We thoroughly explore the rich spatio-temporal properties of transformers within a multi-stage architecture paradigm for the temporal action localization (TAL) task. This exploration led to the development of a hierarchical multi-stage transformer architecture called PCL-Former, where each subtask is handled by a dedicated transformer module with a specialized loss function. Specifically, the Proposal-Former identifies candidate segments in an untrimmed video that may contain actions, the Classification-Former classifies the action categories within those segments, and the Localization-Former precisely predicts the temporal boundaries (i.e., start and end) of the action instances. To evaluate the performance of our method, we have conducted extensive experiments on three challenging benchmark datasets: THUMOS-14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS Segments. We also conducted detailed ablation experiments to assess the impact of each individual module of our PCL-Former. The obtained quantitative results validate the effectiveness of the proposed PCL-Former, outperforming state-of-the-art TAL approaches by 2.8%, 1.2%, and 4.8% on THUMOS14, ActivityNet-1.3, and HACS datasets, respectively.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures, |

However, most existing methods face challenges in maintaining robustness under complex weather conditions, which limits their applicability. Meanwhile, the reliance on attention mechanisms in modality fusion introduces significant computational complexity and storage overhead, particularly when dealing with high-resolution images. To address these challenges, we propose the Cross-modality Fusion Mamba with Weather-removal (CFMW) to augment stability and cost-effectiveness under adverse weather conditions. Leveraging the proposed Perturbation-Adaptive Diffusion Model (PADM) and Cross-modality Fusion Mamba (CFM) modules, CFMW is able to reconstruct visual features affected by adverse weather, enriching the representation of image details. With efficient architecture design, CFMW is 3 times faster than Transformer-style fusion (e.g., CFT). To bridge the gap in relevant datasets, we construct a new Severe Weather Visible-Infrared (SWVI) dataset, encompassing diverse adverse weather scenarios such as rain, haze, and snow. The dataset contains 64,281 paired visible-infrared images, providing a valuable resource for future research. Extensive experiments on public datasets (i.e., M3FD and LLVIP) and the newly constructed SWVI dataset conclusively demonstrate that CFMW achieves state-of-the-art detection performance.

However, these tasks place substantial demands on resource constrained edge devices, making the joint optimization of energy consumption and detection accuracy critical. To address this challenge, we propose ECORE, a framework that integrates multiple dynamic routing strategies including estimation based techniques and a greedy selection algorithm to direct image processing requests to the most suitable edge device-model pair. ECORE dynamically balances energy efficiency and detection performance based on object characteristics. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, comparing the proposed routers against widely used baseline techniques. The evaluation leverages established object detection models (YOLO, SSD, EfficientDet) and diverse edge platforms, including Jetson Orin Nano, Raspberry Pi 4 and 5, and TPU accelerators.

A critical challenge in GUI automation is the precise grounding of interface elements across diverse platforms. Existing vision-only GUI agents directly ground elements from large and cluttered screenshots, requiring them to process substantial irrelevant information that compromises their accuracy. In addition, these approaches typically employ basic cross-entropy loss for learning grounding objectives, which fails to effectively capture grounding quality compared to established object detection metrics like Intersection-over-Union (IoU). To address these issues, we introduce R-VLM, a novel GUI grounding approach that leverages zoomed-in region proposals for precise element localization. We also propose an IoU-aware objective function that facilitates model convergence toward high IoU predictions. Our approach bridges the gap between VLMs and conventional object detection techniques, improving the state-of-the-art grounding accuracy by 13% across diverse GUI platforms on the GUI grounding benchmarks ScreenSpot and AgentStudio. In addition, our R-VLM approach shows 3.2-9.7% absolute accuracy improvements in GUI navigation tasks on the AITW and Mind2Web benchmarks.</p></details> | ACL 2025; 17 pages |

Current algorithms often depend on hand-crafted components like anchor boxes, which demand fine-tuning and exhibit limited generalization, and Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS), which is threshold-sensitive and prone to misclassifying dense objects. These generic architectures thus struggle to adapt to aerial imaging characteristics, resulting in performance limitations. Moreover, emerging end-to-end frameworks have yet to effectively mitigate these aerial-specific challenges.To address these issues, we propose HEGS-DETR, a comprehensively enhanced, real-time Detection Transformer framework tailored for UAVs. First, we introduce the High-Frequency Enhanced Semantics Network (HFESNet) as a novel backbone. HFESNet preserves critical high-frequency spatial details to extract robust semantic features, thereby improving discriminative capability for small and occluded targets in complex backgrounds. Second, our Efficient Small Object Pyramid (ESOP) strategy strategically fuses high-resolution feature maps with minimal computational overhead, significantly boosting small object detection. Finally, the proposed Selective Query Recollection (SQR) and Geometry-Aware Positional Encoding (GAPE) modules enhance the detector's decoder stability and localization accuracy, effectively optimizing bounding boxes and providing explicit spatial priors for dense scenes. Experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate that HEGS-DETR achieves a 5.1% AP50 and 3.8% AP increase over the baseline, while maintaining real-time speed and reducing parameter count by 4M.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 9 figures, to appear in KBS</p></details> |

The model stores information from previous frames in a memory bank, enabling temporal consistency across video sequences. Recent methods augment SAM 2 with hand-crafted update rules to better handle distractors, occlusions, and object motion. We propose a fundamentally different approach using reinforcement learning for optimizing memory updates in SAM 2 by framing memory control as a sequential decision-making problem. In an overfitting setup with a separate agent per video, our method achieves a relative improvement over SAM 2 that exceeds by more than three times the gains of existing heuristics. These results reveal the untapped potential of the memory bank and highlight reinforcement learning as a powerful alternative to hand-crafted update rules for memory control in visual object tracking.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a hierarchical motion estimation strategy, combining lightweight linear prediction with selective non-linear refinement to improve tracking accuracy without requiring additional training. In addition, we optimize the memory bank by distinguishing long-term and short-term memory frames, enabling more reliable tracking under long-term occlusions and appearance changes. Experimental results show consistent improvements across different model scales. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on LaSOT and LaSOText with the large model, achieving 9.6% and 7.2% relative improvements in AUC over the original SAM2, and demonstrates even larger relative gains on smaller models, highlighting the effectiveness of our trainless, low-overhead improvements for boosting long-term tracking performance.

However, the VOT community has largely overlooked video data-privacy issues, as many private videos have been collected and used for training commercial models without authorization. To alleviate these issues, this paper presents the first investigation on preventing personal video data from unauthorized exploitation by deep trackers. Existing methods for preventing unauthorized data use primarily focus on image-based tasks (e.g., image classification), directly applying them to videos reveals several limitations, including inefficiency, limited effectiveness, and poor generalizability. To address these issues, we propose a novel generative framework for generating Temporal Unlearnable Examples (TUEs), and whose efficient computation makes it scalable for usage on large-scale video datasets. The trackers trained w/ TUEs heavily rely on unlearnable noises for temporal matching, ignoring the original data structure and thus ensuring training video data-privacy. To enhance the effectiveness of TUEs, we introduce a temporal contrastive loss, which further corrupts the learning of existing trackers when using our TUEs for training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in video data-privacy protection, with strong transferability across VOT models, datasets, and temporal matching tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work has focused evaluations on semantic-related tasks $\unicode{x2013}$ action classification, ImageNet classification, etc. In this paper we focus on evaluating self-supervised learning on non-semantic vision tasks that are more spatial (3D) and temporal (+1D = 4D), such as camera pose estimation, point and object tracking, and depth estimation. We show that by learning from very large video datasets, masked auto-encoding (MAE) with transformer video models actually scales, consistently improving performance on these 4D tasks, as model size increases from 20M all the way to the largest by far reported self-supervised video model $\unicode{x2013}$ 22B parameters. Rigorous apples-to-apples comparison with many recent image and video models demonstrates the benefits of scaling 4D representations.

| **[DecoderTracker: Decoder-Only Method for Multiple-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17170v6)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decoder-only methods, such as GPT, have demonstrated superior performance in many areas compared to traditional encoder-decoder structure transformer methods. Over the years, end-to-end methods based on the traditional transformer structure, like MOTR, have achieved remarkable performance in multi-object tracking. However,the substantial computational resource consumption of these methods, coupled with the optimization challenges posed by dynamic data, results in less favorable inference speeds and training times. To address the aforementioned issues, this paper optimized the network architecture and proposed an effective training strategy to mitigate the problem of prolonged training times, thereby developing DecoderTracker, a novel end-to-end tracking method. Subsequently, to tackle the optimization challenges arising from dynamic data, this paper introduced DecoderTracker+ by incorporating a Fixed-Size Query Memory and refining certain attention layers. Our methods, without any bells and whistles, outperforms MOTR on multiple benchmarks, \textcolor{black}{featuring a 2 to 3 times faster inference than MOTR}, respectively. The proposed method is implemented in open-source code, accessible at https://github.com/liaopan-lp/MO-YOLO.</p></details> |  |

We present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), the first comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios. MFT25 establishes a robust foundation for advancing research in underwater tracking systems with important applications in marine biology, aquaculture monitoring, and ecological conservation.

While cooperative multi-user SLAM has demonstrated potential in leveraging distributed sensing, its application within multi-modal ISAC systems remains limited, particularly in terms of theoretical modeling and communication-layer integration. This paper proposes a novel multi-modal SLAM framework that addresses these limitations through three key contributions. First, a Bayesian estimation framework is developed for cooperative multi-user SLAM, along with a two-stage algorithm for robust radio map construction under dynamic and heterogeneous sensing conditions. Second, a multi-modal localization strategy is introduced, fusing SLAM results with camera-based multi-object tracking and inertial measurement unit (IMU) data via an error-aware model, significantly improving UE localization in multi-user scenarios. Third, a sensing-aided beam management scheme is proposed, utilizing global radio maps and localization data to generate UE-specific prior information for beam selection, thereby reducing inter-user interference and enhancing downlink spectral efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system improves radio map accuracy by up to 60%, enhances localization accuracy by 37.5%, and significantly outperforms traditional methods in both indoor and outdoor environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> |

Associating objects in low-frame-rate videos captured by moving unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in actual combat scenarios is complex due to rapid changes in object appearance and position within the frame. The task becomes even more challenging due to image degradation caused by cloud video streaming and compression algorithms. We present how instance association learning from single-frame annotations can overcome these challenges. We show that global features of the scene provide crucial context for low-FPS instance association, allowing our solution to be robust to distractors and gaps in detections. We also demonstrate that such a tracking approach maintains high association quality even when reducing the input image resolution and latent representation size for faster inference. Finally, we present a benchmark dataset of annotated military vehicles collected from publicly available data sources. This paper was initially presented at the NATO Science and Technology Organization Symposium (ICMCIS) organized by the Information Systems Technology (IST)Scientific and Technical Committee, IST-209-RSY - the ICMCIS, held in Oeiras, Portugal, 13-14 May 2025.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustifying 3D Perception through Least-Squares Multi-Agent Graphs Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04762v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The critical perception capabilities of EdgeAI systems, such as autonomous vehicles, are required to be resilient against adversarial threats, by enabling accurate identification and localization of multiple objects in the scene over time, mitigating their impact. Single-agent tracking offers resilience to adversarial attacks but lacks situational awareness, underscoring the need for multi-agent cooperation to enhance context understanding and robustness. This paper proposes a novel mitigation framework on 3D LiDAR scene against adversarial noise by tracking objects based on least-squares graph on multi-agent adversarial bounding boxes. Specifically, we employ the least-squares graph tool to reduce the induced positional error of each detection's centroid utilizing overlapped bounding boxes on a fully connected graph via differential coordinates and anchor points. Hence, the multi-vehicle detections are fused and refined mitigating the adversarial impact, and associated with existing tracks in two stages performing tracking to further suppress the adversarial threat. An extensive evaluation study on the real-world V2V4Real dataset demonstrates that the proposed method significantly outperforms both state-of-the-art single and multi-agent tracking frameworks by up to 23.3% under challenging adversarial conditions, operating as a resilient approach without relying on additional defense mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

It capitalises on the flexibilities offered by the integrated Gaussian process as a motion model and the convenient statistical properties of non-homogeneous Poisson processes as a suitable observation model. This can be combined with the proposed effective track revival / stitching mechanism. We accordingly introduce the two robust and adaptive trackers, Gaussian and Poisson Process with Classification (GaPP-Class) and GaPP with Revival and Classification (GaPP-ReaCtion). They employ an appropriate particle filtering inference scheme that efficiently integrates track management and hyperparameter learning (including the object class, if relevant). GaPP-ReaCtion extends GaPP-Class with the addition of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo kernel applied to each particle permitting track revival and stitching (e.g., within a few time steps after deleting a trajectory). Performance evaluation and benchmarking using synthetic and real data show that GaPP-Class and GaPP-ReaCtion outperform other state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. For example, GaPP-ReaCtion significantly reduces track breaks (e.g., by around 30% from real radar data and markedly more from simulated data).</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> |
| **[CrowdTrack: A Benchmark for Difficult Multiple Pedestrian Tracking in Real Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02479v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking is a classic field in computer vision. Among them, pedestrian tracking has extremely high application value and has become the most popular research category. Existing methods mainly use motion or appearance information for tracking, which is often difficult in complex scenarios. For the motion information, mutual occlusions between objects often prevent updating of the motion state; for the appearance information, non-robust results are often obtained due to reasons such as only partial visibility of the object or blurred images. Although learning how to perform tracking in these situations from the annotated data is the simplest solution, the existing MOT dataset fails to satisfy this solution. Existing methods mainly have two drawbacks: relatively simple scene composition and non-realistic scenarios. Although some of the video sequences in existing dataset do not have the above-mentioned drawbacks, the number is far from adequate for research purposes. To this end, we propose a difficult large-scale dataset for multi-pedestrian tracking, shot mainly from the first-person view and all from real-life complex scenarios. We name it ``CrowdTrack'' because there are numerous objects in most of the sequences. Our dataset consists of 33 videos, containing a total of 5,185 trajectories. Each object is annotated with a complete bounding box and a unique object ID. The dataset will provide a platform to facilitate the development of algorithms that remain effective in complex situations. We analyzed the dataset comprehensively and tested multiple SOTA models on our dataset. Besides, we analyzed the performance of the foundation models on our dataset. The dataset and project code is released at: https://github.com/loseevaya/CrowdTrack .</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Tuning Method for Real-time Multiple-Object Tracking Utilizing Thermal Sensor with Complexity Motion Pattern](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02408v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-Object Tracking in thermal images is essential for surveillance systems, particularly in challenging environments where RGB cameras struggle due to low visibility or poor lighting conditions. Thermal sensors enhance recognition tasks by capturing infrared signatures, but a major challenge is their low-level feature representation, which makes it difficult to accurately detect and track pedestrians. To address this, the paper introduces a novel tuning method for pedestrian tracking, specifically designed to handle the complex motion patterns in thermal imagery. The proposed framework optimizes two-stages, ensuring that each stage is tuned with the most suitable hyperparameters to maximize tracking performance. By fine-tuning hyperparameters for real-time tracking, the method achieves high accuracy without relying on complex reidentification or motion models. Extensive experiments on PBVS Thermal MOT dataset demonstrate that the approach is highly effective across various thermal camera conditions, making it a robust solution for real-world surveillance applications.</p></details> |  |

Although various weakly supervised methods and pseudo-labeling methods have been proposed to address these issues, they are mostly limited by domain-specific learning or rely solely on shape information from a single observation. In this paper, we propose a novel pseudo-labeling framework that uses only video data and is more robust to occlusion, without requiring a multi-view setup, additional sensors, camera poses, or domain-specific training. Specifically, we explore a technique for aggregating the pseudo-LiDARs of both static and dynamic objects across temporally adjacent frames using object point tracking, enabling 3D attribute extraction in scenarios where 3D data acquisition is infeasible. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method ensures reliable accuracy and strong scalability, making it a practical and effective solution for M3OD.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |

In this study, we explore the recently proposed State-Space Model, Mamba, leveraging its computational efficiency and capability for long-sequence modeling to effectively process dense image sequences in tracking tasks. First, we highlight the issue of temporal inconsistency in existing Mamba-based methods, specifically the failure to account for temporal continuity in the Mamba scanning mechanism. Secondly, building upon this insight,we propose TrackingMiM, a Mamba-in-Mamba architecture, a minimal-computation burden model for handling image sequence of tracking problem. In our framework, the mamba scan is performed in a nested way while independently process temporal and spatial coherent patch tokens. While the template frame is encoded as query token and utilized for tracking in every scan. Extensive experiments conducted on five UAV tracking benchmarks confirm that the proposed TrackingMiM achieves state-of-the-art precision while offering noticeable higher speed in UAV tracking.</p></details> | 12 pages |

Most of the existing approaches focus on learning target representation in well-conditioned daytime data, while for the unconstrained real-world scenarios with adverse weather conditions, e.g. nighttime or foggy environment, the tremendous domain shift leads to significant performance degradation. In this paper, we propose UMDATrack, which is capable of maintaining high-quality target state prediction under various adverse weather conditions within a unified domain adaptation framework. Specifically, we first use a controllable scenario generator to synthesize a small amount of unlabeled videos (less than 2% frames in source daytime datasets) in multiple weather conditions under the guidance of different text prompts. Afterwards, we design a simple yet effective domain-customized adapter (DCA), allowing the target objects' representation to rapidly adapt to various weather conditions without redundant model updating. Furthermore, to enhance the localization consistency between source and target domains, we propose a target-aware confidence alignment module (TCA) following optimal transport theorem. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMDATrack can surpass existing advanced visual trackers and lead new state-of-the-art performance by a significant margin.

This task has traditionally been framed as a template matching problem, evolving through major phases including correlation filters, two-stream networks, and one-stream networks with significant progress achieved. However, these methods typically require explicit classification and regression modeling, depend on supervised training with large-scale datasets, and are limited to the single task of tracking, lacking flexibility. In recent years, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly. Open-source models like Qwen2.5-VL, a flagship MLLMs with strong foundational capabilities, demonstrate excellent performance in grounding tasks. This has spurred interest in applying such models directly to visual tracking. However, experiments reveal that Qwen2.5-VL struggles with template matching between image pairs (i.e., tracking tasks). Inspired by deepseek-R1, we fine-tuned Qwen2.5-VL using the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning method on a small-scale dataset with a rule-based reward function. The resulting model, R1-Track, achieved notable performance on the GOT-10k benchmark. R1-Track supports flexible initialization via bounding boxes or text descriptions while retaining most of the original model's general capabilities. And we further discuss potential improvements for R1-Track. This rough technical report summarizes our findings as of May 2025.</p></details> | 7 pages, 2 figures |

However, existing approaches often struggle to learn reliable prompts due to limited exploitation of critical cues across frequency and temporal domains. In this paper, we propose a novel visual and memory dual adapter (VMDA) to construct more robust and discriminative representations for multi-modal tracking. Specifically, we develop a simple but effective visual adapter that adaptively transfers discriminative cues from auxiliary modality to dominant modality by jointly modeling the frequency, spatial, and channel-wise features. Additionally, we design the memory adapter inspired by the human memory mechanism, which stores global temporal cues and performs dynamic update and retrieval operations to ensure the consistent propagation of reliable temporal information across video sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the various multi-modal tracking tasks, including RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event tracking.

| **[Mamba-FETrack V2: Revisiting State Space Model for Frame-Event based Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23783v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combining traditional RGB cameras with bio-inspired event cameras for robust object tracking has garnered increasing attention in recent years. However, most existing multimodal tracking algorithms depend heavily on high-complexity Vision Transformer architectures for feature extraction and fusion across modalities. This not only leads to substantial computational overhead but also limits the effectiveness of cross-modal interactions. In this paper, we propose an efficient RGB-Event object tracking framework based on the linear-complexity Vision Mamba network, termed Mamba-FETrack V2. Specifically, we first design a lightweight Prompt Generator that utilizes embedded features from each modality, together with a shared prompt pool, to dynamically generate modality-specific learnable prompt vectors. These prompts, along with the modality-specific embedded features, are then fed into a Vision Mamba-based FEMamba backbone, which facilitates prompt-guided feature extraction, cross-modal interaction, and fusion in a unified manner. Finally, the fused representations are passed to the tracking head for accurate target localization. Extensive experimental evaluations on multiple RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, including short-term COESOT dataset and long-term datasets, i.e., FE108 and FELT V2, demonstrate the superior performance and efficiency of the proposed tracking framework.

| **[General Compression Framework for Efficient Transformer Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17564v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous works have attempted to improve tracking efficiency through lightweight architecture design or knowledge distillation from teacher models to compact student trackers. However, these solutions often sacrifice accuracy for speed to a great extent, and also have the problems of complex training process and structural limitations. Thus, we propose a general model compression framework for efficient transformer object tracking, named CompressTracker, to reduce model size while preserving tracking accuracy. Our approach features a novel stage division strategy that segments the transformer layers of the teacher model into distinct stages to break the limitation of model structure. Additionally, we also design a unique replacement training technique that randomly substitutes specific stages in the student model with those from the teacher model, as opposed to training the student model in isolation. Replacement training enhances the student model's ability to replicate the teacher model's behavior and simplifies the training process. To further forcing student model to emulate teacher model, we incorporate prediction guidance and stage-wise feature mimicking to provide additional supervision during the teacher model's compression process. CompressTracker is structurally agnostic, making it compatible with any transformer architecture. We conduct a series of experiment to verify the effectiveness and generalizability of our CompressTracker. Our CompressTracker-SUTrack, compressed from SUTrack, retains about 99 performance on LaSOT (72.2 AUC) while achieves 2.42x speed up.

| **[Tracking by Detection and Query: An Efficient End-to-End Framework for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06197v2)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) is dominated by two paradigms: tracking-by-detection (TBD) and tracking-by-query (TBQ). While TBD is decoupled and efficient, its fragmented association steps and heuristic matching pipelines often compromise robustness in complex scenarios. TBQ provides stronger semantic modeling through end-to-end learning, but suffers from high training cost and slow inference due to tight coupling between detection and association. To address these challenges, we propose TBDQ-Net, a unified tracking-by-detection-and-query (TBDQ) framework that effectively combines the strengths of both paradigms. Our method efficiently integrates pretrained, high-performance detectors with an MOT-tailored associator. The associator is lightweight and directly fetches information from the inference of detectors, enhancing the overall efficiency of the framework. The associator is also learnable, making it essential for fully end-to-end optimization, ensuring robust tracking capabilities. Specifically, the associator comprises two key modules: basic information interaction (BII) for comprehensive semantic interaction, and content-position alignment (CPA) for semantic and positional consistency. TBDQ-Net's effectiveness is extensively demonstrated on DanceTrack, SportsMOT and MOT20 benchmarks. As a structurally efficient and semantically robust tracking framework, it outperforms the leading TBD method by 6.0 IDF1 points on DanceTrack and achieves at least 37.5% faster inference than prominent TBQ methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562v1)** | 2025-06-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review for publication in IEEE Access</p></details> |

However, the study of the fundamental event data association problem is still in its infancy. In this paper, we propose a novel Event Data Association (called EDA) approach to explicitly address the event association and fusion problem. The proposed EDA seeks for event trajectories that best fit the event data, in order to perform unifying data association and information fusion. In EDA, we first asynchronously fuse the event data based on its information entropy. Then, we introduce a deterministic model hypothesis generation strategy, which effectively generates model hypotheses from the fused events, to represent the corresponding event trajectories. After that, we present a two-stage weighting algorithm, which robustly weighs and selects true models from the generated model hypotheses, through multi-structural geometric model fitting. Meanwhile, we also propose an adaptive model selection strategy to automatically determine the number of the true models. Finally, we use the selected true models to associate and fuse the event data, without being affected by sensor noise and irrelevant structures. We evaluate the performance of the proposed EDA on the object tracking task. The experimental results show the effectiveness of EDA under challenging scenarios, such as high speed, motion blur, and high dynamic range conditions.</p></details> | 32 pages, 7 figures |

To solve this, multimodal tracking (e.g., RGB-T models) aims to leverage complementary data such as thermal infrared features. While recent Vision Transformer-based multimodal trackers achieve strong performance, they are often computationally expensive due to large model sizes. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight RGB-T tracking algorithm based on Mobile Vision Transformers (MobileViT). Our tracker introduces a progressive fusion framework that jointly learns intra-modal and inter-modal interactions between the template and search regions using separable attention. This design produces effective feature representations that support more accurate target localization while achieving a small model size and fast inference speed. Compared to state-of-the-art efficient multimodal trackers, our model achieves comparable accuracy while offering significantly lower parameter counts (less than 4 million) and the fastest GPU inference speed of 122 frames per second. This paper is the first to propose a tracker using Mobile Vision Transformers for RGB-T tracking and multimodal tracking at large. Tracker code and model weights will be made publicly available upon acceptance.</p></details> |  |

Building on the FoundationPose architecture, we devise a novel binary search strategy combined with a render-and-compare mechanism to efficiently infer depth and generate robust pose hypotheses from true-scale CAD models. To maintain stable tracking in dynamic scenarios, including rapid movements and occlusions, RGBTrack integrates state-of-the-art 2D object tracking (XMem) with a Kalman filter and a state machine for proactive object pose recovery. In addition, RGBTrack's scale recovery module dynamically adapts CAD models of unknown scale using an initial depth estimate, enabling seamless integration with modern generative reconstruction techniques. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that RGBTrack's novel depth-free approach achieves competitive accuracy and real-time performance, making it a promising practical solution candidate for application areas including robotics, augmented reality, and computer vision.

To alleviate these problems, we introduce a novel representation, extended bounding field-of-view (eBFoV), for target localization and use it as the foundation of a general 360 tracking framework which is applicable for both omnidirectional visual object tracking and segmentation tasks. Building upon our previous work on omnidirectional visual object tracking (360VOT), we propose a comprehensive dataset and benchmark that incorporates a new component called omnidirectional video object segmentation (360VOS). The 360VOS dataset includes 290 sequences accompanied by dense pixel-wise masks and covers a broader range of target categories. To support both the development and evaluation of algorithms in this domain, we divide the dataset into a training subset with 170 sequences and a testing subset with 120 sequences. Furthermore, we tailor evaluation metrics for both omnidirectional tracking and segmentation to ensure rigorous assessment. Through extensive experiments, we benchmark state-of-the-art approaches and demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed 360 tracking framework and training dataset.

This stems from the fact that existing MLLMs are trained on images with limited diverse camera-object relations and corresponding textual descriptions. To address this, we propose a synthetic generation pipeline to create large-scale 3D visual instruction datasets. Our framework takes 3D assets as input and uses rendering and diffusion-based image generation models to create photorealistic images preserving precise camera-object relations. Additionally, large language models (LLMs) are used to generate text prompts for guiding visual instruction tuning and controlling image generation. We create Ultimate3D, a dataset of 240K VQAs with precise camera-object annotations, and corresponding benchmark. MLLMs fine-tuned on our proposed dataset outperform commercial models by a large margin, achieving an average accuracy improvement of 33.4% on camera-object relation recognition tasks. Our code, dataset, and benchmark will contribute to broad MLLM applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Exploration of Default Images in Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09166v3)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the creative practice of text-to-image generation (TTI), images are generated from text prompts. However, TTI models are trained to always yield an output, even if the prompt contains unknown terms. In this case, the model may generate what we call "default images": images that closely resemble each other across many unrelated prompts. We argue studying default images is valuable for designing better solutions for TTI and prompt engineering. In this paper, we provide the first investigation into default images on Midjourney, a popular image generator. We describe our systematic approach to create input prompts triggering default images, and present the results of our initial experiments and several small-scale ablation studies. We also report on a survey study investigating how default images affect user satisfaction. Our work lays the foundation for understanding default images in TTI and highlights challenges and future research directions.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Vision Foundation Models as Effective Visual Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08441v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the powerful representations of pre-trained vision foundation models -- traditionally used for visual comprehension -- we explore a novel direction: building an image tokenizer directly atop such models, a largely underexplored area. Specifically, we employ a frozen vision foundation model as the encoder of our tokenizer. To enhance its effectiveness, we introduce two key components: (1) a region-adaptive quantization framework that reduces redundancy in the pre-trained features on regular 2D grids, and (2) a semantic reconstruction objective that aligns the tokenizer's outputs with the foundation model's representations to preserve semantic fidelity. Based on these designs, our proposed image tokenizer, VFMTok, achieves substantial improvements in image reconstruction and generation quality, while also enhancing token efficiency. It further boosts autoregressive (AR) generation -- achieving a gFID of 2.07 on ImageNet benchmarks, while accelerating model convergence by three times, and enabling high-fidelity class-conditional synthesis without the need for classifier-free guidance (CFG). The code will be released publicly to benefit the community.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[FreeScale: Unleashing the Resolution of Diffusion Models via Tuning-Free Scale Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09626v2)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the accumulated errors. To tackle this challenge, we propose FreeScale, a tuning-free inference paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation via scale fusion. Specifically, FreeScale processes information from different receptive scales and then fuses it by extracting desired frequency components. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models. Notably, compared with previous best-performing methods, FreeScale unlocks the 8k-resolution text-to-image generation for the first time.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, Project Page: http://haonanqiu.com/projects/FreeScale.html, Code Repo: https://github.com/ali-vilab/FreeScale</p></details> |
| **[Hita: Holistic Tokenizer for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02358v4)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vanilla autoregressive image generation models generate visual tokens step-by-step, limiting their ability to capture holistic relationships among token sequences. Moreover, because most visual tokenizers map local image patches into latent tokens, global information is limited. To address this, we introduce \textit{Hita}, a novel image tokenizer for autoregressive (AR) image generation. It introduces a holistic-to-local tokenization scheme with learnable holistic queries and local patch tokens. Hita incorporates two key strategies to better align with the AR generation process: 1) {arranging} a sequential structure with holistic tokens at the beginning, followed by patch-level tokens, and using causal attention to maintain awareness of previous tokens; and 2) adopting a lightweight fusion module before feeding the de-quantized tokens into the decoder to control information flow and prioritize holistic tokens. Extensive experiments show that Hita accelerates the training speed of AR generators and outperforms those trained with vanilla tokenizers, achieving \textbf{2.59 FID} and \textbf{281.9 IS} on the ImageNet benchmark. Detailed analysis of the holistic representation highlights its ability to capture global image properties, such as textures, materials, and shapes. Additionally, Hita also demonstrates effectiveness in zero-shot style transfer and image in-painting.

| **[Subject-Consistent and Pose-Diverse Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08396v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-consistent generation (SCG)-aiming to maintain a consistent subject identity across diverse scenes-remains a challenge for text-to-image (T2I) models. Existing training-free SCG methods often achieve consistency at the cost of layout and pose diversity, hindering expressive visual storytelling. To address the limitation, we propose subject-Consistent and pose-Diverse T2I framework, dubbed as CoDi, that enables consistent subject generation with diverse pose and layout. Motivated by the progressive nature of diffusion, where coarse structures emerge early and fine details are refined later, CoDi adopts a two-stage strategy: Identity Transport (IT) and Identity Refinement (IR). IT operates in the early denoising steps, using optimal transport to transfer identity features to each target image in a pose-aware manner. This promotes subject consistency while preserving pose diversity. IR is applied in the later denoising steps, selecting the most salient identity features to further refine subject details. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results on subject consistency, pose diversity, and prompt fidelity demonstrate that CoDi achieves both better visual perception and stronger performance across all metrics. The code is provided in https://github.com/NJU-PCALab/CoDi.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Enhancement to Understanding: Build a Generalized Bridge for Low-light Vision via Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08380v1)** | 2025-07-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-level enhancement and high-level visual understanding in low-light vision have traditionally been treated separately. Low-light enhancement improves image quality for downstream tasks, but existing methods rely on physical or geometric priors, limiting generalization. Evaluation mainly focuses on visual quality rather than downstream performance. Low-light visual understanding, constrained by scarce labeled data, primarily uses task-specific domain adaptation, which lacks scalability. To address these challenges, we build a generalized bridge between low-light enhancement and low-light understanding, which we term Generalized Enhancement For Understanding (GEFU). This paradigm improves both generalization and scalability. To address the diverse causes of low-light degradation, we leverage pretrained generative diffusion models to optimize images, achieving zero-shot generalization performance. Building on this, we propose Semantically Consistent Unsupervised Fine-tuning (SCUF). Specifically, to overcome text prompt limitations, we introduce an illumination-aware image prompt to explicitly guide image generation and propose a cycle-attention adapter to maximize its semantic potential. To mitigate semantic degradation in unsupervised training, we propose caption and reflectance consistency to learn high-level semantics and image-level spatial semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in traditional image quality and GEFU tasks including classification, detection, and semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

They have been applied successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline. We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable interpretability to SAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, Mechanistic Interpretability for Vision at CVPR 2025</p></details> |

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) offers a promising solution by reducing the bitwidth of matrix operations. However, standard PTQ methods struggle with outliers, and achieving higher compression often requires transforming model weights and activations before quantization. In this work, we propose HadaNorm, a novel linear transformation that extends existing approaches by both normalizing channels activations and applying Hadamard transforms to effectively mitigate outliers and enable aggressive activation quantization. We demonstrate that HadaNorm consistently reduces quantization error across the various components of transformer blocks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 6 Figures |

However, the underlying computational redundancy involved in these steps has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the VAR inference process and identify two primary sources of inefficiency: step redundancy and unconditional branch redundancy. To address step redundancy, we propose an automatic step-skipping strategy that selectively omits unnecessary generation steps to improve efficiency. For unconditional branch redundancy, we observe that the information gap between the conditional and unconditional branches is minimal. Leveraging this insight, we introduce unconditional branch replacement, a technique that bypasses the unconditional branch to reduce computational cost. Notably, we observe that the effectiveness of acceleration strategies varies significantly across different samples. Motivated by this, we propose SkipVAR, a sample-adaptive framework that leverages frequency information to dynamically select the most suitable acceleration strategy for each instance. To evaluate the role of high-frequency information, we introduce high-variation benchmark datasets that test model sensitivity to fine details. Extensive experiments show SkipVAR achieves over 0.88 average SSIM with up to 1.81x overall acceleration and 2.62x speedup on the GenEval benchmark, maintaining model quality. These results confirm the effectiveness of frequency-aware, training-free adaptive acceleration for scalable autoregressive image generation.

| **[Concept Unlearning by Modeling Key Steps of Diffusion Process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06526v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs), represented by Stable Diffusion, which generate highly realistic images based on textual input, have been widely used. However, their misuse poses serious security risks. While existing concept unlearning methods aim to mitigate these risks, they struggle to balance unlearning effectiveness with generative retainability.To overcome this limitation, we innovatively propose the Key Step Concept Unlearning (KSCU) method, which ingeniously capitalizes on the unique stepwise sampling characteristic inherent in diffusion models during the image generation process. Unlike conventional approaches that treat all denoising steps equally, KSCU strategically focuses on pivotal steps with the most influence over the final outcome by dividing key steps for different concept unlearning tasks and fine-tuning the model only at those steps. This targeted approach reduces the number of parameter updates needed for effective unlearning, while maximizing the retention of the model's generative capabilities.Through extensive benchmark experiments, we demonstrate that KSCU effectively prevents T2I DMs from generating undesirable images while better retaining the model's generative capabilities. Our code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing methods that focus on isolated parts of 3D hair modeling and involve a heavy computation process or network training, Digital Salon offers a holistic and interactive system that lowers the technical barriers of 3D hair modeling through natural language-based interaction. The system guides users through four key stages: text-guided hair retrieval, real-time hair simulation, interactive hair refinement, and hair-conditioned image generation. This cohesive workflow makes advanced hair design accessible to users of varying skill levels and dramatically streamlines the creative process in digital media with an intuitive, versatile, and efficient solution for hair modeling. User studies show that our system can outperform traditional hair modeling workflows for rapid prototyping.

| **[Localized Concept Erasure for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Using Training-Free Gated Low-Rank Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12356v3)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning based concept erasing has demonstrated promising results in preventing generation of harmful contents from text-to-image diffusion models by removing target concepts while preserving remaining concepts. To maintain the generation capability of diffusion models after concept erasure, it is necessary to remove only the image region containing the target concept when it locally appears in an image, leaving other regions intact. However, prior arts often compromise fidelity of the other image regions in order to erase the localized target concept appearing in a specific area, thereby reducing the overall performance of image generation. To address these limitations, we first introduce a framework called localized concept erasure, which allows for the deletion of only the specific area containing the target concept in the image while preserving the other regions. As a solution for the localized concept erasure, we propose a training-free approach, dubbed Gated Low-rank adaptation for Concept Erasure (GLoCE), that injects a lightweight module into the diffusion model. GLoCE consists of low-rank matrices and a simple gate, determined only by several generation steps for concepts without training. By directly applying GLoCE to image embeddings and designing the gate to activate only for target concepts, GLoCE can selectively remove only the region of the target concepts, even when target and remaining concepts coexist within an image. Extensive experiments demonstrated GLoCE not only improves the image fidelity to text prompts after erasing the localized target concepts, but also outperforms prior arts in efficacy, specificity, and robustness by large margin and can be extended to mass concept erasure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVPR 2025</p></details> |

However, autonomous driving is a data-driven task. Complete panoramic data acquisition requires complex sampling systems and annotation pipelines, which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Although existing street view generation models have demonstrated strong data regeneration capabilities, they can only learn from the fixed data distribution of existing datasets and cannot achieve high-quality, controllable panoramic generation. In this paper, we propose the first panoramic generation method Percep360 for autonomous driving. Percep360 enables coherent generation of panoramic data with control signals based on the stitched panoramic data. Percep360 focuses on two key aspects: coherence and controllability. Specifically, to overcome the inherent information loss caused by the pinhole sampling process, we propose the Local Scenes Diffusion Method (LSDM). LSDM reformulates the panorama generation as a spatially continuous diffusion process, bridging the gaps between different data distributions. Additionally, to achieve the controllable generation of panoramic images, we propose a Probabilistic Prompting Method (PPM). PPM dynamically selects the most relevant control cues, enabling controllable panoramic image generation. We evaluate the effectiveness of the generated images from three perspectives: image quality assessment (i.e., no-reference and with reference), controllability, and their utility in real-world Bird's Eye View (BEV) segmentation. Notably, the generated data consistently outperforms the original stitched images in no-reference quality metrics and enhances downstream perception models.

In most previous works, LoRA weight matrices are randomly initialized with a fixed rank across all attachment points. In this paper, we improve convergence and final performance of LoRA fine-tuning, using our proposed data-driven weight initialization method, ConsNoTrainLoRA (CNTLoRA). We express LoRA initialization as a domain shift problem where we use multiple constraints relating the pre-training and fine-tuning activations. By reformulating these constraints, we obtain a closed-form estimate of LoRA weights that depends on pre-training weights and fine-tuning activation vectors and hence requires no training during initialization. This weight estimate is decomposed to initialize the up and down matrices with proposed flexibility of variable ranks. With the proposed initialization method, we fine-tune on downstream tasks such as image generation, image classification and image understanding. Both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that CNTLoRA outperforms standard and data-driven weight initialization methods. Extensive analyses and ablations further elucidate the design choices of our framework, providing an optimal recipe for faster convergence and enhanced performance.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

While often regarded as unpredictable artifacts, we argue that these failures reflect deeper, structured misalignments within the generative process. In this work, we propose a cognitively inspired perspective that reinterprets hallucinations as trajectory drift within a latent alignment space. Empirical observations reveal that generation unfolds within a multiaxial cognitive tension field, where the model must continuously negotiate competing demands across three key critical axes: semantic coherence, structural alignment, and knowledge grounding. We then formalize this three-axis space as the \textbf{Hallucination Tri-Space} and introduce the Alignment Risk Code (ARC): a dynamic vector representation that quantifies real-time alignment tension during generation. The magnitude of ARC captures overall misalignment, its direction identifies the dominant failure axis, and its imbalance reflects tension asymmetry. Based on this formulation, we develop the TensionModulator (TM-ARC): a lightweight controller that operates entirely in latent space. TM-ARC monitors ARC signals and applies targeted, axis-specific interventions during the sampling process. Extensive experiments on standard T2I benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces hallucination without compromising image quality or diversity. This framework offers a unified and interpretable approach for understanding and mitigating generative failures in diffusion-based T2I systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>We wi...</summary><p>We withdraw this paper due to significant visualization errors in Figure 3 and 5 that affect the correctness of our core modeling claims and may cause misinterpretation.

The impressive capabilities of large-scale neural networks suggest that the answer to this question is yes. However, even for the most capable models, there are still frequent failure cases that raise doubts about their compositionality. Here, we seek to understand what it takes for a standard neural network to generalize over tasks that share compositional structure. We find that simply scaling data and model size leads to compositional generalization. We show that this holds across different task encodings as long as the training distribution sufficiently covers the task space. In line with this finding, we prove that standard multilayer perceptrons can approximate a general class of compositional task families to arbitrary precision using only a linear number of neurons with respect to the number of task modules. Finally, we uncover that if networks successfully compositionally generalize, the constituents of a task can be linearly decoded from their hidden activations. We show that this metric correlates with failures of text-to-image generation models to compose known concepts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/smonsays/scale-compositionality</p></details> |

Recent automated T2I evaluation methods leverage pre-trained vision-language models to measure cross-modal alignment. However, our preliminary study reveals that they are still limited in assessing rich entity-attribute semantics, facing challenges in attribute confusion, i.e., when attributes are correctly depicted but associated to the wrong entities. To address this, we build on a Visual Question Answering (VQA) localization strategy targeting one single entity at a time across both visual and textual modalities. We propose a localized human evaluation protocol and introduce a novel automatic metric, Localized VQAScore (L-VQAScore), that combines visual localization with VQA probing both correct (reflection) and miss-localized (leakage) attribute generation. On a newly curated dataset featuring challenging compositional alignment scenarios, L-VQAScore outperforms state-of-the-art T2I evaluation methods in terms of correlation with human judgments, demonstrating its strength in capturing fine-grained entity-attribute associations. We believe L-VQAScore can be a reliable and scalable alternative to subjective evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICIAP25.

A transformer-based EEG encoder maps brain activity to these captions through contrastive learning. During inference, caption embeddings retrieved via projection heads condition a pretrained latent diffusion model for image generation. This text-mediated framework yields state-of-the-art visual decoding on the EEGCVPR dataset, with interpretable alignment to known neurocognitive pathways.

Although existing methods achieve high-fidelity identity preservation, they often struggle with limited multi-ID usability and inadequate facial editability. We present DynamicID, a tuning-free framework supported by a dual-stage training paradigm that inherently facilitates both single-ID and multi-ID personalized generation with high fidelity and flexible facial editability. Our key innovations include: 1) Semantic-Activated Attention (SAA), which employs query-level activation gating to minimize disruption to the original model when injecting ID features and achieve multi-ID personalization without requiring multi-ID samples during training. 2) Identity-Motion Reconfigurator (IMR), which leverages contrastive learning to effectively disentangle and re-entangle facial motion and identity features, thereby enabling flexible facial editing. Additionally, we have developed a curated VariFace-10k facial dataset, comprising 10k unique individuals, each represented by 35 distinct facial images. Experimental results demonstrate that DynamicID outperforms state-of-the-art methods in identity fidelity, facial editability, and multi-ID personalization capability.</p></details> | ICCV 2025 |

Existing attribution methods identify training examples influencing an entire image, but fall short in isolating contributions to specific elements, such as styles or objects, that matter most to stakeholders. To bridge this gap, we introduce \emph{concept-level attribution} via a novel method called \emph{Concept-TRAK}. Concept-TRAK extends influence functions with two key innovations: (1) a reformulated diffusion training loss based on diffusion posterior sampling, enabling robust, sample-specific attribution; and (2) a concept-aware reward function that emphasizes semantic relevance. We evaluate Concept-TRAK on the AbC benchmark, showing substantial improvements over prior methods. Through diverse case studies--ranging from identifying IP-protected and unsafe content to analyzing prompt engineering and compositional learning--we demonstrate how concept-level attribution yields actionable insights for responsible generative AI development and governance.</p></details> | Preprint |

In this paper, we identify imbalanced activation distributions as a primary source of quantization difficulty, and propose to adjust these distributions through weight finetuning to be more quantization-friendly. We provide both theoretical and empirical evidence supporting finetuning as a practical and reliable solution. Building on this approach, we further distinguish two critical types of quantized layers: those responsible for retaining essential temporal information and those particularly sensitive to bit-width reduction. By selectively finetuning these layers under both local and global supervision, we mitigate performance degradation while enhancing quantization efficiency. Our method demonstrates its efficacy across three high-resolution image generation tasks, obtaining state-of-the-art performance across multiple bit-width settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However, their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning (MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

| **[FedPhD: Federated Pruning with Hierarchical Learning of Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06449v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed learning paradigm, trains models over distributed clients' data. FL is particularly beneficial for distributed training of Diffusion Models (DMs), which are high-quality image generators that require diverse data. However, challenges such as high communication costs and data heterogeneity persist in training DMs similar to training Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks. Limited research has addressed these issues in FL environments. To address this gap and challenges, we introduce a novel approach, FedPhD, designed to efficiently train DMs in FL environments. FedPhD leverages Hierarchical FL with homogeneity-aware model aggregation and selection policy to tackle data heterogeneity while reducing communication costs. The distributed structured pruning of FedPhD enhances computational efficiency and reduces model storage requirements in clients. Our experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that FedPhD achieves high model performance regarding Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores while reducing communication costs by up to $88\%$. FedPhD outperforms baseline methods achieving at least a $34\%$ improvement in FID, while utilizing only $56\%$ of the total computation and communication resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

X-ray image segmentation is an essential step for many computer-aided diagnostic systems, yet it remains challenging. Deep-learning-based methods have achieved superior performance in medical image segmentation tasks but often require a large amount of high-quality annotated data for model training. Providing such an annotated dataset is not only time-consuming but also requires a high level of expertise. This is particularly challenging in wrist bone segmentation in X-rays, due to the interposition of multiple small carpal bones in the image. To overcome the data annotation issue, this work utilizes a large number of simulated X-ray images generated from Computed Tomography (CT) volumes with their corresponding 10 bone labels to train a deep learning-based model for wrist bone segmentation in real X-ray images. The proposed method was evaluated using both simulated images and real images. The method achieved Dice scores ranging from 0.80 to 0.92 for the simulated dataset generated from different view angles. Qualitative analysis of the segmentation results of the real X-ray images also demonstrated the superior performance of the trained model. The trained model and X-ray simulation code are freely available for research purposes: the link will be provided upon acceptance.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[StreamDiffusion: A Pipeline-level Solution for Real-time Interactive Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12491v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce StreamDiffusion, a real-time diffusion pipeline designed for interactive image generation. Existing diffusion models are adept at creating images from text or image prompts, yet they often fall short in real-time interaction. This limitation becomes particularly evident in scenarios involving continuous input, such as Metaverse, live video streaming, and broadcasting, where high throughput is imperative. To address this, we present a novel approach that transforms the original sequential denoising into the batching denoising process. Stream Batch eliminates the conventional wait-and-interact approach and enables fluid and high throughput streams. To handle the frequency disparity between data input and model throughput, we design a novel input-output queue for parallelizing the streaming process. Moreover, the existing diffusion pipeline uses classifier-free guidance(CFG), which requires additional U-Net computation. To mitigate the redundant computations, we propose a novel residual classifier-free guidance (RCFG) algorithm that reduces the number of negative conditional denoising steps to only one or even zero. Besides, we introduce a stochastic similarity filter(SSF) to optimize power consumption. Our Stream Batch achieves around 1.5x speedup compared to the sequential denoising method at different denoising levels. The proposed RCFG leads to speeds up to 2.05x higher than the conventional CFG. Combining the proposed strategies and existing mature acceleration tools makes the image-to-image generation achieve up-to 91.07fps on one RTX4090, improving the throughputs of AutoPipline developed by Diffusers over 59.56x. Furthermore, our proposed StreamDiffusion also significantly reduces the energy consumption by 2.39x on one RTX3060 and 1.99x on one RTX4090, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>tech ...</summary><p>tech report, the code is available at https://github.com/cumulo-autumn/StreamDiffusion</p></details> |
| **[NeoBabel: A Multilingual Open Tower for Visual Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06137v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation advancements have been predominantly English-centric, creating barriers for non-English speakers and perpetuating digital inequities. While existing systems rely on translation pipelines, these introduce semantic drift, computational overhead, and cultural misalignment. We introduce NeoBabel, a novel multilingual image generation framework that sets a new Pareto frontier in performance, efficiency and inclusivity, supporting six languages: English, Chinese, Dutch, French, Hindi, and Persian. The model is trained using a combination of large-scale multilingual pretraining and high-resolution instruction tuning. To evaluate its capabilities, we expand two English-only benchmarks to multilingual equivalents: m-GenEval and m-DPG. NeoBabel achieves state-of-the-art multilingual performance while retaining strong English capability, scoring 0.75 on m-GenEval and 0.68 on m-DPG. Notably, it performs on par with leading models on English tasks while outperforming them by +0.11 and +0.09 on multilingual benchmarks, even though these models are built on multilingual base LLMs. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our targeted alignment training for preserving and extending crosslingual generalization. We further introduce two new metrics to rigorously assess multilingual alignment and robustness to code-mixed prompts. Notably, NeoBabel matches or exceeds English-only models while being 2-4x smaller. We release an open toolkit, including all code, model checkpoints, a curated dataset of 124M multilingual text-image pairs, and standardized multilingual evaluation protocols, to advance inclusive AI research. Our work demonstrates that multilingual capability is not a trade-off but a catalyst for improved robustness, efficiency, and cultural fidelity in generative AI.</p></details> | 34 pages, 12 figures |
| **[RichControl: Structure- and Appearance-Rich Training-Free Spatial Control for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02792v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have shown remarkable success in generating high-quality images from text prompts. Recent efforts extend these models to incorporate conditional images (e.g., depth or pose maps) for fine-grained spatial control. Among them, feature injection methods have emerged as a training-free alternative to traditional fine-tuning approaches. However, they often suffer from structural misalignment, condition leakage, and visual artifacts, especially when the condition image diverges significantly from natural RGB distributions. By revisiting existing methods, we identify a core limitation: the synchronous injection of condition features fails to account for the trade-off between domain alignment and structural preservation during denoising. Inspired by this observation, we propose a flexible feature injection framework that decouples the injection timestep from the denoising process. At its core is a structure-rich injection module, which enables the model to better adapt to the evolving interplay between alignment and structure preservation throughout the diffusion steps, resulting in more faithful structural generation. In addition, we introduce appearance-rich prompting and a restart refinement strategy to further enhance appearance control and visual quality. Together, these designs enable training-free generation that is both structure-rich and appearance-rich. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse zero-shot conditioning scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.07540 by other authors</p></details> |
| **[TDRI: Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation for Interactive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17669v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although text-to-image generation technologies have made significant advancements, they still face challenges when dealing with ambiguous prompts and aligning outputs with user intent.Our proposed framework, TDRI (Two-Phase Dialogue Refinement and Co-Adaptation), addresses these issues by enhancing image generation through iterative user interaction. It consists of two phases: the Initial Generation Phase, which creates base images based on user prompts, and the Interactive Refinement Phase, which integrates user feedback through three key modules. The Dialogue-to-Prompt (D2P) module ensures that user feedback is effectively transformed into actionable prompts, which improves the alignment between user intent and model input. By evaluating generated outputs against user expectations, the Feedback-Reflection (FR) module identifies discrepancies and facilitates improvements. In an effort to ensure consistently high-quality results, the Adaptive Optimization (AO) module fine-tunes the generation process by balancing user preferences and maintaining prompt fidelity. Experimental results show that TDRI outperforms existing methods by achieving 33.6% human preference, compared to 6.2% for GPT-4 augmentation, and the highest CLIP and BLIP alignment scores (0.338 and 0.336, respectively). In iterative feedback tasks, user satisfaction increased to 88% after 8 rounds, with diminishing returns beyond 6 rounds. Furthermore, TDRI has been found to reduce the number of iterations and improve personalization in the creation of fashion products. TDRI exhibits a strong potential for a wide range of applications in the creative and industrial domains, as it streamlines the creative process and improves alignment with user preferences</p></details> |  |
