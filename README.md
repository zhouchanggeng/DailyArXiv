| **[Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07629v3)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.</p></details> |  |
| **[ARM: A Learnable, Plug-and-Play Module for CLIP-based Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24224v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVSS) is fundamentally hampered by the coarse, image-level representations of CLIP, which lack precise pixel-level details. Existing training-free methods attempt to resolve this by either importing priors from costly external foundation models (e.g., SAM, DINO) or by applying static, hand-crafted heuristics to CLIP's internal features. These approaches are either computationally expensive or sub-optimal. We propose the Attention Refinement Module (ARM), a lightweight, learnable module that effectively unlocks and refines CLIP's internal potential. Unlike static-fusion methods, ARM learns to adaptively fuse hierarchical features. It employs a semantically-guided cross-attention block, using robust deep features (K, V) to select and refine detail-rich shallow features (Q), followed by a self-attention block. The key innovation lies in a ``train once, use anywhere" paradigm. Trained once on a general-purpose dataset (e.g., COCO-Stuff), ARM acts as a universal plug-and-play post-processor for diverse training-free frameworks. Extensive experiments show that ARM consistently boosts baseline performance on multiple benchmarks with negligible inference overhead, establishing an efficient and effective paradigm for training-free OVSS.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Clipped Gradient Methods for Nonsmooth Convex Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: A Refined Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23178v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\frak p}$-th moment where ${\frak p}\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\frak l}^{\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\frak l}\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\in\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}d_{\rm eff}^{-1/2{\frak p}}\ln^{1-1/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{1/{\frak p}-1})$ and ${\cal O}(σ_{\frak l}^2d_{\rm eff}^{-1/{\frak p}}\ln^{2-2/{\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{2/{\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\rm eff}\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part of this work is in submission</p></details> |

We propose CLIP-Joint-Detect, a simple and detector-agnostic framework that integrates CLIP-style contrastive vision-language supervision through end-to-end joint training. A lightweight parallel head projects region or grid features into the CLIP embedding space and aligns them with learnable class-specific text embeddings via InfoNCE contrastive loss and an auxiliary cross-entropy term, while all standard detection losses are optimized simultaneously. The approach applies seamlessly to both two-stage and one-stage architectures. We validate it on Pascal VOC 2007+2012 using Faster R-CNN and on the large-scale MS COCO 2017 benchmark using modern YOLO detectors (YOLOv11), achieving consistent and substantial improvements while preserving real-time inference speed. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that joint optimization with learnable text embeddings markedly enhances closed-set detection performance across diverse architectures and datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures.

| **[CLIP Based Region-Aware Feature Fusion for Automated BBPS Scoring in Colonoscopy Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20374v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate assessment of bowel cleanliness is essential for effective colonoscopy procedures. The Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) offers a standardized scoring system but suffers from subjectivity and inter-observer variability when performed manually. In this paper, to support robust training and evaluation, we construct a high-quality colonoscopy dataset comprising 2,240 images from 517 subjects, annotated with expert-agreed BBPS scores. We propose a novel automated BBPS scoring framework that leverages the CLIP model with adapter-based transfer learning and a dedicated fecal-feature extraction branch. Our method fuses global visual features with stool-related textual priors to improve the accuracy of bowel cleanliness evaluation without requiring explicit segmentation. Extensive experiments on both our dataset and the public NERTHU dataset demonstrate the superiority of our approach over existing baselines, highlighting its potential for clinical deployment in computer-aided colonoscopy analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 9 figures, BMVC 2025 submission</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Cosine Similarity Magnitude-Aware CLIP for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09948v2)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts have repurposed the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model for No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) by measuring the cosine similarity between the image embedding and textual prompts such as "a good photo" or "a bad photo." However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPECIAL: Zero-shot Hyperspectral Image Classification With CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16222v3)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification aims to categorize each pixel in an HSI into a specific land cover class, which is crucial for applications such as remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and agriculture. Although deep learning-based HSI classification methods have achieved significant advancements, existing methods still rely on manually labeled data for training, which is both time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel zero-shot hyperspectral image classification framework based on CLIP (SPECIAL), aiming to eliminate the need for manual annotations. The SPECIAL framework consists of two main stages: (1) CLIP-based pseudo-label generation, and (2) noisy label learning. In the first stage, HSI is spectrally interpolated to produce RGB bands. These bands are subsequently classified using CLIP, resulting in noisy pseudo-labels that are accompanied by confidence scores. To improve the quality of these labels, we propose a scaling strategy that fuses predictions from multiple spatial scales. In the second stage, spectral information and a label refinement technique are incorporated to mitigate label noise and further enhance classification accuracy. Experimental results on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SPECIAL outperforms existing methods in zero-shot HSI classification, showing its potential for more practical applications. The code is available at https://github.com/LiPang/SPECIAL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond CLIP: Knowledge-Enhanced Multimodal Transformers for Cross-Modal Alignment in Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19663v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of preventable blindness worldwide, demanding accurate automated diagnostic systems. While general-domain vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) perform well on natural image tasks, they struggle in medical domain applications, particularly in cross-modal retrieval for ophthalmological images. We propose a novel knowledge-enhanced joint embedding framework that integrates retinal fundus images, clinical text, and structured patient data through a multimodal transformer architecture to address the critical gap in medical image-text alignment. Our approach employs separate encoders for each modality: a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) for retinal images, Bio-ClinicalBERT for clinical narratives, and a multilayer perceptron for structured demographic and clinical features. These modalities are fused through a joint transformer with modality-specific embeddings, trained using multiple objectives including contrastive losses between modality pairs, reconstruction losses for images and text, and classification losses for DR severity grading according to ICDR and SDRG schemes. Experimental results on the Brazilian Multilabel Ophthalmological Dataset (BRSET) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline models. Our framework achieves near-perfect text-to-image retrieval performance with Recall@1 of 99.94% compared to fine-tuned CLIP's 1.29%, while maintaining state-of-the-art classification accuracy of 97.05% for SDRG and 97.97% for ICDR. Furthermore, zero-shot evaluation on the unseen DeepEyeNet dataset validates strong generalizability with 93.95% Recall@1 versus 0.22% for fine-tuned CLIP. These results demonstrate that our multimodal training approach effectively captures cross-modal relationships in the medical domain, establishing both superior retrieval capabilities and robust diagnostic performance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Exploration vs Exploitation: Rethinking RLVR through Clipping, Entropy, and Spurious Reward](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16912v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the exploration-exploitation trade-off in reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a framework for improving the reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies suggest that RLVR can elicit strong mathematical reasoning in LLMs through two seemingly paradoxical mechanisms: spurious rewards, which suppress exploitation by rewarding outcomes unrelated to the ground truth, and entropy minimization, which suppresses exploration by pushing the model toward more confident and deterministic outputs, highlighting a puzzling dynamic: both discouraging exploitation and discouraging exploration improve reasoning performance, yet the underlying principles that reconcile these effects remain poorly understood. We focus on two fundamental questions: (i) how policy entropy relates to performance, and (ii) whether spurious rewards yield gains, potentially through the interplay of clipping bias and model contamination. Our results show that clipping bias under spurious rewards reduces policy entropy, leading to more confident and deterministic outputs, while entropy minimization alone is insufficient for improvement. We further propose a reward-misalignment model explaining why spurious rewards can enhance performance beyond contaminated settings. Our findings clarify the mechanisms behind spurious-reward benefits and provide principles for more effective RLVR training.</p></details> | 35 pages |
| **[SSR: Semantic and Spatial Rectification for CLIP-based Weakly Supervised Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01701v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has been widely applied to Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) tasks due to its powerful cross-modal semantic understanding capabilities. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Spatial Rectification (SSR) method to address the limitations of existing CLIP-based weakly supervised semantic segmentation approaches: over-activation in non-target foreground regions and background areas. Specifically, at the semantic level, the Cross-Modal Prototype Alignment (CMPA) establishes a contrastive learning mechanism to enforce feature space alignment across modalities, reducing inter-class overlap while enhancing semantic correlations, to rectify over-activation in non-target foreground regions effectively; at the spatial level, the Superpixel-Guided Correction (SGC) leverages superpixel-based spatial priors to precisely filter out interference from non-target regions during affinity propagation, significantly rectifying background over-activation. Extensive experiments on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms all single-stage approaches, as well as more complex multi-stage approaches, achieving mIoU scores of 79.5% and 50.6%, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[On the dynamic evolution of CLIP texture-shape bias and its relationship to human alignment and model robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09814v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive language-image models such as CLIP have demonstrated remarkable generalization capabilities. However, how their internal visual representations evolve during training and how this evolution relates to human perception remains poorly understood. Most existing analysis characterize fully trained models, leaving the dynamics of representational biases and perceptual alignment largely unexplored. In this work, we present an epoch-by-epoch analysis of CLIP models throughout training, focusing on the evolution of texture-shape bias, alignment with human perceptual judgements, and sensitivity to image noise. Using multiple perceptual benchmarks spanning low-level image quality assessment, mid-level perceptual similarity, saliency correspondence, and noisy robustness, we identify a consistent, training-stage-dependent representational transition. Early training stages exhibit strong texture bias, elevated alignment with low-level human perceptual measures, and increased sensitivity to Gaussian noise perturbations. As training progresses, this texture bias gradually diminishes in favor of more shape-based representations, coinciding with improved robustness to noise and a decline in low-level perceptual alignment. Importantly, these dynamics are consistently observed across multiple CLIP model scales, indicating that the phenomenon is not specific to a particular architecture size. Our findings provide an empirical characterization of how perceptual alignment, feature bias, and robustness co-evolve during multimodal model training. This work reveals a systematic trade-off between early low-level perceptual alignment and later robustness, offering new insights into the representational dynamics of vision-language models and their relationship to human visual processing.</p></details> |  |
| **[ABE-CLIP: Training-Free Attribute Binding Enhancement for Compositional Image-Text Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17178v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) has achieved remarkable performance in various multimodal tasks. However, it still struggles with compositional image-text matching, particularly in accurately associating objects with their corresponding attributes, because its inherent global representation often overlooks fine-grained semantics for attribute binding. Existing methods often require additional training or extensive hard negative sampling, yet they frequently show limited generalization to novel compositional concepts and fail to fundamentally address the drawbacks of global representations. In this paper, we propose ABE-CLIP, a novel training-free Attribute Binding Enhancement method designed to strengthen attribute-object binding in CLIP-like models. Specifically, we employ a Semantic Refinement Mechanism to refine token embeddings for both object and attribute phrases in the text, thereby mitigating attribute confusion and improving semantic precision. We further introduce a Local Token-Patch Alignment strategy that computes similarity scores between refined textual tokens and their most relevant image patches. By aggregating localized similarity scores, ABE-CLIP computes the final image-text similarity. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that ABE-CLIP significantly improves attribute-object binding performance, even surpassing methods that require extensive training.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Continual Learning on CLIP via Incremental Prompt Tuning with Intrinsic Textual Anchors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20680v3)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR.

| **[The Effect of Negation on CLIP in Medical Imaging: Limitations of Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17121v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models like CLIP are increasingly used in medical imaging tasks due to their ability to align images and text without the need for extensive labeled data. This makes them particularly useful for applications like image retrieval, report generation, and classification in clinical settings. A potential issue to this approach is that CLIP-based models often under perform when interpreting negated phrases, which is especially problematic in the context of medical diagnosing. In this study, we evaluate the Stanford AIMI CheXagent model on its ability to correctly retrieve chest X-ray images using prompts with and without negation. The goal of this project is to understand where this model fails and then use it as a base model to improve its retrieval accuracy by fine tuning methods outlined in previous work. Results from this study show improvement in handling of negation in the CLIP model with a slight decrease in accuracy of positive prompt evaluation. Alongside retrieval accuracy, we examined internal model behavior through token attribution, t-SNE projection, and attention-head ablation to better characterize how each fine tuning approach reshaped the text encoders representation of negated clinical language. Through this work, we hope to better understand the internal behavior of CLIP and improve its handling of negation using clinically relevant language for improving its reliability in medical AI devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, submitted to WACV Pixels to Patients Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Non-Asymptotic Global Convergence of PPO-Clip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16565v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained attention for aligning large language models (LLMs) via reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The actor-only variants of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) are widely applied for their efficiency. These algorithms incorporate a clipping mechanism to improve stability. Besides, a regularization term, such as the reverse KL-divergence or a more general \(f\)-divergence, is introduced to prevent policy drift. Despite their empirical success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the problem and the algorithm's properties is limited. This paper advances the theoretical foundations of the PPO-Clip algorithm by analyzing a deterministic actor-only PPO algorithm within the general RL setting with \(f\)-divergence regularization under the softmax policy parameterization. We derive a non-uniform Lipschitz smoothness condition and a Łojasiewicz inequality for the considered problem. Based on these, a non-asymptotic linear convergence rate to the globally optimal policy is established for the forward KL-regularizer. Furthermore, stationary convergence and local linear convergence are derived for the reverse KL-regularizer.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Frames to Clips: Training-free Adaptive Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on various vision-language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames, which quickly exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions mitigate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics in long-form videos, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work, we systematically examine the role of temporal information and show that extending selection from isolated key frames to temporally coherent key clips improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we introduce frame resolution as a controllable factor in frame selection, enabling a trade-off between spatial resolution and clip length. Building on this idea, we propose an adaptive clip length module that dynamically balances these factors to ensure a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling by up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench, and MLVU, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling VLMs to real-world video understanding applications.

| **[AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26569v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ostadabbas/AdSum204.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 32nd International Conference on MultiMedia Modeling</p></details> |
| **[CLIP-FTI: Fine-Grained Face Template Inversion via CLIP-Driven Attribute Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15433v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Face recognition systems store face templates for efficient matching. Once leaked, these templates pose a threat: inverting them can yield photorealistic surrogates that compromise privacy and enable impersonation. Although existing research has achieved relatively realistic face template inversion, the reconstructed facial images exhibit over-smoothed facial-part attributes (eyes, nose, mouth) and limited transferability. To address this problem, we present CLIP-FTI, a CLIP-driven fine-grained attribute conditioning framework for face template inversion. Our core idea is to use the CLIP model to obtain the semantic embeddings of facial features, in order to realize the reconstruction of specific facial feature attributes. Specifically, facial feature attribute embeddings extracted from CLIP are fused with the leaked template via a cross-modal feature interaction network and projected into the intermediate latent space of a pretrained StyleGAN. The StyleGAN generator then synthesizes face images with the same identity as the templates but with more fine-grained facial feature attributes. Experiments across multiple face recognition backbones and datasets show that our reconstructions (i) achieve higher identification accuracy and attribute similarity, (ii) recover sharper component-level attribute semantics, and (iii) improve cross-model attack transferability compared to prior reconstruction attacks. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first method to use additional information besides the face template attack to realize face template inversion and obtains SOTA results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Bias-Variance Trade-off for Clipped Stochastic First-Order Methods: From Bounded Variance to Infinite Mean](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14686v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic optimization is fundamental to modern machine learning. Recent research has extended the study of stochastic first-order methods (SFOMs) from light-tailed to heavy-tailed noise, which frequently arises in practice, with clipping emerging as a key technique for controlling heavy-tailed gradients. Extensive theoretical advances have further shown that the oracle complexity of SFOMs depends on the tail index $α$ of the noise. Nonetheless, existing complexity results often cover only the case $α\in (1,2]$, that is, the regime where the noise has a finite mean, while the complexity bounds tend to infinity as $α$ approaches $1$. This paper tackles the general case of noise with tail index $α\in(0,2]$, covering regimes ranging from noise with bounded variance to noise with an infinite mean, where the latter case has been scarcely studied. Through a novel analysis of the bias-variance trade-off in gradient clipping, we show that when a symmetry measure of the noise tail is controlled, clipped SFOMs achieve improved complexity guarantees in the presence of heavy-tailed noise for any tail index $α\in (0,2]$. Our analysis of the bias-variance trade-off not only yields new unified complexity guarantees for clipped SFOMs across this full range of tail indices, but is also straightforward to apply and can be combined with classical analyses under light-tailed noise to establish oracle complexity guarantees under heavy-tailed noise. Finally, numerical experiments validate our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperCLIP: CLIP with Simple Classification Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14480v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) achieves strong generalization in vision-language tasks by aligning images and texts in a shared embedding space. However, recent findings show that CLIP-like models still underutilize fine-grained semantic signals in text, and this issue becomes even more pronounced when dealing with long and detailed captions. This stems from CLIP's training objective, which optimizes only global image-text similarity and overlooks token-level supervision - limiting its ability to achieve fine-grained visual-text alignment. To address this, we propose SuperCLIP, a simple yet effective framework that augments contrastive learning with classification-based supervision. By adding only a lightweight linear layer to the vision encoder, SuperCLIP leverages token-level cues to enhance visual-textual alignment - with just a 0.077% increase in total FLOPs, and no need for additional annotated data. Experiments show that SuperCLIP consistently improves zero-shot classification, image-text retrieval, and purely visual tasks. These gains hold regardless of whether the model is trained on original web data or rich re-captioned data, demonstrating SuperCLIP's ability to recover textual supervision in both cases. Furthermore, SuperCLIP alleviates CLIP's small-batch performance drop through classification-based supervision that avoids reliance on large batch sizes. Code and models will be made open source.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025. Code: https://github.com/hustvl/SuperCLIP</p></details> |
| **[Erasing CLIP Memories: Non-Destructive, Data-Free Zero-Shot class Unlearning in CLIP Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14137v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel, closed-form approach for selective unlearning in multimodal models, specifically targeting pretrained models such as CLIP. Our method leverages nullspace projection to erase the target class information embedded in the final projection layer, without requiring any retraining or the use of images from the forget set. By computing an orthonormal basis for the subspace spanned by target text embeddings and projecting these directions, we dramatically reduce the alignment between image features and undesired classes. Unlike traditional unlearning techniques that rely on iterative fine-tuning and extensive data curation, our approach is both computationally efficient and surgically precise. This leads to a pronounced drop in zero-shot performance for the target classes while preserving the overall multimodal knowledge of the model. Our experiments demonstrate that even a partial projection can balance between complete unlearning and retaining useful information, addressing key challenges in model decontamination and privacy preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective, Controlled and Domain-Agnostic Unlearning in Pretrained CLIP: A Training- and Data-Free Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14113v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pretrained models like CLIP have demonstrated impressive zero-shot classification capabilities across diverse visual domains, spanning natural images, artistic renderings, and abstract representations. However, real-world applications often demand the removal (or "unlearning") of specific object classes without requiring additional data or retraining, or affecting the model's performance on unrelated tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel training- and data-free unlearning framework that enables three distinct forgetting paradigms: (1) global unlearning of selected objects across all domains, (2) domain-specific knowledge removal (e.g., eliminating sketch representations while preserving photo recognition), and (3) complete unlearning in selective domains. By leveraging a multimodal nullspace through synergistic integration of text prompts and synthesized visual prototypes derived from CLIP's joint embedding space, our method efficiently removes undesired class information while preserving the remaining knowledge. This approach overcomes the limitations of existing retraining-based methods and offers a flexible and computationally efficient solution for controlled model forgetting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibrating Uncertainty for Zero-Shot Adversarial CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12997v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP delivers strong zero-shot classification but remains highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Previous work of adversarial fine-tuning largely focuses on matching the predicted logits between clean and adversarial examples, which overlooks uncertainty calibration and may degrade the zero-shot generalization. A common expectation in reliable uncertainty estimation is that predictive uncertainty should increase as inputs become more difficult or shift away from the training distribution. However, we frequently observe the opposite in the adversarial setting: perturbations not only degrade accuracy but also suppress uncertainty, leading to severe miscalibration and unreliable over-confidence. This overlooked phenomenon highlights a critical reliability gap beyond robustness. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel adversarial fine-tuning objective for CLIP considering both prediction accuracy and uncertainty alignments. By reparameterizing the output of CLIP as the concentration parameter of a Dirichlet distribution, we propose a unified representation that captures relative semantic structure and the magnitude of predictive confidence. Our objective aligns these distributions holistically under perturbations, moving beyond single-logit anchoring and restoring calibrated uncertainty. Experiments on multiple zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate that our approach effectively restores calibrated uncertainty and achieves competitive adversarial robustness while maintaining clean accuracy.</p></details> |  |

As adversarial fine-tuning is prohibitively costly, recent works explore various test-time defense strategies; however, these approaches still exhibit limited robustness. In this work, we revisit this problem and propose a simple yet effective strategy: Augmentation-based Test-time Adversarial Correction (ATAC). Our method operates directly in the embedding space of CLIP, calculating augmentation-induced drift vectors to infer a semantic recovery direction and correcting the embedding based on the angular consistency of these latent drifts. Across a wide range of benchmarks, ATAC consistently achieves remarkably high robustness, surpassing that of previous state-of-the-art methods by nearly 50\% on average, all while requiring minimal computational overhead. Furthermore, ATAC retains state-of-the-art robustness in unconventional and extreme settings and even achieves nontrivial robustness against adaptive attacks. Our results demonstrate that ATAC is an efficient method in a novel paradigm for test-time adversarial defenses in the embedding space of CLIP.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In this work, we propose $β$-CLIP, a multi-granular text-conditioned contrastive learning framework designed to achieve hierarchical alignment between multiple textual granularities-from full captions to sentences and phrases-and their corresponding visual regions. For each level of granularity, $β$-CLIP utilizes cross-attention to dynamically pool image patches, producing contextualized visual embeddings. To address the semantic overlap inherent in this hierarchy, we introduce the $β$-Contextualized Contrastive Alignment Loss ($β$-CAL). This objective parameterizes the trade-off between strict query-specific matching and relaxed intra-image contextualization, supporting both soft Cross-Entropy and hard Binary Cross-Entropy formulations. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that $β$-CLIP significantly improves dense alignment: achieving 91.8% T2I 92.3% I2T at R@1 on Urban1K and 30.9% on FG-OVD (Hard), setting state-of-the-art among methods trained without hard negatives. $β$-CLIP establishes a robust, adaptive baseline for dense vision-language correspondence. The code and models are released at https://github.com/fzohra/B-CLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimal Clips, Maximum Salience: Long Video Summarization via Key Moment Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11399v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are able to process increasingly longer videos. Yet, important visual information is easily lost throughout the entire context and missed by VLMs. Also, it is important to design tools that enable cost-effective analysis of lengthy video content. In this paper, we propose a clip selection method that targets key video moments to be included in a multimodal summary. We divide the video into short clips and generate compact visual descriptions of each using a lightweight video captioning model. These are then passed to a large language model (LLM), which selects the K clips containing the most relevant visual information for a multimodal summary. We evaluate our approach on reference clips for the task, automatically derived from full human-annotated screenplays and summaries in the MovieSum dataset. We further show that these reference clips (less than 6% of the movie) are sufficient to build a complete multimodal summary of the movies in MovieSum. Using our clip selection method, we achieve a summarization performance close to that of these reference clips while capturing substantially more relevant video information than random clip selection. Importantly, we maintain low computational cost by relying on a lightweight captioning model.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce the linear constraint-driven clipping framework, a class of scalable and efficient methods designed to enhance the efficacy of NN verifiers. Under this framework, we develop two novel algorithms that efficiently utilize linear constraints to 1) reduce portions of the input space that are either verified or irrelevant to a subproblem in the context of branch-and-bound, and 2) directly improve intermediate bounds throughout the network. The process novelly leverages linear constraints that often arise from bound propagation methods and is general enough to also incorporate constraints from other sources. It efficiently handles linear constraints using a specialized GPU procedure that can scale to large neural networks without the use of expensive external solvers. Our verification procedure, Clip-and-Verify, consistently tightens bounds across multiple benchmarks and can significantly reduce the number of subproblems handled during BaB. We show that our clipping algorithms can be integrated with BaB-based verifiers such as $α,β$-CROWN, utilizing either the split constraints in activation-space BaB or the output constraints that denote the unverified input space. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our procedure on a broad range of benchmarks where, in some instances, we witness a 96% reduction in the number of subproblems during branch-and-bound, and also achieve state-of-the-art verified accuracy across multiple benchmarks. Clip-and-Verify is part of the $α,β$-CROWN verifier (http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2025 winner.

This requires multimodal reasoning over text, visual pointing cues, and scene context, yet existing methods often fail to fully exploit visual disambiguation signals. We also observe that while the referent often aligns with the head-to-fingertip direction, in many cases it aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip direction, making a single-line assumption overly limiting. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To fuse their complementary strengths, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble guided by CLIP features. We further incorporate an auxiliary object center prediction head to enhance referent localization. We validate our approach on YouRefIt, achieving 75.0 mAP at 0.25 IoU, alongside state-of-the-art CLIP and C_D scores, and demonstrate its generality on unseen CAESAR and ISL Pointing, showing robust performance across benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WACV 2026</p></details> |

This capability is vital for high-stakes decision-making in systems such as traffic networks, power grids, and disease propagation. However, the field remains underdeveloped because most existing works prioritize predictive accuracy over reasoning. To address the gap, we introduce ST-Bench, a benchmark consisting of four core tasks, including etiological reasoning, entity identification, correlation reasoning, and in-context forecasting, developed via a network SDE-based multi-agent data synthesis pipeline. We then propose STReasoner, which empowers LLM to integrate time series, graph structure, and text for explicit reasoning. To promote spatially grounded logic, we introduce S-GRPO, a reinforcement learning algorithm that rewards performance gains specifically attributable to spatial information. Experiments show that STReasoner achieves average accuracy gains between 17% and 135% at only 0.004X the cost of proprietary models and generalizes robustly to real-world data.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint, we release our code publicly at https://github.com/LingFengGold/STReasoner</p></details> |

Prior diffusion unlearning methods typically rely on supervised weight edits or global penalties; reinforcement-learning (RL) approaches, while flexible, often optimize sparse end-of-trajectory rewards, yielding high-variance updates and weak credit assignment. We present a general RL framework for diffusion unlearning that treats denoising as a sequential decision process and introduces a timestep-aware critic with noisy-step rewards. Concretely, we train a CLIP-based reward predictor on noisy latents and use its per-step signal to compute advantage estimates for policy-gradient updates of the reverse diffusion kernel. Our algorithm is simple to implement, supports off-policy reuse, and plugs into standard text-to-image backbones. Across multiple concepts, the method achieves better or comparable forgetting to strong baselines while maintaining image quality and benign prompt fidelity; ablations show that (i) per-step critics and (ii) noisy-conditioned rewards are key to stability and effectiveness. We release code and evaluation scripts to facilitate reproducibility and future research on RL-based diffusion unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Although Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has succeeded in specific domains , the field lacks large-scale, high-quality, and difficulty-calibrated data for general reasoning. To address this, we propose UltraLogic, a framework that decouples the logical core of a problem from its natural language expression through a Code-based Solving methodology to automate high-quality data production. The framework comprises hundreds of unique task types and an automated calibration pipeline across ten difficulty levels. Furthermore, to mitigate binary reward sparsity and the Non-negative Reward Trap, we introduce the Bipolar Float Reward (BFR) mechanism, utilizing graded penalties to effectively distinguish perfect responses from those with logical flaws. Our experiments demonstrate that task diversity is the primary driver for reasoning enhancement , and that BFR, combined with a difficulty matching strategy, significantly improves training efficiency, guiding models toward global logical optima.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

While Large Language Models possess strong reasoning capabilities, they struggle to emulate this self-evolution: fine-tuning is computationally expensive and prone to catastrophic forgetting, while existing memory-based methods rely on passive semantic matching that often retrieves noise. To address these challenges, we propose MemRL, a framework that enables agents to self-evolve via non-parametric reinforcement learning on episodic memory. MemRL explicitly separates the stable reasoning of a frozen LLM from the plastic, evolving memory. Unlike traditional methods, MemRL employs a Two-Phase Retrieval mechanism that filters candidates by semantic relevance and then selects them based on learned Q-values (utility). These utilities are continuously refined via environmental feedback in an trial-and-error manner, allowing the agent to distinguish high-value strategies from similar noise. Extensive experiments on HLE, BigCodeBench, ALFWorld, and Lifelong Agent Bench demonstrate that MemRL significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Our analysis experiments confirm that MemRL effectively reconciles the stability-plasticity dilemma, enabling continuous runtime improvement without weight updates.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |

The tool will be open-sourced and a tutorial for energy efficiency testing in ns-O-RAN.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Reasoning Skills in Small Persian Medical Language Models Can Outperform Large-Scale Data Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20059v5)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing reasoning capabilities in small language models is critical for specialized applications such as medical question answering, particularly in underrepresented languages like Persian. In this study, we employ Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) and Direct preference optimization (DPO) to improve the reasoning skills of a general-purpose Persian language model. To achieve this, we translated a multiple-choice medical question-answering dataset into Persian and used RLAIF to generate rejected-preferred answer pairs, which are essential for DPO training. By prompting both teacher and student models to produce Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning responses, we compiled a dataset containing correct and incorrect reasoning trajectories. This dataset, comprising 2 million tokens in preferred answers and 2.5 million tokens in rejected ones, was used to train a baseline model, significantly enhancing its medical reasoning capabilities in Persian. Remarkably, the resulting model outperformed its predecessor, gaokerena-V, which was trained on approximately 57 million tokens, despite leveraging a much smaller dataset. These results highlight the efficiency and effectiveness of reasoning-focused training approaches in developing domain-specific language models with limited data availability.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |
| **[DisCO: Reinforcing Large Reasoning Models with Discriminative Constrained Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12366v5)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent success and openness of DeepSeek-R1 have brought widespread attention to Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reinforcement learning method for large reasoning models (LRMs). In this work, we analyze the GRPO objective under a binary reward setting and reveal an inherent limitation of question-level difficulty bias. We also identify a connection between GRPO and traditional discriminative methods in supervised learning. Motivated by these insights, we introduce a new Discriminative Constrained Optimization (DisCO) framework for reinforcing LRMs, grounded in the principle of discriminative learning. The main differences between DisCO and GRPO and its recent variants are: (1) it replaces the group relative objective with a discriminative objective defined by a scoring function; (2) it abandons clipping-based surrogates in favor of non-clipping RL surrogate objectives used as scoring functions; (3) it employs a simple yet effective constrained optimization approach to enforce the KL divergence constraint. As a result, DisCO offers notable advantages over GRPO and its variants: (i) it completely eliminates difficulty bias by adopting discriminative objectives; (ii) it addresses the entropy instability in GRPO and its variants through the use of non-clipping scoring functions and a constrained optimization approach, yielding long and stable training dynamics; (iii) it allows the incorporation of advanced discriminative learning techniques to address data imbalance, where a significant number of questions have more negative than positive generated answers during training. Our experiments on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of SFT-finetuned models show that DisCO significantly outperforms GRPO and its improved variants such as DAPO, achieving average gains of 7\% over GRPO and 6\% over DAPO across six benchmark tasks for a 1.5B model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

However, planning remains a bottleneck, as existing methods struggle with long-horizon strategies. Our analysis reveals a critical phenomenon, plan anchor, where the first reasoning step disproportionately impacts downstream behavior in long-horizon web reasoning tasks. Current RL algorithms, fail to account for this by uniformly distributing rewards across the trajectory. To address this, we propose Anchor-GRPO, a two-stage RL framework that decouples planning and execution. In Stage 1, the agent optimizes its first-step planning using fine-grained rubrics derived from self-play experiences and human calibration. In Stage 2, execution is aligned with the initial plan through sparse rewards, ensuring stable and efficient tool usage. We evaluate Anchor-GRPO on four benchmarks: BrowseComp, BrowseComp-Zh, GAIA, and XBench-DeepSearch. Across models from 3B to 30B, Anchor-GRPO outperforms baseline GRPO and First-step GRPO, improving task success and tool efficiency. Notably, WebAnchor-30B achieves 46.0% pass@1 on BrowseComp and 76.4% on GAIA. Anchor-GRPO also demonstrates strong scalability, getting higher accuracy as model size and context length increase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Thinker: A General Reasoning Modular Core for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03127v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Coupling: The Hidden Barrier to Generalization in Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23870v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a dominant paradigm for training autonomous agents, yet these agents often exhibit poor generalization, failing to adapt to scenarios not seen during training. In this work, we identify a fundamental cause of this brittleness, a phenomenon which we term "gradient coupling." We hypothesize that in complex agentic tasks, the high similarity between distinct states leads to destructive interference between gradients. Specifically, a gradient update that reinforces an optimal action in one state can inadvertently increase the likelihood of a suboptimal action in a similar, yet different, state. To solve this, we propose a novel objective where the actor is trained to simultaneously function as a classifier that separates good and bad actions. This auxiliary pressure compels the model to learn disentangled embeddings for positive and negative actions, which mitigates negative gradient interference and improve the generalization performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Sample to Rule Them All: Extreme Data Efficiency in RL Scaling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03111v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) can be unleashed with reinforcement learning (RL) (OpenAI, 2024; DeepSeek-AI et al., 2025a; Zeng et al., 2025). The success of existing RL attempts in LLMs usually relies on high-quality samples of thousands or beyond. In this paper, we challenge fundamental assumptions about data requirements in RL for LLMs by demonstrating the remarkable effectiveness of one-shot learning. Specifically, we introduce polymath learning, a framework for designing one training sample that elicits multidisciplinary impact. We present three key findings: (1) A single, strategically selected math reasoning sample can produce significant performance improvements across multiple domains, including physics, chemistry, and biology with RL; (2) The math skills salient to reasoning suggest the characteristics of the optimal polymath sample; and (3) An engineered synthetic sample that integrates multidiscipline elements outperforms training with individual samples that naturally occur. Our approach achieves superior performance to training with larger datasets across various reasoning benchmarks, demonstrating that sample quality and design, rather than quantity, may be the key to unlock enhanced reasoning capabilities in language models. Our results suggest a shift, dubbed as sample engineering, toward precision engineering of training samples rather than simply increasing data volume.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Comedy of Estimators: On KL Regularization in RL Training of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21852v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning performance of large language models (LLMs) can be substantially improved by training them with reinforcement learning (RL). The RL objective for LLM training involves a regularization term, which is the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the trained policy and the reference policy. Since computing the KL divergence exactly is intractable, various estimators are used in practice to estimate it from on-policy samples. Despite its wide adoption, including in several open-source libraries, there is no systematic study analyzing the numerous ways of incorporating KL estimators in the objective and their effect on the downstream performance of RL-trained models. Recent works show that prevailing practices for incorporating KL regularization do not provide correct gradients for stated objectives, creating a discrepancy between the objective and its implementation. In this paper, we further analyze these practices and study the gradients of several estimators configurations, revealing how design choices shape gradient bias. We substantiate these findings with empirical observations by RL fine-tuning \texttt{Qwen2.5-7B}, \texttt{Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct} and \texttt{Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507} with different configurations and evaluating their performance on both in- and out-of-distribution tasks. Through our analysis, we observe that, in on-policy settings: (1) estimator configurations with biased gradients can result in training instabilities; and (2) using estimator configurations resulting in unbiased gradients leads to better performance on in-domain as well as out-of-domain tasks. We also investigate the performance resulting from different KL configurations in off-policy settings and observe that KL regularization can help stabilize off-policy RL training resulting from asynchronous setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[IBISAgent: Reinforcing Pixel-Level Visual Reasoning in MLLMs for Universal Biomedical Object Referring and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03054v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research on medical MLLMs has gradually shifted its focus from image-level understanding to fine-grained, pixel-level comprehension. Although segmentation serves as the foundation for pixel-level understanding, existing approaches face two major challenges. First, they introduce implicit segmentation tokens and require simultaneous fine-tuning of both the MLLM and external pixel decoders, which increases the risk of catastrophic forgetting and limits generalization to out-of-domain scenarios. Second, most methods rely on single-pass reasoning and lack the capability to iteratively refine segmentation results, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel agentic MLLM, named IBISAgent, that reformulates segmentation as a vision-centric, multi-step decision-making process. IBISAgent enables MLLMs to generate interleaved reasoning and text-based click actions, invoke segmentation tools, and produce high-quality masks without architectural modifications. By iteratively performing multi-step visual reasoning on masked image features, IBISAgent naturally supports mask refinement and promotes the development of pixel-level visual reasoning capabilities. We further design a two-stage training framework consisting of cold-start supervised fine-tuning and agentic reinforcement learning with tailored, fine-grained rewards, enhancing the model's robustness in complex medical referring and reasoning segmentation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IBISAgent consistently outperforms both closed-source and open-source SOTA methods. All datasets, code, and trained models will be released publicly.</p></details> |  |
| **[SOP: A Scalable Online Post-Training System for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03044v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language-action (VLA) models achieve strong generalization through large-scale pre-training, but real-world deployment requires expert-level task proficiency in addition to broad generality. Existing post-training approaches for VLA models are typically offline, single-robot, or task-specific, limiting effective on-policy adaptation and scalable learning from real-world interaction. We introduce a Scalable Online Post-training (SOP) system that enables online, distributed, multi-task post-training of generalist VLA models directly in the physical world. SOP tightly couples execution and learning through a closed-loop architecture in which a fleet of robots continuously streams on-policy experience and human intervention signals to a centralized cloud learner, and asynchronously receives updated policies. This design supports prompt on-policy correction, scales experience collection through parallel deployment, and preserves generality during adaptation. SOP is agnostic to the choice of post-training algorithm; we instantiate it with both interactive imitation learning (HG-DAgger) and reinforcement learning (RECAP). Across a range of real-world manipulation tasks including cloth folding, box assembly, and grocery restocking, we show that SOP substantially improves the performance of large pretrained VLA models while maintaining a single shared policy across tasks. Effective post-training can be achieved within hours of real-world interaction, and performance scales near-linearly with the number of robots in the fleet. These results suggest that tightly coupling online learning with fleet-scale deployment is instrumental to enabling efficient, reliable, and scalable post-training of generalist robot policies in the physical world.</p></details> |  |

In response, detection methods have evolved from traditional approaches to multimodal large language models (MLLMs), offering enhanced transparency and interpretability in identifying synthetic media. However, current detection systems remain fundamentally limited by their single-modality design. These approaches analyze images or videos separately, making them ineffective against synthetic content that combines multiple media formats. To address these challenges, we introduce \textbf{BusterX++}, a framework for unified detection and explanation of synthetic image and video, with a direct reinforcement learning (RL) post-training strategy. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we also present \textbf{GenBuster++}, a unified benchmark leveraging state-of-the-art image and video generation techniques. This benchmark comprises 4,000 images and video clips, meticulously curated by human experts to ensure high quality, diversity, and real-world applicability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.</p></details> |  |

Standard supervised training lacks explicit annotations for symptom evolution, while direct Reinforcement Learning (RL) is hindered by sparse binary rewards. To address this challenge, we introduce Dementia-R1, an RL-based framework for longitudinal dementia prognosis from unstructured clinical notes. Our approach adopts a Cold-Start RL strategy that pre-trains the model to predict verifiable clinical indices extracted from patient histories, enhancing the capability to reason about disease progression before determining the final clinical status. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Dementia-R1 achieves an F1 score of 77.03% on real-world unstructured clinical datasets.

We introduce SPICE, a Bayesian ICRL method that learns a prior over Q-values via deep ensemble and updates this prior at test-time using in-context information through Bayesian updates. To recover from poor priors resulting from training on sub-optimal data, our online inference follows an Upper-Confidence Bound rule that favours exploration and adaptation. We prove that SPICE achieves regret-optimal behaviour in both stochastic bandits and finite-horizon MDPs, even when pretrained only on suboptimal trajectories. We validate these findings empirically across bandit and control benchmarks. SPICE achieves near-optimal decisions on unseen tasks, substantially reduces regret compared to prior ICRL and meta-RL approaches while rapidly adapting to unseen tasks and remaining robust under distribution shift.</p></details> |  |

While recent reasoning models perform well across many domains, purely text-based reasoning struggles to capture structural constraints in complex settings. In this paper, we introduce FIGR, which integrates executable visual construction into multi-turn reasoning via end-to-end reinforcement learning. Rather than relying solely on textual chains of thought, FIGR externalizes intermediate hypotheses by generating executable code that constructs diagrams within the reasoning loop. An adaptive reward mechanism selectively regulates when visual construction is invoked, enabling more consistent reasoning over latent global properties that are difficult to infer from text alone. Experiments on eight challenging mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that FIGR outperforms strong text-only chain-of-thought baselines, improving the base model by 13.12% on AIME 2025 and 11.00% on BeyondAIME. These results highlight the effectiveness of precise, controllable figure construction of FIGR in enhancing complex reasoning ability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconsidering Overthinking: Penalizing Internal and External Redundancy in CoT Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02178v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, generating verbose reasoning traces that compromise both computational efficiency and interpretability. Unlike prior efforts that rely on global length-based rewards, we propose a semantic-aware decomposition of redundancy into two distinct forms: internal redundancy (informational stagnation within the reasoning process) and external redundancy (superfluous continuation after the final answer). We introduce a dual-penalty reinforcement learning framework that surgically targets these inefficiencies: a sliding-window semantic analysis is employed to penalize low-gain steps within the reasoning trajectory, while a normalized metric suppresses the post-answer tail. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly compresses Chain-of-Thought traces with minimal accuracy degradation, while maintaining strong generalization to out-of-domain tasks. Crucially, we reveal an asymmetry in redundancy: external redundancy can be safely eliminated without performance loss, whereas internal redundancy removal requires a calibrated trade-off to maintain reasoning fidelity. Our framework enables fine-grained, implicit control over reasoning length, paving the way for more concise and interpretable LRMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interpretable All-Type Audio Deepfake Detection with Audio LLMs via Frequency-Time Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02983v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in audio large language models (ALLMs) have made high-quality synthetic audio widely accessible, increasing the risk of malicious audio deepfakes across speech, environmental sounds, singing voice, and music. Real-world audio deepfake detection (ADD) therefore requires all-type detectors that generalize across heterogeneous audio and provide interpretable decisions. Given the strong multi-task generalization ability of ALLMs, we first investigate their performance on all-type ADD under both supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT). However, SFT using only binary real/fake labels tends to reduce the model to a black-box classifier, sacrificing interpretability. Meanwhile, vanilla RFT under sparse supervision is prone to reward hacking and can produce hallucinated, ungrounded rationales. To address this, we propose an automatic annotation and polishing pipeline that constructs Frequency-Time structured chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales, producing ~340K cold-start demonstrations. Building on CoT data, we propose Frequency Time-Group Relative Policy Optimization (FT-GRPO), a two-stage training paradigm that cold-starts ALLMs with SFT and then applies GRPO under rule-based frequency-time constraints. Experiments demonstrate that FT-GRPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on all-type ADD while producing interpretable, FT-grounded rationales. The data and code are available online.</p></details> |  |

Although LLMs show promise in code generation and domain-specific question answering, their performance in MD scenarios is limited by scarce domain data, the high deployment cost of state-of-the-art LLMs, and low code executability. Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.

| **[Learning mirror maps in policy mirror descent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05187v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Policy Mirror Descent (PMD) is a popular framework in reinforcement learning, serving as a unifying perspective that encompasses numerous algorithms. These algorithms are derived through the selection of a mirror map and enjoy finite-time convergence guarantees. Despite its popularity, the exploration of PMD's full potential is limited, with the majority of research focusing on a particular mirror map -- namely, the negative entropy -- which gives rise to the renowned Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) method. It remains uncertain from existing theoretical studies whether the choice of mirror map significantly influences PMD's efficacy. In our work, we conduct empirical investigations to show that the conventional mirror map choice (NPG) often yields less-than-optimal outcomes across several standard benchmark environments. Using evolutionary strategies, we identify more efficient mirror maps that enhance the performance of PMD. We first focus on a tabular environment, i.e. Grid-World, where we relate existing theoretical bounds with the performance of PMD for a few standard mirror maps and the learned one. We then show that it is possible to learn a mirror map that outperforms the negative entropy in more complex environments, such as the MinAtar suite. Additionally, we demonstrate that the learned mirror maps generalize effectively to different tasks by testing each map across various other environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Correct, Concise and Complete: Multi-stage Training For Adaptive Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02972v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have improved substantially through increased test-time computation, typically in the form of intermediate tokens known as chain-of-thought (CoT). However, CoT often becomes unnecessarily long, increasing computation cost without actual accuracy gains or sometimes even degrading performance, a phenomenon known as ``overthinking''. We propose a multi-stage efficient reasoning method that combines supervised fine-tuning -- via rejection sampling or reasoning trace reformatting -- with reinforcement learning using an adaptive length penalty. We introduce a lightweight reward function that penalizes tokens generated after the first correct answer but encouraging self-verification only when beneficial. We conduct a holistic evaluation across seven diverse reasoning tasks, analyzing the accuracy-response length trade-off. Our approach reduces response length by an average of 28\% for 8B models and 40\% for 32B models, while incurring only minor performance drops of 1.6 and 2.5 points, respectively. Despite its conceptual simplicity, it achieves a superior trade-off compared to more complex state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods, scoring 76.6, in terms of the area under the Overthinking-Adjusted Accuracy curve ($\text{AUC}_{\text{OAA}}$) -- 5 points above the base model and 2.5 points above the second-best approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[The World is Not Mono: Enabling Spatial Understanding in Large Audio-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02954v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing large audio-language models perceive the world as "mono" -- a single stream of audio that ignores the critical spatial dimension ("where") required for universal acoustic scene analysis. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a hierarchical framework for Auditory Scene Analysis (ASA). Guided by this framework, we introduce a system that enables models like Qwen2-Audio to understand and reason about the complex acoustic world. Our framework achieves this through three core contributions: First, we build a large-scale, synthesized binaural audio dataset to provide the rich spatial cues. Second, we design a hybrid feature projector, which leverages parallel semantic and spatial encoders to extract decoupled representations. These distinct streams are integrated via a dense fusion mechanism, ensuring the model receives a holistic view of the acoustic scene. Finally, we employ a progressive training curriculum, advancing from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), to explicitly evolve the model's capabilities towards reasoning. On our comprehensive benchmark, the model demonstrates comparatively strong capability for spatial understanding. By enabling this spatial perception, our work provides a clear pathway for leveraging the powerful reasoning abilities of large models towards holistic acoustic scene analysis, advancing from "mono" semantic recognition to spatial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Not Step Into the Same River Twice: Learning to Reason from Trial and Error](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26109v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has significantly boosted the reasoning capability of language models (LMs) recently. However, existing RLVR approaches merely train LMs based on their own generated on-policy responses and are constrained by the initial capability of LMs, thus prone to exploration stagnation, in which LMs fail to solve more training problems and cannot further learn from the training data. Some work tries to address this by leveraging off-policy solutions to training problems, but relies on external expert guidance that is limited in availability and scalability. In this work, we propose LTE (Learning to reason from Trial and Error), an approach that hints LMs with their previously self-made mistakes, not requiring any external expert guidance. Experiments validate the effectiveness of LTE, which outperforms the normal group relative policy optimization (GRPO) by 5.02 in Pass@1 and 9.96 in Pass@k on average across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks for Qwen3-8B-Base and even performs better than methods that require external gold solutions as guidance after aligning the experimental setup. Further analysis confirms that LTE successfully mitigates exploration stagnation and enhances both exploitation and exploration during training.

Previous methods typically focus on predicting numerical scores without explanation or provide low-level descriptions lacking precise scores. Recent reasoning-based vision language models (VLMs) have shown strong potential for IQA, enabling joint generation of quality descriptions and scores. However, we notice that existing VLM-based IQA methods tend to exhibit unreliable reasoning due to their limited capability of integrating visual and textual cues. In this work, we introduce Zoom-IQA, a VLM-based IQA model to explicitly emulate key cognitive behaviors: uncertainty awareness, region reasoning, and iterative refinement. Specifically, we present a two-stage training pipeline: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on our Grounded-Rationale-IQA (GR-IQA) dataset to teach the model to ground its assessments in key regions; and 2) reinforcement learning (RL) for dynamic policy exploration, primarily stabilized by our KL-Coverage regularizer to prevent reasoning and scoring diversity collapse, and supported by a Progressive Re-sampling Strategy to mitigate annotation bias. Extensive experiments show that Zoom-IQA achieves improved robustness, explainability, and generalization. The application to downstream tasks, such as image restoration, further demonstrates the effectiveness of Zoom-IQA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://ethanliang99.github.io/ZOOMIQA-Projectpage</p></details> |

While LLMs have been applied to molecular simplified molecular input line entry system (SMILES) in computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP), existing methodologies typically address single tasks, such as precursor prediction. We introduce ChemBART, a SMILES-based LLM pre-trained on chemical reactions, which enables a unified model for multiple downstream chemical tasks--achieving the paradigm of "one model, one pre-training, multiple tasks." By leveraging outputs from a mask-filling pre-training task on reaction expressions, ChemBART effectively solves a variety of chemical problems, including precursor/reagent generation, temperature-yield regression, molecular property classification, and optimizing the policy and value functions within a reinforcement learning framework, integrated with Monte Carlo tree search for multi-step synthesis route design. Unlike single-molecule pre-trained LLMs constrained to specific applications, ChemBART addresses broader chemical challenges and integrates them for comprehensive synthesis planning. Crucially, ChemBART-designed multi-step synthesis routes and reaction conditions directly inspired wet-lab validation, which confirmed shorter pathways with ~30% yield improvement over literature benchmarks. Our work validates the power of reaction-focused pre-training and showcases the broad utility of ChemBART in advancing the complete synthesis planning cycle.</p></details> |  |

Although supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning have proven effective for training such agents, their performance is heavily constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, goal-oriented domain-specific training data. To address this challenge, we propose SimRPD, a three-stage framework for training recruitment proactive dialogue agents. First, we develop a high-fidelity user simulator to synthesize large-scale conversational data through multi-turn online dialogue. Then we introduce a multi-dimensional evaluation framework based on Chain-of-Intention (CoI) to comprehensively assess the simulator and effectively select high-quality data, incorporating both global-level and instance-level metrics. Finally, we train the recruitment proactive dialogue agent on the selected dataset. Experiments in a real-world recruitment scenario demonstrate that SimRPD outperforms existing simulator-based data selection strategies, highlighting its practical value for industrial deployment and its potential applicability to other business-oriented dialogue scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sample-Efficient Neurosymbolic Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02850v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a well-established framework for sequential decision-making in complex environments. However, state-of-the-art Deep RL (DRL) algorithms typically require large training datasets and often struggle to generalize beyond small-scale training scenarios, even within standard benchmarks. We propose a neuro-symbolic DRL approach that integrates background symbolic knowledge to improve sample efficiency and generalization to more challenging, unseen tasks. Partial policies defined for simple domain instances, where high performance is easily attained, are transferred as useful priors to accelerate learning in more complex settings and avoid tuning DRL parameters from scratch. To do so, partial policies are represented as logical rules, and online reasoning is performed to guide the training process through two mechanisms: (i) biasing the action distribution during exploration, and (ii) rescaling Q-values during exploitation. This neuro-symbolic integration enhances interpretability and trustworthiness while accelerating convergence, particularly in sparse-reward environments and tasks with long planning horizons. We empirically validate our methodology on challenging variants of gridworld environments, both in the fully observable and partially observable setting. We show improved performance over a state-of-the-art reward machine baseline.</p></details> |  |

We present several key adaptations to diffusion models, which are important in this discrete setting. Notably, we show that a location-aware palette with our 2D gray code ordering improves performance. Adding a final tanh activation function is crucial for discrete data. On optimizing diffusion parameters, the sigmoid loss weighting consistently outperforms alternatives, regardless of the prediction type used, and we settle on x-prediction. While our current model does not yet surpass leading mask-based architectures, it narrows the performance gap and introduces unique capabilities, such as principled ambiguity modeling, that these models lack. All models were trained from scratch, and we believe that combining our proposed improvements with large-scale pretraining or promptable conditioning could lead to competitive models.</p></details> | Accepted at NLDL 26 |
| **[An Uncertainty-Aware Generalization Framework for Cardiovascular Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14305v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models have achieved significant success in segmenting cardiovascular structures, but there is a growing need to improve their generalization and robustness. Current methods often face challenges such as overfitting and limited accuracy, largely due to their reliance on large annotated datasets and limited optimization techniques. This paper introduces the UU-Mamba model, an extension of the U-Mamba architecture, designed to address these challenges in both cardiac and vascular segmentation. By incorporating Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), the model enhances generalization by seeking flatter minima in the loss landscape. Additionally, we propose an uncertainty-aware loss function that integrates region-based, distribution-based, and pixel-based components, improving segmentation accuracy by capturing both local and global features. We expand our evaluations on the ImageCAS (coronary artery) and Aorta (aortic branches and zones) datasets, which present more complex segmentation challenges than the ACDC dataset (left and right ventricles) used in prior work, showcasing the model's adaptability and resilience. Our results confirm UU-Mamba's superior performance compared to leading models such as TransUNet, Swin-Unet, nnUNet, and nnFormer. We also provide a more in-depth assessment of the model's robustness and segmentation accuracy through extensive experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical image segmentation remains challenging due to its limited adaptability across diverse medical domains. Although fine-tuned variants, such as MedSAM, improve performance in scenarios similar to the training modalities or organs, they may lack generalizability to unseen data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a lightweight and flexible framework that preserves SAM's inherent generalization ability while enhancing segmentation accuracy for medical images. SAM-TTA tackles two major challenges: (1) input-level discrepancy caused by channel mismatches between natural and medical images, and (2) semantic-level discrepancy due to different object characteristics in natural versus medical images (e.g., with clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). To this end, we introduce two complementary components: a self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which maps single-channel medical images into SAM-compatible three-channel images via a few learnable parameters to be optimized at test time; and IoU-guided Multi-scale Adaptation (IMA), which leverages SAM's intrinsic IoU scores to enforce high output confidence, dual-scale prediction consistency, and intermediate feature consistency, to improve semantic-level alignments. Extensive experiments on eight public medical image segmentation tasks, covering six grayscale and two color (endoscopic) tasks, demonstrate that SAM-TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods. Notably, on six grayscale datasets, SAM-TTA even surpasses fully fine-tuned models, achieving significant Dice improvements (i.e., average 4.8% and 7.4% gains over MedSAM and SAM-Med2D) and establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

Nevertheless, their performance drops significantly on severely degraded, low-quality images, limiting their effectiveness in real-world scenarios. To address this, we propose GleSAM++, which utilizes Generative Latent space Enhancement to boost robustness on low-quality images, thus enabling generalization across various image qualities. Additionally, to improve compatibility between the pre-trained diffusion model and the segmentation framework, we introduce two techniques, i.e., Feature Distribution Alignment (FDA) and Channel Replication and Expansion (CRE). However, the above components lack explicit guidance regarding the degree of degradation. The model is forced to implicitly fit a complex noise distribution that spans conditions from mild noise to severe artifacts, which substantially increases the learning burden and leads to suboptimal reconstructions. To address this issue, we further introduce a Degradation-aware Adaptive Enhancement (DAE) mechanism. The key principle of DAE is to decouple the reconstruction process for arbitrary-quality features into two stages: degradation-level prediction and degradation-aware reconstruction. Our method can be applied to pre-trained SAM and SAM2 with only minimal additional learnable parameters, allowing for efficient optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GleSAM++ significantly improves segmentation robustness on complex degradations while maintaining generalization to clear images. Furthermore, GleSAM++ also performs well on unseen degradations, underscoring the versatility of our approach and dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Diffu...</summary><p>Diffusion-based latent space enhancement helps improve the robustness of SAM</p></details> |

Existing vision-language models, which primarily rely on backbone architectures or CLIP-based embedding learning, demonstrate inherent limitations in fine-grained spatial localization and operational capabilities. This paper introduces SJTU: Spatial Judgments in Multimodal Models - Towards Unified Segmentation through Coordinate Detection, a framework that leverages spatial coordinate understanding to bridge vision-language interaction and precise segmentation, enabling accurate target identification through natural language instructions. The framework presents an approach for integrating segmentation techniques with vision-language models through spatial inference in multimodal space. By utilizing normalized coordinate detection for bounding boxes and transforming them into actionable segmentation outputs, we establish a connection between spatial and language representations in multimodal architectures. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across benchmark datasets, achieving IoU scores of 0.5958 on COCO 2017 and 0.6758 on Pascal VOC. Testing on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 512x512 resolution images yields an average inference time of 7 seconds per image, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in both accuracy and practical deployability.

Despite advancements in AI, clinically viable segmentation is often hindered by the scarcity of 3D annotations, patient-specific variability, data privacy concerns, and substantial computational overhead. In this work, we propose FALCON, a cross-domain few-shot segmentation framework that achieves high-precision 3D volume segmentation by processing data as 2D slices. The framework is first meta-trained on natural images to learn-to-learn generalizable segmentation priors, then transferred to the medical domain via adversarial fine-tuning and boundary-aware learning. Task-aware inference, conditioned on support cues, allows FALCON to adapt dynamically to patient-specific anatomical variations across slices. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that FALCON consistently achieves the lowest Hausdorff Distance scores, indicating superior boundary accuracy while maintaining a Dice Similarity Coefficient comparable to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, these results are achieved with significantly less labeled data, no data augmentation, and substantially lower computational overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

This issue is particularly pronounced in clinical settings due to the scarcity of annotated data resulting from the professional and private nature of medical data. Although various cross-domain strategies have been explored, including frequency-based approaches that vary appearance while preserving semantics, many remain limited by data constraints and computational cost. To tackle domain shifts in data-scarce medical scenarios, we propose a Random frequency filtering enabled Single-source Domain Generalization algorithm (RaffeSDG), which promises robust out-of-domain inference with segmentation models trained on a single-source domain. A frequency filter-based data augmentation strategy is first proposed to promote domain variability within a single-source domain by introducing variations in frequency space and blending homologous samples. Then Gaussian filter-based structural saliency is also leveraged to learn robust representations across augmented samples, further facilitating the training of generalizable segmentation models. To validate the effectiveness of RaffeSDG, we conducted extensive experiments involving out-of-domain inference on segmentation tasks for three human tissues imaged by four diverse modalities. Through thorough investigations and comparisons, compelling evidence was observed in these experiments, demonstrating the potential and generalizability of RaffeSDG.

Although convolutional networks provide local precision at $\mathcal{O}(n)$ cost but limited receptive fields, vision transformers achieve global context through $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ self-attention at prohibitive computational expense, causing overfitting on small clinical datasets. We propose S2M-Net, a 4.7M-parameter architecture that achieves $\mathcal{O}(HW \log HW)$ global context through two synergistic innovations: (i) Spectral-Selective Token Mixer (SSTM), which exploits the spectral concentration of medical images via truncated 2D FFT with learnable frequency filtering and content-gated spatial projection, avoiding quadratic attention cost while maintaining global receptive fields; and (ii) Morphology-Aware Adaptive Segmentation Loss (MASL), which automatically analyzes structure characteristics (compactness, tubularity, irregularity, scale) to modulate five complementary loss components through constrained learnable weights, eliminating manual per-dataset tuning. Comprehensive evaluation in 16 medical imaging datasets that span 8 modalities demonstrates state-of-the-art performance: 96.12\% Dice on polyp segmentation, 83.77\% on surgical instruments (+17.85\% over the prior art) and 80.90\% on brain tumors, with consistent 3-18\% improvements over specialized baselines while using 3.5--6$\times$ fewer parameters than transformer-based methods.</p></details> |  |

Existing semi-supervised methods demonstrate substantial performance degradation compared to fully supervised approaches, particularly in small target segmentation and boundary refinement tasks. To address these fundamental challenges, we propose SASNet (Scale-aware Adaptive Supervised Network), a dual-branch architecture that leverages both low-level and high-level feature representations through novel scale-aware adaptive reweight mechanisms. Our approach introduces three key methodological innovations, including the Scale-aware Adaptive Reweight strategy that dynamically weights pixel-wise predictions using temporal confidence accumulation, the View Variance Enhancement mechanism employing 3D Fourier domain transformations to simulate annotation variability, and segmentation-regression consistency learning through signed distance map algorithms for enhanced boundary precision. These innovations collectively address the core limitations of existing semi-supervised approaches by integrating spatial, temporal, and geometric consistency principles within a unified optimization framework. Comprehensive evaluation across LA, Pancreas-CT, and BraTS datasets demonstrates that SASNet achieves superior performance with limited labeled data, surpassing state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods while approaching fully supervised performance levels.

In this work, we propose two novel deep learning architectures called LNU-Net and IBU-Net for left ventricle segmentation from short-axis cine MRI images. LNU-Net is derived from layer normalization (LN) U-Net architecture, while IBU-Net is derived from the instance-batch normalized (IB) U-Net for medical image segmentation. The architectures of LNU-Net and IBU-Net have a down-sampling path for feature extraction and an up-sampling path for precise localization. We use the original U-Net as the basic segmentation approach and compared it with our proposed architectures. Both LNU-Net and IBU-Net have left ventricle segmentation methods: LNU-Net applies layer normalization in each convolutional block, while IBU-Net incorporates instance and batch normalization together in the first convolutional block and passes its result to the next layer. Our method incorporates affine transformations and elastic deformations for image data processing. Our dataset that contains 805 MRI images regarding the left ventricle from 45 patients is used for evaluation. We experimentally evaluate the results of the proposed approaches outperforming the dice coefficient and the average perpendicular distance than other state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 5 figures, published in ICBBB 2022</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduced Med-2D SegNet, a novel and highly efficient segmentation architecture that delivers outstanding accuracy while maintaining a minimal computational footprint. Med-2D SegNet achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including KVASIR-SEG, PH2, EndoVis, and GLAS, with an average Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) of 89.77% across 20 diverse datasets. Central to its success is the compact Med Block, a specialized encoder design that incorporates dimension expansion and parameter reduction, enabling precise feature extraction while keeping model parameters to a low count of just 2.07 million. Med-2D SegNet excels in cross-dataset generalization, particularly in polyp segmentation, where it was trained on KVASIR-SEG and showed strong performance on unseen datasets, demonstrating its robustness in zero-shot learning scenarios, even though we acknowledge that further improvements are possible. With top-tier performance in both binary and multi-class segmentation, Med-2D SegNet redefines the balance between accuracy and efficiency, setting a new benchmark for medical image analysis. This work paves the way for developing accessible, high-performance diagnostic tools suitable for clinical environments and resource-constrained settings, making it a step forward in the democratization of advanced medical technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test-time generative augmentation for medical image segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17608v2)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is critical for clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and monitoring, yet segmentation models often struggle with uncertainties stemming from occlusions, ambiguous boundaries, and variations in imaging devices. Traditional test-time augmentation (TTA) techniques typically rely on predefined geometric and photometric transformations, limiting their adaptability and effectiveness in complex medical scenarios. In this study, we introduced Test-Time Generative Augmentation (TTGA), a novel augmentation strategy specifically tailored for medical image segmentation at inference time. Different from conventional augmentation strategies that suffer from excessive randomness or limited flexibility, TTGA leverages a domain-fine-tuned generative model to produce contextually relevant and diverse augmentations tailored to the characteristics of each test image. Built upon diffusion model inversion, a masked null-text inversion method is proposed to enable region-specific augmentations during sampling. Furthermore, a dual denoising pathway is designed to balance precise identity preservation with controlled variability. We demonstrate the efficacy of our TTGA through extensive experiments across three distinct segmentation tasks spanning nine datasets. Our results consistently demonstrate that TTGA not only improves segmentation accuracy (with DSC gains ranging from 0.1% to 2.3% over the baseline) but also offers pixel-wise error estimation (with DSC gains ranging from 1.1% to 29.0% over the baseline). The source code and demonstration are available at: https://github.com/maxiao0234/TTGA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Medical Image Analysis (MedIA).

However, robust segmentation remains a challenge in complex scenarios. To address this, this paper proposes a cascaded convolutional neural network integrated with a novel Global Information Guidance Module. This module is designed to effectively fuse low-level texture details with high-level semantic features across multiple layers, thereby overcoming the inherent limitations of single-scale feature extraction. This architectural innovation significantly enhances segmentation accuracy, particularly in visually cluttered or blurred environments where traditional methods often fail. Experimental evaluations on benchmark image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior precision, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of the approach and its promising potential for deployment in practical robotic applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaFormer-driven Encoding Network for Robust Medical Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00922v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation is crucial for medical image analysis, enabling precise disease diagnosis and treatment planning. However, many advanced models employ complex architectures, limiting their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. This paper proposes MFEnNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework that incorporates MetaFormer in the encoding phase of the U-Net backbone. MetaFormer, an architectural abstraction of vision transformers, provides a versatile alternative to convolutional neural networks by transforming tokenized image patches into sequences for global context modeling. To mitigate the substantial computational cost associated with self-attention, the proposed framework replaces conventional transformer modules with pooling transformer blocks, thereby achieving effective global feature aggregation at reduced complexity. In addition, Swish activation is used to achieve smoother gradients and faster convergence, while spatial pyramid pooling is incorporated at the bottleneck to improve multi-scale feature extraction. Comprehensive experiments on different medical segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed MFEnNet approach attains competitive accuracy while significantly lowering computational cost compared to state-of-the-art models.

| **[Towards Generalisable Foundation Models for Brain MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23415v3)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms. It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.</p></details> |  |

However, adapting SAM2 to MIS presents several challenges, including the need for extensive annotated medical data for fine-tuning and high-quality manual prompts, which are both labor-intensive and require intervention from medical experts. To address these challenges, we introduce OFL-SAM2, a prompt-free SAM2 framework for label-efficient MIS. Our core idea is to leverage limited annotated samples to train a lightweight mapping network that captures medical knowledge and transforms generic image features into target features, thereby providing additional discriminative target representations for each frame and eliminating the need for manual prompts. Crucially, the mapping network supports online parameter update during inference, enhancing the model's generalization across test sequences. Technically, we introduce two key components: (1) an online few-shot learner that trains the mapping network to generate target features using limited data, and (2) an adaptive fusion module that dynamically integrates the target features with the memory-attention features generated by frozen SAM2, leading to accurate and robust target representation. Extensive experiments on three diverse MIS datasets demonstrate that OFL-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art performance with limited training data.</p></details> |  |

While foundation models pre-trained on large remote sensing datasets show promise, their learned representations often fail to transfer to domain-specific applications like close-range agricultural monitoring where spectral signatures, spatial scales, and semantic targets differ fundamentally. This report presents Deep Global Clustering (DGC), a conceptual framework for memory-efficient HSI segmentation that learns global clustering structure from local patch observations without pre-training. DGC operates on small patches with overlapping regions to enforce consistency, enabling training in under 30 minutes on consumer hardware while maintaining constant memory usage. On a leaf disease dataset, DGC achieves background-tissue separation (mean IoU 0.925) and demonstrates unsupervised disease detection through navigable semantic granularity. However, the framework suffers from optimization instability rooted in multi-objective loss balancing: meaningful representations emerge rapidly but degrade due to cluster over-merging in feature space. We position this work as intellectual scaffolding - the design philosophy has merit, but stable implementation requires principled approaches to dynamic loss balancing.

By applying a new general data transformation, that randomly perturbs multiple times the PCA subspace projection of a test input, GTTA creates valid augmented samples from the data distribution with high diversity, properties we theoretically show that are essential for a Test-Time Augmentation method to be effective. Different from other existing methods, we also propose a final self-supervised learning stage in which the ensemble output, acting as an unsupervised teacher, is used to train the initial single student model, thus reducing significantly the test time computational cost. Our comparisons to strong TTA approaches and SoTA models on various vision and non-vision well-known datasets and tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, pneumonia detection, speech recognition and house price prediction, validate the generality of the proposed GTTA. Furthermore, we also prove its effectiveness on the more specific real-world task of salmon segmentation and detection in low-visibility underwater videos, for which we introduce DeepSalmon, the largest dataset of its kind in the literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[GCA-ResUNet: Medical Image Segmentation Using Grouped Coordinate Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23990v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate segmentation of heterogeneous anatomical structures is pivotal for computer-aided diagnosis and subsequent clinical decision-making. Although U-Net based convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable progress, their intrinsic locality and largely homogeneous attention formulations often limit the modeling of long-range contextual dependencies, especially in multi-organ scenarios and low-contrast regions. Transformer-based architectures mitigate this issue by leveraging global self-attention, but they usually require higher computational resources and larger training data, which may impede deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments.In this paper, we propose GCA-ResUNet, an efficient medical image segmentation framework equipped with a lightweight and plug-and-play Grouped Coordinate Attention (GCA) module. The proposed GCA decouples channel-wise context modeling into multiple groups to explicitly account for semantic heterogeneity across channels, and integrates direction-aware coordinate encoding to capture structured spatial dependencies along horizontal and vertical axes. This design enhances global representation capability while preserving the efficiency advantages of CNN backbones. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmarks, Synapse and ACDC, demonstrate that GCA-ResUNet achieves Dice scores of 86.11% and 92.64%, respectively, outperforming a range of representative CNN and Transformer-based methods, including Swin-UNet and TransUNet. In particular, GCA-ResUNet yields consistent improvements in delineating small anatomical structures with complex boundaries. These results indicate that the proposed approach provides a favorable trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical and scalable solution for clinical deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Class Incremental Medical Image Segmentation via Prototype-Guided Calibration and Dual-Aligned Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07749v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class incremental medical image segmentation (CIMIS) aims to preserve knowledge of previously learned classes while learning new ones without relying on old-class labels. However, existing methods 1) either adopt one-size-fits-all strategies that treat all spatial regions and feature channels equally, which may hinder the preservation of accurate old knowledge, 2) or focus solely on aligning local prototypes with global ones for old classes while overlooking their local representations in new data, leading to knowledge degradation. To mitigate the above issues, we propose Prototype-Guided Calibration Distillation (PGCD) and Dual-Aligned Prototype Distillation (DAPD) for CIMIS in this paper. Specifically, PGCD exploits prototype-to-feature similarity to calibrate class-specific distillation intensity in different spatial regions, effectively reinforcing reliable old knowledge and suppressing misleading information from old classes. Complementarily, DAPD aligns the local prototypes of old classes extracted from the current model with both global prototypes and local prototypes, further enhancing segmentation performance on old categories. Comprehensive evaluations on two widely used multi-organ segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its robustness and generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MedSAM-based lung masking for multi-label chest X-ray classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23089v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment for Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22981v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-guided Medical Image Segmentation has shown considerable promise for medical image segmentation, with rich clinical text serving as an effective supplement for scarce data. However, current methods have two key bottlenecks. On one hand, they struggle to process diagnostic and descriptive texts simultaneously, making it difficult to identify lesions and establish associations with image regions. On the other hand, existing approaches focus on lesions description and fail to capture positional constraints, leading to critical deviations. Specifically, with the text "in the left lower lung", the segmentation results may incorrectly cover both sides of the lung. To address the limitations, we propose the Spatial-aware Symmetric Alignment (SSA) framework to enhance the capacity of referring hybrid medical texts consisting of locational, descriptive, and diagnostic information. Specifically, we propose symmetric optimal transport alignment mechanism to strengthen the associations between image regions and multiple relevant expressions, which establishes bi-directional fine-grained multimodal correspondences. In addition, we devise a composite directional guidance strategy that explicitly introduces spatial constraints in the text by constructing region-level guidance masks. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate that SSA achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, particularly in accurately segmenting lesions characterized by spatial relational constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwinTF3D: A Lightweight Multimodal Fusion Approach for Text-Guided 3D Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22878v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent integration of artificial intelligence into medical imaging has driven remarkable advances in automated organ segmentation. However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Split4D: Decomposed 4D Scene Reconstruction Without Video Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22745v1)** | 2025-12-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of decomposed 4D scene reconstruction from multi-view videos. Recent methods achieve this by lifting video segmentation results to a 4D representation through differentiable rendering techniques. Therefore, they heavily rely on the quality of video segmentation maps, which are often unstable, leading to unreliable reconstruction results. To overcome this challenge, our key idea is to represent the decomposed 4D scene with the Freetime FeatureGS and design a streaming feature learning strategy to accurately recover it from per-image segmentation maps, eliminating the need for video segmentation. Freetime FeatureGS models the dynamic scene as a set of Gaussian primitives with learnable features and linear motion ability, allowing them to move to neighboring regions over time. We apply a contrastive loss to Freetime FeatureGS, forcing primitive features to be close or far apart based on whether their projections belong to the same instance in the 2D segmentation map. As our Gaussian primitives can move across time, it naturally extends the feature learning to the temporal dimension, achieving 4D segmentation. Furthermore, we sample observations for training in a temporally ordered manner, enabling the streaming propagation of features over time and effectively avoiding local minima during the optimization process. Experimental results on several datasets show that the reconstruction quality of our method outperforms recent methods by a large margin.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods typically filter out domain-specific information to improve generalization, which inadvertently limits cross-domain performance and degrades source-domain accuracy. To address this, we present Contrastive Graph Modeling (C-Graph), a framework that leverages the structural consistency of medical images as a reliable domain-transferable prior. We represent image features as graphs, with pixels as nodes and semantic affinities as edges. A Structural Prior Graph (SPG) layer is proposed to capture and transfer target-category node dependencies and enable global structure modeling through explicit node interactions. Building upon SPG layers, we introduce a Subgraph Matching Decoding (SMD) mechanism that exploits semantic relations among nodes to guide prediction. Furthermore, we design a Confusion-minimizing Node Contrast (CNC) loss to mitigate node ambiguity and subgraph heterogeneity by contrastively enhancing node discriminability in the graph space. Our method significantly outperforms prior CD-FSMIS approaches across multiple cross-domain benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance while simultaneously preserving strong segmentation accuracy on the source domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (T-MI), 2026</p></details> |

Dermoscopic skin lesion imaging allows human experts and AI systems to observe morphological structures otherwise not discernable from regular clinical photographs. However, currently there are no large-scale publicly available multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation (SLS) datasets with annotator-labels for dermoscopic skin lesion imaging. We introduce ISIC MultiAnnot++, a large public multi-annotator skin lesion segmentation dataset for images from the ISIC Archive. The final dataset contains 17,684 segmentation masks spanning 14,967 dermoscopic images, where 2,394 dermoscopic images have 2-5 segmentations per image, making it the largest publicly available SLS dataset. Further, metadata about the segmentation, including the annotators' skill level and segmentation tool, is included, enabling research on topics such as annotator-specific preference modeling for segmentation and annotator metadata analysis. We provide an analysis on the characteristics of this dataset, curated data partitions, and consensus segmentation masks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 7 figures |

Self-distillation recently is emerging as a promising approach for fine-tuning VLMs to better adapt to local regions without requiring extensive annotations. However, previous state-of-the-art approaches often suffer from significant `foreground bias', where models tend to wrongly identify background regions as foreground objects. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. To alleviate this issue, we propose DenseVLM, a framework designed to learn unbiased region-language alignment from powerful pre-trained VLM representations. DenseVLM leverages the pre-trained VLM to retrieve categories for unlabeled regions and then decouples the interference between foreground and background features. We show that DenseVLM can directly replace the original VLM in open-vocabulary object detection and image segmentation methods, leading to notable performance improvements.

However, existing methods typically rely on unaligned image and text encoders, which necessitate complex interaction modules for multimodal fusion. While CLIP provides a pre-aligned multimodal feature space, its direct application to medical imaging is limited by three main issues: insufficient preservation of fine-grained anatomical structures, inadequate modeling of complex clinical descriptions, and domain-specific semantic misalignment. To tackle these challenges, we propose TGC-Net, a CLIP-based framework focusing on parameter-efficient, task-specific adaptations. Specifically, it incorporates a Semantic-Structural Synergy Encoder (SSE) that augments CLIP's ViT with a CNN branch for multi-scale structural refinement, a Domain-Augmented Text Encoder (DATE) that injects large-language-model-derived medical knowledge, and a Vision-Language Calibration Module (VLCM) that refines cross-modal correspondence in a unified feature space. Experiments on five datasets across chest X-ray and thoracic CT modalities demonstrate that TGC-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance with substantially fewer trainable parameters, including notable Dice gains on challenging benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

While few-shot segmentation methods can learn from minimal examples, existing approaches demonstrate suboptimal performance in precise boundary delineation for medical images, particularly when anatomically similar regions appear without sufficient spatial context. We propose AGENet (Adaptive Geodesic Edge-aware Network), a novel framework that incorporates spatial relationships through edge-aware geodesic distance learning. Our key insight is that medical structures follow predictable geometric patterns that can guide prototype extraction even with limited training data. Unlike methods relying on complex architectural components or heavy neural networks, our approach leverages computationally lightweight geometric modeling. The framework combines three main components: (1) An edge-aware geodesic distance learning module that respects anatomical boundaries through iterative Fast Marching refinement, (2) adaptive prototype extraction that captures both global structure and local boundary details via spatially-weighted aggregation, and (3) adaptive parameter learning that automatically adjusts to different organ characteristics. Extensive experiments across diverse medical imaging datasets demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Notably, our method reduces boundary errors compared to existing approaches while maintaining computational efficiency, making it highly suitable for clinical applications requiring precise segmentation with limited annotated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in WACV 2026 (Round 2)</p></details> |

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Existing approaches either suppress blur as noise and lose discriminative structure, or apply full image restoration that increases latency and limits deployment on resource constrained devices. We propose DFRCP, a Dynamic Fuzzy Robust Convolutional Pyramid, as a plug in upgrade to YOLOv11 for blur robust detection. DFRCP enhances the YOLOv11 feature pyramid by combining large scale and medium scale features while preserving native representations, and by introducing Dynamic Robust Switch units that adaptively inject fuzzy features to strengthen global perception under jitter. Fuzzy features are synthesized by rotating and nonlinearly interpolating multiscale features, then merged through a transparency convolution that learns a content adaptive trade off between original and fuzzy cues. We further develop a CUDA parallel rotation and interpolation kernel that avoids boundary overflow and delivers more than 400 times speedup, making the design practical for edge deployment. We train with paired supervision on a private wheat pest damage dataset of about 3,500 images, augmented threefold using two blur regimes, uniform image wide motion blur and bounding box confined rotational blur. On blurred test sets, YOLOv11 with DFRCP achieves about 10.4 percent higher accuracy than the YOLOv11 baseline with only a modest training time overhead, reducing the need for manual filtering after data collection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Efficient 3D Object Detection for Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaboration via Risk-Intent Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03001v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vehicle-Infrastructure Collaborative Perception (VICP) is pivotal for resolving occlusion in autonomous driving, yet the trade-off between communication bandwidth and feature redundancy remains a critical bottleneck. While intermediate fusion mitigates data volume compared to raw sharing, existing frameworks typically rely on spatial compression or static confidence maps, which inefficiently transmit spatially redundant features from non-critical background regions. To address this, we propose Risk-intent Selective detection (RiSe), an interaction-aware framework that shifts the paradigm from identifying visible regions to prioritizing risk-critical ones. Specifically, we introduce a Potential Field-Trajectory Correlation Model (PTCM) grounded in potential field theory to quantitatively assess kinematic risks. Complementing this, an Intention-Driven Area Prediction Module (IDAPM) leverages ego-motion priors to proactively predict and filter key Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) areas essential for decision-making. By integrating these components, RiSe implements a semantic-selective fusion scheme that transmits high-fidelity features only from high-interaction regions, effectively acting as a feature denoiser. Extensive experiments on the DeepAccident dataset demonstrate that our method reduces communication volume to 0.71\% of full feature sharing while maintaining state-of-the-art detection accuracy, establishing a competitive Pareto frontier between bandwidth efficiency and perception performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Augmented Reality for RObots (ARRO): Pointing Visuomotor Policies Towards Visual Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08627v3)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visuomotor policies trained on human expert demonstrations have recently shown strong performance across a wide range of robotic manipulation tasks. However, these policies remain highly sensitive to domain shifts stemming from background or robot embodiment changes, which limits their generalization capabilities. In this paper, we present ARRO, a novel visual representation that leverages zero-shot open-vocabulary segmentation and object detection models to efficiently mask out task-irrelevant regions of the scene in real time without requiring additional training, modeling of the setup, or camera calibration. By filtering visual distractors and overlaying virtual guides during both training and inference, ARRO improves robustness to scene variations and reduces the need for additional data collection. We extensively evaluate ARRO with Diffusion Policy on a range of tabletop manipulation tasks in both simulation and real-world environments, and further demonstrate its compatibility and effectiveness with generalist robot policies, such as Octo, OpenVLA and Pi Zero. Across all settings in our evaluation, ARRO yields consistent performance gains, allows for selective masking to choose between different objects, and shows robustness even to challenging segmentation conditions.

Distinguished from existing approaches that primarily rely on sparse prompts (e.g., points or boxes), our method introduces a holistic mechanism for constructing and propagating dense depth prompts. Specifically, we propose a Cross-modal Graph Enhancement (CGE) module that synthesizes RGB semantics and depth geometric within a heterogeneous graph to form a unified guidance signal. Furthermore, we design an Anchor-Guided Refinement (AGR) module. To counteract the inherent information decay in feature hierarchies, AGR forges a global anchor and establishes direct non-local pathways to broadcast this guidance from deep to shallow layers, ensuring precise and consistent segmentation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DGA-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art COD methods.</p></details> |  |

However, due to the extremely limited pixel information and significant variations in object density, mainstream Transformer-based detectors often suffer from slow convergence and inaccurate query-object matching. To address these challenges, we propose D$^3$R-DETR, a novel DETR-based detector with Dual-Domain Density Refinement. By fusing spatial and frequency domain information, our method refines low-level feature maps and utilizes their rich details to predict more accurate object density map, thereby guiding the model to precisely localize tiny objects. Extensive experiments on the AI-TOD-v2 dataset demonstrate that D$^3$R-DETR outperforms existing state-of-the-art detectors for tiny object detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap). In addition to these contributions, we provide an extensive benchmark of state-of-the-art object detection models, detailing their results with respect to the hardness level assessed by the proposed metric. Despite achieving promising results (mAP of 59.7% in the plastic-only detection task), performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes. This highlights the need for novel and more challenging datasets on the topic.</p></details> | 9 pages |
| **[SLGNet: Synergizing Structural Priors and Language-Guided Modulation for Multimodal Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02249v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal object detection leveraging RGB and Infrared (IR) images is pivotal for robust perception in all-weather scenarios. While recent adapter-based approaches efficiently transfer RGB-pretrained foundation models to this task, they often prioritize model efficiency at the expense of cross-modal structural consistency. Consequently, critical structural cues are frequently lost when significant domain gaps arise, such as in high-contrast or nighttime environments. Moreover, conventional static multimodal fusion mechanisms typically lack environmental awareness, resulting in suboptimal adaptation and constrained detection performance under complex, dynamic scene variations. To address these limitations, we propose SLGNet, a parameter-efficient framework that synergizes hierarchical structural priors and language-guided modulation within a frozen Vision Transformer (ViT)-based foundation model. Specifically, we design a Structure-Aware Adapter to extract hierarchical structural representations from both modalities and dynamically inject them into the ViT to compensate for structural degradation inherent in ViT-based backbones. Furthermore, we propose a Language-Guided Modulation module that exploits VLM-driven structured captions to dynamically recalibrate visual features, thereby endowing the model with robust environmental awareness. Extensive experiments on the LLVIP, FLIR, KAIST, and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that SLGNet establishes new state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on the LLVIP benchmark, our method achieves an mAP of 66.1, while reducing trainable parameters by approximately 87% compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This confirms SLGNet as a robust and efficient solution for multimodal perception.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on GitHub: https://github.com/mbar0075/lupi-for-object-detection</p></details> |

Existing methods with fixed mask ratio neglect multi-level representational correlations and intrinsic geometric structures, while relying on point-wise reconstruction assumptions that conflict with the diversity of point cloud. To address these issues, we propose a 3D representation learning method, termed Point-SRA, which aligns representations through self-distillation and probabilistic modeling. Specifically, we assign different masking ratios to the MAE to capture complementary geometric and semantic information, while the MeanFlow Transformer (MFT) leverages cross-modal conditional embeddings to enable diverse probabilistic reconstruction. Our analysis further reveals that representations at different time steps in MFT also exhibit complementarity. Therefore, a Dual Self-Representation Alignment mechanism is proposed at both the MAE and MFT levels. Finally, we design a Flow-Conditioned Fine-Tuning Architecture to fully exploit the point cloud distribution learned via MeanFlow. Point-SRA outperforms Point-MAE by 5.37% on ScanObjectNN. On intracranial aneurysm segmentation, it reaches 96.07% mean IoU for arteries and 86.87% for aneurysms. For 3D object detection, Point-SRA achieves 47.3% AP@50, surpassing MaskPoint by 5.12%.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an AAAI 2026 accepted paper titled "Point-SRA: Self-Representation Alignment for 3D Representation Learning", spanning 13 pages in total.

Detecting small objects under complex conditions, however, remains a significant challenge.To address this, we present DGE-YOLO, an enhanced YOLO-based detection framework designed to effectively fuse multi-modal information. We introduce a dual-branch architecture for modality-specific feature extraction, enabling the model to process both infrared and visible images. To further enrich semantic representation, we propose an Efficient Multi-scale Attention (EMA) mechanism that enhances feature learning across spatial scales. Additionally, we replace the conventional neck with a Gather-and-Distribute(GD) module to mitigate information loss during feature aggregation. Extensive experiments on the Drone Vehicle dataset demonstrate that DGE-YOLO achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, validating its effectiveness in multi-modal UAV object detection tasks.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

However, real deployment often requires annotation of roadside-only data due to hardware and privacy constraints. Even human experts struggle to produce accurate labels without vehicle-side data (image, LIDAR), which not only increases annotation difficulty and cost, but also reveals a fundamental learnability problem: many roadside-only scenes contain distant, blurred, or occluded objects whose 3D properties are ambiguous from a single view and can only be reliably annotated by cross-checking paired vehicle--roadside frames. We refer to such cases as inherently ambiguous samples. To reduce wasted annotation effort on inherently ambiguous samples while still obtaining high-performing models, we turn to active learning. This work focuses on active learning for roadside monocular 3D object detection and proposes a learnability-driven framework that selects scenes which are both informative and reliably labelable, suppressing inherently ambiguous samples while ensuring coverage. Experiments demonstrate that our method, LH3D, achieves 86.06%, 67.32%, and 78.67% of full-performance for vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists respectively, using only 25% of the annotation budget on DAIR-V2X-I, significantly outperforming uncertainty-based baselines. This confirms that learnability, not uncertainty, matters for roadside 3D perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures.

The focus is on an intelligent surveillance system that detects unauthorized individuals in restricted areas by analyzing attire. Traditional security measures face challenges in monitoring unauthorized access. Leveraging YOLOv8, an advanced object detection algorithm, our system identifies authorized personnel based on their attire in CCTV footage. The methodology involves training the YOLOv8 model on a comprehensive dataset of uniform patterns, ensuring precise recognition in specific regions. Soft computing techniques enhance adaptability to dynamic environments and varying lighting conditions. This research contributes to image analysis and soft computing, providing a sophisticated security solution. Emphasizing uniform-based anomaly detection, it establishes a foundation for robust security systems in restricted areas. The outcomes highlight the potential of YOLOv8-based surveillance in ensuring safety in sensitive locations.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Since coastal scenarios are unpredictable and scenes have dynamic properties it is essential to apply detection methods that are robust to these conditions. This paper presents modified ViBe for moving object detection which detects ships and backwash. In the modified ViBe the probability of losing ships is decreased in comparison with the original ViBe. It is robust to natural sea waves and variation of lights and is capable of quickly updating the background. Based on geometrical properties of ship and some concepts such as brightness distortion, a new method for backwash cancellation is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed strategy and methods have outstanding performance in ship detection and tracking. These results also illustrate real time and precise performance of the proposed strategy.</p></details> |  |
| **[RFAssigner: A Generic Label Assignment Strategy for Dense Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01240v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Label assignment is a critical component in training dense object detectors. State-of-the-art methods typically assign each training sample a positive and a negative weight, optimizing the assignment scheme during training. However, these strategies often assign an insufficient number of positive samples to small objects, leading to a scale imbalance during training. To address this limitation, we introduce RFAssigner, a novel assignment strategy designed to enhance the multi-scale learning capabilities of dense detectors. RFAssigner first establishes an initial set of positive samples using a point-based prior. It then leverages a Gaussian Receptive Field (GRF) distance to measure the similarity between the GRFs of unassigned candidate locations and the ground-truth objects. Based on this metric, RFAssigner adaptively selects supplementary positive samples from the unassigned pool, promoting a more balanced learning process across object scales. Comprehensive experiments on three datasets with distinct object scale distributions validate the effectiveness and generalizability of our method. Notably, a single FCOS-ResNet-50 detector equipped with RFAssigner achieves state-of-the-art performance across all object scales, consistently outperforming existing strategies without requiring auxiliary modules or heuristics.</p></details> |  |

However, high-quality and large-scale camouflage datasets with dense annotation remain scarce due to expensive data collection and labeling costs. To address this challenge, we explore leveraging generative models to synthesize realistic camouflage image-dense data for training CDP models with fine-grained representations, prior knowledge, and auxiliary reasoning. Concretely, our contributions are threefold: (i) we introduce GenCAMO-DB, a large-scale camouflage dataset with multi-modal annotations, including depth maps, scene graphs, attribute descriptions, and text prompts; (ii) we present GenCAMO, an environment-aware and mask-free generative framework that produces high-fidelity camouflage image-dense annotations; (iii) extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that GenCAMO significantly improves dense prediction performance on complex camouflage scenes by providing high-quality synthetic data. The code and datasets will be released after paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |

The datasets span binary classification, fine-grained multiclass recognition, and object detection scenarios. We analyze how architectural factors, such as network depth, residual connections, and feature extraction strategies, influence classification and localization performance. The results show that deeper CNN architectures provide substantial performance gains on fine-grained multiclass datasets, while lightweight pretrained and transfer learning models remain highly effective for simpler binary classification tasks. Additionally, we extend the proposed architecture to an object detection setting, demonstrating its adaptability in identifying unauthorized auto-rickshaws in real-world traffic scenes. Building upon a systematic analysis of custom CNN architectures alongside pretrained and transfer learning models, this study provides practical guidance for selecting suitable network designs based on task complexity and resource constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Dual-Weighted Gravitational Point Cloud Denoising Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10386v2)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality point cloud data is a critical foundation for tasks such as autonomous driving and 3D reconstruction. However, LiDAR-based point cloud acquisition is often affected by various disturbances, resulting in a large number of noise points that degrade the accuracy of subsequent point cloud object detection and recognition. Moreover, existing point cloud denoising methods typically sacrifice computational efficiency in pursuit of higher denoising accuracy, or, conversely, improve processing speed at the expense of preserving object boundaries and fine structural details, making it difficult to simultaneously achieve high denoising accuracy, strong edge preservation, and real-time performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes an adaptive dualweight gravitational-based point cloud denoising method. First, an octree is employed to perform spatial partitioning of the global point cloud, enabling parallel acceleration. Then, within each leaf node, adaptive voxel-based occupancy statistics and k-nearest neighbor (kNN) density estimation are applied to rapidly remove clearly isolated and low-density noise points, thereby reducing the effective candidate set. Finally, a gravitational scoring function that combines density weights with adaptive distance weights is constructed to finely distinguish noise points from object points. Experiments conducted on the Stanford 3D Scanning Repository, the Canadian Adverse Driving Conditions (CADC) dataset, and in-house RUBY PLUS LiDAR point clouds acquired in our laboratory demonstrate that, compared with existing methods, the proposed approach achieves consistent improvements in F1, PSNR, and Chamfer Distance (CD) across various noise conditions while reducing the single-frame processing time, thereby validating its high accuracy, robustness, and real-time performance in multi-noise scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mono3DV: Monocular 3D Object Detection with 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching and Variational Query DeNoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01036v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While DETR-like architectures have demonstrated significant potential for monocular 3D object detection, they are often hindered by a critical limitation: the exclusion of 3D attributes from the bipartite matching process. This exclusion arises from the inherent ill-posed nature of 3D estimation from monocular image, which introduces instability during training. Consequently, high-quality 3D predictions can be erroneously suppressed by 2D-only matching criteria, leading to suboptimal results. To address this, we propose Mono3DV, a novel Transformer-based framework. Our approach introduces three key innovations. First, we develop a 3D-Aware Bipartite Matching strategy that directly incorporates 3D geometric information into the matching cost, resolving the misalignment caused by purely 2D criteria. Second, it is important to stabilize the Bipartite Matching to resolve the instability occurring when integrating 3D attributes. Therefore, we propose 3D-DeNoising scheme in the training phase. Finally, recognizing the gradient vanishing issue associated with conventional denoising techniques, we propose a novel Variational Query DeNoising mechanism to overcome this limitation, which significantly enhances model performance. Without leveraging any external data, our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark.</p></details> |  |

In this study, we aim to evaluate the performance of existing models on open-vocabulary object detection tasks under low-quality image conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a new dataset that simulates low-quality images in the real world. In our evaluation experiment, we find that although open-vocabulary object detection models exhibited no significant decrease in mAP scores under low-level image degradation, the performance of all models dropped sharply under high-level image degradation. OWLv2 models consistently performed better across different types of degradation, while OWL-ViT, GroundingDINO, and Detic showed significant performance declines.

We demonstrate that tiny objects are highly sensitive to annotation noise, where optimizing strict localization objectives risks noise overfitting. To address this, we propose Tiny Object Localization with Flows (TOLF), a noise-robust localization framework leveraging normalizing flows for flexible error modeling and uncertainty-guided optimization. Our method captures complex, non-Gaussian prediction distributions through flow-based error modeling, enabling robust learning under noisy supervision. An uncertainty-aware gradient modulation mechanism further suppresses learning from high-uncertainty, noise-prone samples, mitigating overfitting while stabilizing training. Extensive experiments across three datasets validate our approach's effectiveness. Especially, TOLF boosts the DINO baseline by 1.2% AP on the AI-TOD dataset.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

Existing vision datasets for litter detection focus on street-level still images, aerial scenes or aquatic environments, and do not reflect the unique characteristics of dashcam footage, where litter appears extremely small, sparse and embedded in cluttered road-verge backgrounds. We introduce RoLID-11K, the first large-scale dataset for roadside litter detection from dashcams, comprising over 11k annotated images spanning diverse UK driving conditions and exhibiting pronounced long-tail and small-object distributions. We benchmark a broad spectrum of modern detectors, from accuracy-oriented transformer architectures to real-time YOLO models, and analyse their strengths and limitations on this challenging task. Our results show that while CO-DETR and related transformers achieve the best localisation accuracy, real-time models remain constrained by coarse feature hierarchies. RoLID-11K establishes a challenging benchmark for extreme small-object detection in dynamic driving scenes and aims to support the development of scalable, low-cost systems for roadside-litter monitoring.

In this paper, we first identify three primary types of knowledge conflicts that contribute to catastrophic forgetting in YOLO-based incremental detectors: foreground-background confusion, parameter interference, and misaligned knowledge distillation. Subsequently, we introduce YOLO-IOD, a real-time Incremental Object Detection (IOD) framework that is constructed upon the pretrained YOLO-World model, facilitating incremental learning via a stage-wise parameter-efficient fine-tuning process. Specifically, YOLO-IOD encompasses three principal components: 1) Conflict-Aware Pseudo-Label Refinement (CPR), which mitigates the foreground-background confusion by leveraging the confidence levels of pseudo labels and identifying potential objects relevant to future tasks. 2) Importancebased Kernel Selection (IKS), which identifies and updates the pivotal convolution kernels pertinent to the current task during the current learning stage. 3) Cross-Stage Asymmetric Knowledge Distillation (CAKD), which addresses the misaligned knowledge distillation conflict by transmitting the features of the student target detector through the detection heads of both the previous and current teacher detectors, thereby facilitating asymmetric distillation between existing and newly introduced categories. We further introduce LoCo COCO, a more realistic benchmark that eliminates data leakage across stages. Experiments on both conventional and LoCo COCO benchmarks show that YOLO-IOD achieves superior performance with minimal forgetting.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 accepted.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images. TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of a paper accepted for oral presentation at AIIDE 2025</p></details> |

After all, thousands of drivers use busy city roads every day, and only one can claim to be the first. The same holds for autonomous computer vision systems. The vast majority of the deployment area of an autonomous vision system will have been visited before. Yet, most autonomous vehicle vision systems act as if they are encountering each location for the first time. In this work, we present Compressed Map Priors (CMP), a simple but effective framework to learn spatial priors from historic traversals. The map priors use a binarized hashmap that requires only $32\text{KB}/\text{km}^2$, a $20\times$ reduction compared to the dense storage. Compressed Map Priors easily integrate into leading 3D perception systems at little to no extra computational costs, and lead to a significant and consistent improvement in 3D object detection on the nuScenes dataset across several architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tech ...</summary><p>Tech report; code https://github.com/bradyz/compressed_map_priors</p></details> |

While prior work has primarily focused on refining scoring functions and adjusting test-time thresholds, such algorithmic improvements offer only incremental gains. We argue that a rethinking of the entire development lifecycle is needed to mitigate these risks effectively. This work addresses two overlooked dimensions of OoD detection in object detection. First, we reveal fundamental flaws in widely used evaluation benchmarks: contrary to their design intent, up to 13% of objects in the OoD test sets actually belong to in-distribution classes, and vice versa. These quality issues severely distort the reported performance of existing methods and contribute to their high false positive rates. Second, we introduce a novel training-time mitigation paradigm that operates independently of external OoD detectors. Instead of relying solely on post-hoc scoring, we fine-tune the detector using a carefully synthesized OoD dataset that semantically resembles in-distribution objects. This process shapes a defensive decision boundary by suppressing objectness on OoD objects, leading to a 91% reduction in hallucination error of a YOLO model on BDD-100K. Our methodology generalizes across detection paradigms such as YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and RT-DETR, and supports few-shot adaptation. Together, these contributions offer a principled and effective way to reduce OoD-induced hallucination in object detectors.

| **[Towards Streaming LiDAR Object Detection with Point Clouds as Egocentric Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06944v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and low-latency 3D object detection is essential for autonomous driving, where safety hinges on both rapid response and reliable perception. While rotating LiDAR sensors are widely adopted for their robustness and fidelity, current detectors face a trade-off: streaming methods process partial polar sectors on the fly for fast updates but suffer from limited visibility, cross-sector dependencies, and distortions from retrofitted Cartesian designs, whereas full-scan methods achieve higher accuracy but are bottlenecked by the inherent latency of a LiDAR revolution. We propose Polar-Fast-Cartesian-Full (PFCF), a hybrid detector that combines fast polar processing for intra-sector feature extraction with accurate Cartesian reasoning for full-scene understanding. Central to PFCF is a custom Mamba SSM-based streaming backbone with dimensionally-decomposed convolutions that avoids distortion-heavy planes, enabling parameter-efficient, translation-invariant, and distortion-robust polar representation learning. Local sector features are extracted via this backbone, then accumulated into a sector feature buffer to enable efficient inter-sector communication through a full-scan backbone.

The orientation and spacing of transition lines in a charge stability diagram (CSD) contain a fingerprint of a QD device's capacitive environment, making these measurements useful tools for device characterization. However, manually interpreting these features is time-consuming, error-prone, and impractical at scale. Here, we present an automated protocol for extracting underlying capacitive properties from CSDs. Our method integrates machine learning, image processing, and object detection to identify and track charge transitions across large datasets without manual labeling. We demonstrate this method using experimentally measured data from a strained-germanium single-quantum-well (planar) and a strained-germanium double-quantum-well (bilayer) QD device. Unlike for planar QD devices, CSDs in bilayer germanium heterostructure exhibit a larger set of transitions, including interlayer tunneling and distinct loading lines for the vertically stacked QDs, making them a powerful testbed for automation methods. By analyzing the properties of many CSDs, we can statistically estimate physically relevant quantities, like relative lever arms and capacitive couplings. Thus, our protocol enables rapid extraction of useful, nontrivial information about QD devices.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

Recent research has advanced this topic significantly; however, many existing approaches remain inefficient due to their reliance on heavy foundation models. To address this limitation, we propose LOST-3DSG, a lightweight open-vocabulary 3D scene graph designed to track dynamic objects in real-world environments. Our method adopts a semantic approach to entity tracking based on word2vec and sentence embeddings, enabling an open-vocabulary representation while avoiding the necessity of storing dense CLIP visual features. As a result, LOST-3DSG achieves superior performance compared to approaches that rely on high-dimensional visual embeddings. We evaluate our method through qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted in a real 3D environment using a TIAGo robot. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of LOST-3DSG in dynamic object tracking. Code and supplementary material are publicly available on the project website at https://lab-rococo-sapienza.github.io/lost-3dsg/.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT Scans As Video: Efficient Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection Using Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02521v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated analysis of volumetric medical imaging on edge devices is severely constrained by the high memory and computational demands of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This paper develops a lightweight computer vision framework that reconciles the efficiency of 2D detection with the necessity of 3D context by reformulating volumetric Computer Tomography (CT) data as sequential video streams. This video-viewpoint paradigm is applied to the time-sensitive task of Intracranial Hemorrhage (ICH) detection using the Hemorica dataset. To ensure operational efficiency, we benchmarked multiple generations of the YOLO architecture (v8, v10, v11 and v12) in their Nano configurations, selecting the version with the highest mAP@50 to serve as the slice-level backbone. A ByteTrack algorithm is then introduced to enforce anatomical consistency across the $z$-axis. To address the initialization lag inherent in video trackers, a hybrid inference strategy and a spatiotemporal consistency filter are proposed to distinguish true pathology from transient prediction noise. Experimental results on independent test data demonstrate that the proposed framework serves as a rigorous temporal validator, increasing detection Precision from 0.703 to 0.779 compared to the baseline 2D detector, while maintaining high sensitivity. By approximating 3D contextual reasoning at a fraction of the computational cost, this method provides a scalable solution for real-time patient prioritization in resource-constrained environments, such as mobile stroke units and IoT-enabled remote clinics.</p></details> |  |
| **[AR-MOT: Autoregressive Multi-object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01925v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As multi-object tracking (MOT) tasks continue to evolve toward more general and multi-modal scenarios, the rigid and task-specific architectures of existing MOT methods increasingly hinder their applicability across diverse tasks and limit flexibility in adapting to new tracking formulations. Most approaches rely on fixed output heads and bespoke tracking pipelines, making them difficult to extend to more complex or instruction-driven tasks. To address these limitations, we propose AR-MOT, a novel autoregressive paradigm that formulates MOT as a sequence generation task within a large language model (LLM) framework. This design enables the model to output structured results through flexible sequence construction, without requiring any task-specific heads. To enhance region-level visual perception, we introduce an Object Tokenizer based on a pretrained detector. To mitigate the misalignment between global and regional features, we propose a Region-Aware Alignment (RAA) module, and to support long-term tracking, we design a Temporal Memory Fusion (TMF) module that caches historical object tokens. AR-MOT offers strong potential for extensibility, as new modalities or instructions can be integrated by simply modifying the output sequence format without altering the model architecture. Extensive experiments on MOT17 and DanceTrack validate the feasibility of our approach, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art methods while laying the foundation for more general and flexible MOT systems.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Decoupling Amplitude and Phase Attention in Frequency Domain for RGB-Event based Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01022v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing RGB-Event visual object tracking approaches primarily rely on conventional feature-level fusion, failing to fully exploit the unique advantages of event cameras. In particular, the high dynamic range and motion-sensitive nature of event cameras are often overlooked, while low-information regions are processed uniformly, leading to unnecessary computational overhead for the backbone network. To address these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework that performs early fusion in the frequency domain, enabling effective aggregation of high-frequency information from the event modality. Specifically, RGB and event modalities are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain via the Fast Fourier Transform, with their amplitude and phase components decoupled. High-frequency event information is selectively fused into RGB modality through amplitude and phase attention, enhancing feature representation while substantially reducing backbone computation. In addition, a motion-guided spatial sparsification module leverages the motion-sensitive nature of event cameras to capture the relationship between target motion cues and spatial probability distribution, filtering out low-information regions and enhancing target-relevant features. Finally, a sparse set of target-relevant features is fed into the backbone network for learning, and the tracking head predicts the final target position. Extensive experiments on three widely used RGB-Event tracking benchmark datasets, including FE108, FELT, and COESOT, demonstrate the high performance and efficiency of our method. The source code of this paper will be released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/OpenEvTracking</p></details> |  |
| **[CropTrack: A Tracking with Re-Identification Framework for Precision Agriculture](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24838v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple-object tracking (MOT) in agricultural environments presents major challenges due to repetitive patterns, similar object appearances, sudden illumination changes, and frequent occlusions. Contemporary trackers in this domain rely on the motion of objects rather than appearance for association. Nevertheless, they struggle to maintain object identities when targets undergo frequent and strong occlusions. The high similarity of object appearances makes integrating appearance-based association nontrivial for agricultural scenarios. To solve this problem we propose CropTrack, a novel MOT framework based on the combination of appearance and motion information. CropTrack integrates a reranking-enhanced appearance association, a one-to-many association with appearance-based conflict resolution strategy, and an exponential moving average prototype feature bank to improve appearance-based association. Evaluated on publicly available agricultural MOT datasets, CropTrack demonstrates consistent identity preservation, outperforming traditional motion-based tracking methods. Compared to the state of the art, CropTrack achieves significant gains in identification F1 and association accuracy scores with a lower number of identity switches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Memory Design in SAM-Based Visual Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22624v1)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>\noindent Memory has become the central mechanism enabling robust visual object tracking in modern segmentation-based frameworks. Recent methods built upon Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) have demonstrated strong performance by refining how past observations are stored and reused. However, existing approaches address memory limitations in a method-specific manner, leaving the broader design principles of memory in SAM-based tracking poorly understood. Moreover, it remains unclear how these memory mechanisms transfer to stronger, next-generation foundation models such as Segment Anything Model 3 (SAM3). In this work, we present a systematic memory-centric study of SAM-based visual object tracking. We first analyze representative SAM2-based trackers and show that most methods primarily differ in how short-term memory frames are selected, while sharing a common object-centric representation. Building on this insight, we faithfully reimplement these memory mechanisms within the SAM3 framework and conduct large-scale evaluations across ten diverse benchmarks, enabling a controlled analysis of memory design independent of backbone strength. Guided by our empirical findings, we propose a unified hybrid memory framework that explicitly decomposes memory into short-term appearance memory and long-term distractor-resolving memory. This decomposition enables the integration of existing memory policies in a modular and principled manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently improves robustness under long-term occlusion, complex motion, and distractor-heavy scenarios on both SAM2 and SAM3 backbones.

We propose a novel way to adapt them for online use, enabling real-time 6-DoF pose tracking and online reconstruction of objects and scenes from monocular RGB videos. Our method rapidly selects and manages a set of images as keyframes to map a scene or object via $π^3$ with full bidirectional attention. We then cache the global self-attention block's key-value (KV) pairs and use them as the sole scene representation for online tracking. This allows for up to $15\times$ speedup during inference without the fear of drift or catastrophic forgetting. Our caching strategy is model-agnostic and can be applied to other off-the-shelf multi-view networks without retraining. We demonstrate KV-Tracker on both scene-level tracking and the more challenging task of on-the-fly object tracking and reconstruction without depth measurements or object priors. Experiments on the TUM RGB-D, 7-Scenes, Arctic and OnePose datasets show the strong performance of our system while maintaining high frame-rates up to ${\sim}27$ FPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://marwan99.github.io/kv_tracker</p></details> |
| **[Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes.

| **[TrackTeller: Temporal Multimodal 3D Grounding for Behavior-Dependent Object References](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21641v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding natural-language references to objects in dynamic 3D driving scenes is essential for interactive autonomous systems. In practice, many referring expressions describe targets through recent motion or short-term interactions, which cannot be resolved from static appearance or geometry alone. We study temporal language-based 3D grounding, where the objective is to identify the referred object in the current frame by leveraging multi-frame observations. We propose TrackTeller, a temporal multimodal grounding framework that integrates LiDAR-image fusion, language-conditioned decoding, and temporal reasoning in a unified architecture. TrackTeller constructs a shared UniScene representation aligned with textual semantics, generates language-aware 3D proposals, and refines grounding decisions using motion history and short-term dynamics. Experiments on the NuPrompt benchmark demonstrate that TrackTeller consistently improves language-grounded tracking performance, outperforming strong baselines with a 70% relative improvement in Average Multi-Object Tracking Accuracy and a 3.15-3.4 times reduction in False Alarm Frequency.</p></details> |  |
| **[TrackNetV5: Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement and Motion Direction Decoupling for Fast Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02789v3)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The TrackNet series has established a strong baseline for fast-moving small object tracking in sports. However, existing iterations face significant limitations: V1-V3 struggle with occlusions due to a reliance on purely visual cues, while TrackNetV4, despite introducing motion inputs, suffers from directional ambiguity as its absolute difference method discards motion polarity. To overcome these bottlenecks, we propose TrackNetV5, a robust architecture integrating two novel mechanisms. First, to recover lost directional priors, we introduce the Motion Direction Decoupling (MDD) module. Unlike V4, MDD decomposes temporal dynamics into signed polarity fields, explicitly encoding both movement occurrence and trajectory direction. Second, we propose the Residual-Driven Spatio-Temporal Refinement (R-STR) head. Operating on a coarse-to-fine paradigm, this Transformer-based module leverages factorized spatio-temporal contexts to estimate a corrective residual, effectively recovering occluded targets. Extensive experiments on the TrackNetV2 dataset demonstrate that TrackNetV5 achieves a new state-of-the-art F1-score of 0.9859 and an accuracy of 0.9733, significantly outperforming previous versions. Notably, this performance leap is achieved with a marginal 3.7% increase in FLOPs compared to V4, maintaining real-time inference capabilities while delivering superior tracking precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[SPOT!: Map-Guided LLM Agent for Unsupervised Multi-CCTV Dynamic Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20975v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CCTV-based vehicle tracking systems face structural limitations in continuously connecting the trajectories of the same vehicle across multiple camera environments. In particular, blind spots occur due to the intervals between CCTVs and limited Fields of View (FOV), which leads to object ID switching and trajectory loss, thereby reducing the reliability of real-time path prediction. This paper proposes SPOT (Spatial Prediction Over Trajectories), a map-guided LLM agent capable of tracking vehicles even in blind spots of multi-CCTV environments without prior training. The proposed method represents road structures (Waypoints) and CCTV placement information as documents based on 2D spatial coordinates and organizes them through chunking techniques to enable real-time querying and inference. Furthermore, it transforms the vehicle's position into the actual world coordinate system using the relative position and FOV information of objects observed in CCTV images. By combining map spatial information with the vehicle's moving direction, speed, and driving patterns, a beam search is performed at the intersection level to derive candidate CCTV locations where the vehicle is most likely to enter after the blind spot. Experimental results based on the CARLA simulator in a virtual city environment confirmed that the proposed method accurately predicts the next appearing CCTV even in blind spot sections, maintaining continuous vehicle trajectories more effectively than existing techniques.</p></details> | 33 pages, 27figures |
| **[Failure Analysis of Safety Controllers in Autonomous Vehicles Under Object-Based LiDAR Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22244v1)** | 2025-12-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous vehicles rely on LiDAR based perception to support safety critical control functions such as adaptive cruise control and automatic emergency braking. While previous research has shown that LiDAR perception can be manipulated through object based spoofing and injection attacks, the impact of such attacks on vehicle safety controllers is still not well understood. This paper presents a systematic failure analysis of longitudinal safety controllers under object based LiDAR attacks in highway driving scenarios. The study focuses on realistic cut in and car following situations in which adversarial objects introduce persistent perception errors without directly modifying vehicle control software. A high fidelity simulation framework integrating LiDAR perception, object tracking, and closed loop vehicle control is used to evaluate how false and displaced object detections propagate through the perception planning and control pipeline. The results demonstrate that even short duration LiDAR induced object hallucinations can trigger unsafe braking, delayed responses to real hazards, and unstable control behavior. In cut in scenarios, a clear increase in unsafe deceleration events and time to collision violations is observed when compared to benign conditions, despite identical controller parameters. The analysis further shows that controller failures are more strongly influenced by the temporal consistency of spoofed objects than by spatial inaccuracies alone. These findings reveal a critical gap between perception robustness and control level safety guarantees in autonomous driving systems. By explicitly characterizing safety controller failure modes under adversarial perception, this work provides practical insights for the design of attack aware safety mechanisms and more resilient control strategies for LiDAR dependent autonomous vehicles.</p></details> |  |

Our approach makes two key contributions: (1) HOP, a Hand-Object Planner, which can synthesize diverse hand-object trajectories; and (2) HOT, a Hand-Object Tracker that bridges synthetic-to-physical transfer through reinforcement learning and interaction imitation learning, delivering a generalizable controller conditioned on target hand-object states. Our method extends to diverse object shapes and hand morphologies. Through extensive evaluations, we show that our approach enables dexterous hands to track challenging, long-horizon sequences including object re-arrangement and agile in-hand reorientation. These results represent a significant step toward scalable foundation controllers for manipulation that can learn entirely from synthetic data, breaking the data bottleneck that has long constrained progress in dexterous manipulation.</p></details> |  |

The methodology is thus for joint tracking and intent recognition. Several latent intent models are proposed here within a virtual leader formulation. They capture the influence of the target's hidden goal on its instantaneous behaviour. In this context, various motion models, including for highly maneuvering objects, are also considered. The a priori unknown target intent (e.g. destination) can dynamically change over time and take any value within the state space (e.g. a location or spatial region). A sequential Monte Carlo (particle filtering) approach is introduced for the simultaneous estimation of the target's (kinematic) state and its intent. Rao-Blackwellisation is employed to enhance the statistical performance of the inference routine. Simulated data and real radar measurements are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems (T-AES)</p></details> |

However, these cameras tend to perform poorly under dim lighting and high-speed motion conditions. Event cameras, characterized by low latency, high dynamic range and high temporal resolution, have considerable potential to mitigate these issues. Compared to frame-based vision, there are far fewer studies on event-based vision. To address this research gap, we introduce an initial pilot dataset tailored for event-based ITS, covering vehicle and pedestrian detection and tracking. We establish a tracking-by-detection benchmark with a specialized feature extractor based on this dataset, achieving excellent performance.</p></details> | 10 pages, 9 figures |

However, existing formulations assume an "offline" setting with full video access at query time, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios with power and storage-constrained wearable devices. Towards more application-ready episodic memory systems, we introduce Online Visual Query 2D (OVQ2D), a task where models process video streams online, observing each frame only once, and retrieve object localizations using a compact memory instead of full video history. We address OVQ2D with ESOM (Egocentric Streaming Object Memory), a novel framework integrating an object discovery module, an object tracking module, and a memory module that find, track, and store spatio-temporal object information for efficient querying. Experiments on Ego4D demonstrate ESOM's superiority over other online approaches, though OVQ2D remains challenging, with top performance at only ~4% success. ESOM's accuracy increases markedly with perfect object tracking (31.91%), discovery (40.55%), or both (81.92%), underscoring the need of applied research on these components.</p></details> | <details><summary>in IE...</summary><p>in IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Application of Computer Vision (WACV) 2026</p></details> |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms.

High-fidelity lesion area and target organ segmentation constitutes a key component of the computer-assisted surgery workflow. The low contrast levels and noisy backgrounds of ultrasound videos cause missegmentation of organ boundary, which may lead to small object losses and increase boundary segmentation errors. Object tracking in long videos also remains a significant research challenge. To overcome these challenges, we propose a memory bank-based wavelet filtering and fusion network, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure to effectively extract fine-grained detailed spatial features and integrate high-frequency (HF) information. Specifically, memory-based wavelet convolution is presented to simultaneously capture category, detailed information and utilize adjacent information in the encoder. Cascaded wavelet compression is used to fuse multiscale frequency-domain features and expand the receptive field within each convolutional layer. A long short-term memory bank using cross-attention and memory compression mechanisms is designed to track objects in long video. To fully utilize the boundary-sensitive HF details of feature maps, an HF-aware feature fusion module is designed via adaptive wavelet filters in the decoder. In extensive benchmark tests conducted on four ultrasound video datasets (two thyroid nodule, the thyroid gland, the heart datasets) compared with the state-of-the-art methods, our method demonstrates marked improvements in segmentation metrics. In particular, our method can more accurately segment small thyroid nodules, demonstrating its effectiveness for cases involving small ultrasound objects in long video.

This limitation constrains the interpretability of automated social network analysis in commercial settings. We present a pose-based computational framework for interaction classification that moves beyond proximity heuristics by modeling the spatiotemporal geometry of anatomical keypoints. Rather than relying on pixel-level appearance or simple distance measures, the proposed method encodes interaction-specific motion signatures from keypoint trajectories, enabling differentiation of social interaction valence. The framework is implemented as an end-to-end computer vision pipeline integrating YOLOv11 for object detection (mAP@0.50: 96.24%), supervised individual identification (98.24% accuracy), ByteTrack for multi-object tracking (81.96% accuracy), ZebraPose for 27-point anatomical keypoint estimation, and a support vector machine classifier trained on pose-derived distance dynamics. On annotated interaction clips collected from a commercial dairy barn, the classifier achieved 77.51% accuracy in distinguishing affiliative and agonistic behaviors using pose information alone. Comparative evaluation against a proximity-only baseline shows substantial gains in behavioral discrimination, particularly for affiliative interactions. The results establish a proof-of-concept for automated, vision-based inference of social interactions suitable for constructing interaction-aware social networks, with near-real-time performance on commodity hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 12 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

Current methods for cell tracking are developed on videos with mostly single, constant signals and do not detect pivotal events such as cell death. Here, we present TransientTrack, a deep learning-based framework for cell tracking in multi-channel microscopy video data with transient fluorescent signals that fluctuate over time following processes such as the circadian rhythm of cells. By identifying key cellular events - mitosis (cell division) and apoptosis (cell death) our method allows us to build complete trajectories, including cell lineage information. TransientTrack is lightweight and performs matching on cell detection embeddings directly, without the need for quantification of tracking-specific cell features. Furthermore, our approach integrates Transformer Networks, multi-stage matching using all detection boxes, and the interpolation of missing tracklets with the Kalman Filter. This unified framework achieves strong performance across diverse conditions, effectively tracking cells and capturing cell division and death. We demonstrate the use of TransientTrack in an analysis of the efficacy of a chemotherapeutic drug at a single-cell level. The proposed framework could further advance quantitative studies of cancer cell dynamics, enabling detailed characterization of treatment response and resistance mechanisms.

In this article, we propose a deterministic closed-form elliptical extended object tracker, based on decoupling of the kinematics, orientation, and axis lengths. By disregarding potential correlations between these state components, fewer approximations are required for the individual estimators than for an overall joint solution. The resulting algorithm outperforms existing algorithms, reaching the accuracy of sampling-based procedures. Additionally, a batch-based variant is introduced, yielding highly efficient computation while outperforming all comparable state-of-the-art algorithms. This is validated both by a simulation study using common models from literature, as well as an extensive quantitative evaluation on real automotive radar data.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems</p></details> |

Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods even with limited data and without pretraining.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to VISAPP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Recurrent Video Masked Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13684v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Recurrent Video Masked-Autoencoders (RVM): a novel video representation learning approach that uses a transformer-based recurrent neural network to aggregate dense image features over time, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal structure of natural video data. RVM learns via an asymmetric masked prediction task requiring only a standard pixel reconstruction objective. This design yields a highly efficient ``generalist'' encoder: RVM achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art video models (e.g. VideoMAE, V-JEPA) on video-level tasks like action recognition and point/object tracking, while also performing favorably against image models (e.g. DINOv2) on tasks that test geometric and dense spatial understanding. Notably, RVM achieves strong performance in the small-model regime without requiring knowledge distillation, exhibiting up to 30x greater parameter efficiency than competing video masked autoencoders. Moreover, we demonstrate that RVM's recurrent nature allows for stable feature propagation over long temporal horizons with linear computational cost, overcoming some of the limitations of standard spatio-temporal attention-based architectures. Finally, we use qualitative visualizations to highlight that RVM learns rich representations of scene semantics, structure, and motion.</p></details> |  |
| **[LeafTrackNet: A Deep Learning Framework for Robust Leaf Tracking in Top-Down Plant Phenotyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13130v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High resolution phenotyping at the level of individual leaves offers fine-grained insights into plant development and stress responses. However, the full potential of accurate leaf tracking over time remains largely unexplored due to the absence of robust tracking methods-particularly for structurally complex crops such as canola. Existing plant-specific tracking methods are typically limited to small-scale species or rely on constrained imaging conditions. In contrast, generic multi-object tracking (MOT) methods are not designed for dynamic biological scenes. Progress in the development of accurate leaf tracking models has also been hindered by a lack of large-scale datasets captured under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce CanolaTrack, a new benchmark dataset comprising 5,704 RGB images with 31,840 annotated leaf instances spanning the early growth stages of 184 canola plants. To enable accurate leaf tracking over time, we introduce LeafTrackNet, an efficient framework that combines a YOLOv10-based leaf detector with a MobileNetV3-based embedding network. During inference, leaf identities are maintained over time through an embedding-based memory association strategy. LeafTrackNet outperforms both plant-specific trackers and state-of-the-art MOT baselines, achieving a 9% HOTA improvement on CanolaTrack. With our work we provide a new standard for leaf-level tracking under realistic conditions and we provide CanolaTrack - the largest dataset for leaf tracking in agriculture crops, which will contribute to future research in plant phenotyping. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/shl-shawn/LeafTrackNet.</p></details> |  |
| **[Light Field Based 6DoF Tracking of Previously Unobserved Objects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13007v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.

The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent. Implemented in 40 nm CMOS technology, the 2 mm^2 chip achieves 96 pJ per frame per pixel and 61 pJ per event at 0.8 V, and reaches 98.2 percent recognition accuracy on public UAV datasets across 50 to 400 m ranges and 5 to 80 pixels per second speeds. The results demonstrate state-of-the-art end-to-end energy efficiency for anti-UAV systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>2 pag...</summary><p>2 pages, 7 figures, conference paper published in IEEE Asian Solid-State Circuits Conference 2025</p></details> |

Existing referring video segmentation datasets often focus on salient objects and use language expressions rich in static attributes, potentially allowing the target object to be identified in a single frame. Such datasets underemphasize the role of motion in both videos and languages. To explore the feasibility of using motion expressions and motion reasoning clues for pixel-level video understanding, we introduce MeViS, a dataset containing 33,072 human-annotated motion expressions in both text and audio, covering 8,171 objects in 2,006 videos of complex scenarios. We benchmark 15 existing methods across 4 tasks supported by MeViS, including 6 referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods, 3 audio-guided video object segmentation (AVOS) methods, 2 referring multi-object tracking (RMOT) methods, and 4 video captioning methods for the newly introduced referring motion expression generation (RMEG) task. The results demonstrate weaknesses and limitations of existing methods in addressing motion expression-guided video understanding. We further analyze the challenges and propose an approach LMPM++ for RVOS/AVOS/RMOT that achieves new state-of-the-art results. Our dataset provides a platform that facilitates the development of motion expression-guided video understanding algorithms in complex video scenes. The proposed MeViS dataset and the method's source code are publicly available at https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TPAMI, Project Page: https://henghuiding.com/MeViS/</p></details> |

We propose to benchmark these high performing trackers (SAM2, EfficientTAM, DAM4SAM and SAMURAI) on datasets containing fast moving objects (FMO) specifically designed to be challenging for tracking approaches. The goal is to understand better current limitations in state-of-the-art trackers by providing more detailed insights on the behavior of these trackers. We show that overall the trackers DAM4SAM and SAMURAI perform well on more challenging sequences.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Feature Compression for Machines with Global Statistics Preservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09235v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The split-inference paradigm divides an artificial intelligence (AI) model into two parts. This necessitates the transfer of intermediate feature data between the two halves. Here, effective compression of the feature data becomes vital. In this paper, we employ Z-score normalization to efficiently recover the compressed feature data at the decoder side. To examine the efficacy of our method, the proposed method is integrated into the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) codec standard under development by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). Our method supersedes the existing scaling method used by the current standard under development. It both reduces the overhead bits and improves the end-task accuracy. To further reduce the overhead in certain circumstances, we also propose a simplified method. Experiments show that using our proposed method shows 17.09% reduction in bitrate on average across different tasks and up to 65.69% for object tracking without sacrificing the task accuracy.</p></details> |  |

The primary obstacle to automating this process has been the lack of large-scale, "in-the-wild" video datasets suitable for training robust deep learning models. To address this gap, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark with three novel datasets: Gorilla-SPAC-Wild, the largest video dataset for wild primate re-identification to date; Gorilla-Berlin-Zoo, for assessing cross-domain re-identification generalization; and Gorilla-SPAC-MoT, for evaluating multi-object tracking in camera trap footage. Building on these datasets, we present GorillaWatch, an end-to-end pipeline integrating detection, tracking, and re-identification. To exploit temporal information, we introduce a multi-frame self-supervised pretraining strategy that leverages consistency in tracklets to learn domain-specific features without manual labels. To ensure scientific validity, a differentiable adaptation of AttnLRP verifies that our model relies on discriminative biometric traits rather than background correlations. Extensive benchmarking subsequently demonstrates that aggregating features from large-scale image backbones outperforms specialized video architectures. Finally, we address unsupervised population counting by integrating spatiotemporal constraints into standard clustering to mitigate over-segmentation. We publicly release all code and datasets to facilitate scalable, non-invasive monitoring of endangered species</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WACV 2026</p></details> |

Previous methods, which rely on part-aware optimization, manual assembly, or 2D image generation, often produce unrealistic or incoherent 3D assets due to the challenges of intricate part-level manipulation and limited out-of-domain generation. In contrast, Muses leverages the 3D skeleton, a fundamental representation of biological forms, to explicitly and rationally compose diverse elements. This skeletal foundation formalizes 3D content creation as a structure-aware pipeline of design, composition, and generation. Muses begins by constructing a creatively composed 3D skeleton with coherent layout and scale through graph-constrained reasoning. This skeleton then guides a voxel-based assembly process within a structured latent space, integrating regions from different objects. Finally, image-guided appearance modeling under skeletal conditions is applied to generate a style-consistent and harmonious texture for the assembled shape. Extensive experiments establish Muses' state-of-the-art performance in terms of visual fidelity and alignment with textual descriptions, and potential on flexible 3D object editing.

| **[UniCorn: Towards Self-Improving Unified Multimodal Models through Self-Generated Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03193v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) have achieved remarkable success in cross-modal comprehension, a significant gap persists in their ability to leverage such internal knowledge for high-quality generation. We formalize this discrepancy as Conduction Aphasia, a phenomenon where models accurately interpret multimodal inputs but struggle to translate that understanding into faithful and controllable synthesis. To address this, we propose UniCorn, a simple yet elegant self-improvement framework that eliminates the need for external data or teacher supervision. By partitioning a single UMM into three collaborative roles: Proposer, Solver, and Judge, UniCorn generates high-quality interactions via self-play and employs cognitive pattern reconstruction to distill latent understanding into explicit generative signals. To validate the restoration of multimodal coherence, we introduce UniCycle, a cycle-consistency benchmark based on a Text to Image to Text reconstruction loop. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniCorn achieves comprehensive and substantial improvements over the base model across six general image generation benchmarks. Notably, it achieves SOTA performance on TIIF(73.8), DPG(86.8), CompBench(88.5), and UniCycle while further delivering substantial gains of +5.0 on WISE and +6.5 on OneIG. These results highlight that our method significantly enhances T2I generation while maintaining robust comprehension, demonstrating the scalability of fully self-supervised refinement for unified multimodal intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Thinker: A General Reasoning Modular Core for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03127v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite impressive progress in high-fidelity image synthesis, generative models still struggle with logic-intensive instruction following, exposing a persistent reasoning--execution gap. Meanwhile, closed-source systems (e.g., Nano Banana) have demonstrated strong reasoning-driven image generation, highlighting a substantial gap to current open-source models. We argue that closing this gap requires not merely better visual generators, but executable reasoning: decomposing high-level intents into grounded, verifiable plans that directly steer the generative process. To this end, we propose Unified Thinker, a task-agnostic reasoning architecture for general image generation, designed as a unified planning core that can plug into diverse generators and workflows. Unified Thinker decouples a dedicated Thinker from the image Generator, enabling modular upgrades of reasoning without retraining the entire generative model. We further introduce a two-stage training paradigm: we first build a structured planning interface for the Thinker, then apply reinforcement learning to ground its policy in pixel-level feedback, encouraging plans that optimize visual correctness over textual plausibility. Extensive experiments on text-to-image generation and image editing show that Unified Thinker substantially improves image reasoning and generation quality.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we propose LAMS-Edit, leveraging intermediate states from the inversion process--an essential step in real-image editing--during edited image generation. Specifically, latent representations and attention maps from both processes are combined at each step using weighted interpolation, controlled by a scheduler. This technique, Latent and Attention Mixing with Schedulers (LAMS), integrates with Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) to form LAMS-Edit--an extensible framework that supports precise editing with region masks and enables style transfer via LoRA. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LAMS-Edit effectively balances content preservation and edit application.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VTON models often suffer from artifacts such as garment distortion and body inconsistency, highlighting the need for reliable quality evaluation of VTON-generated images. To this end, we construct VTONQA, the first multi-dimensional quality assessment dataset specifically designed for VTON, which contains 8,132 images generated by 11 representative VTON models, along with 24,396 mean opinion scores (MOSs) across three evaluation dimensions (i.e., clothing fit, body compatibility, and overall quality). Based on VTONQA, we benchmark both VTON models and a diverse set of image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, revealing the limitations of existing methods and highlighting the value of the proposed dataset. We believe that the VTONQA dataset and corresponding benchmarks will provide a solid foundation for perceptually aligned evaluation, benefiting both the development of quality assessment methods and the advancement of VTON models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Go with Your Gut: Scaling Confidence for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26376v2)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling (TTS) has demonstrated remarkable success in enhancing large language models, yet its application to next-token prediction (NTP) autoregressive (AR) image generation remains largely uncharted. Existing TTS approaches for visual AR (VAR), which rely on frequent partial decoding and external reward models, are ill-suited for NTP-based image generation due to the inherent incompleteness of intermediate decoding results. To bridge this gap, we introduce ScalingAR, the first TTS framework specifically designed for NTP-based AR image generation that eliminates the need for early decoding or auxiliary rewards. ScalingAR leverages token entropy as a novel signal in visual token generation and operates at two complementary scaling levels: (i) Profile Level, which streams a calibrated confidence state by fusing intrinsic and conditional signals; and (ii) Policy Level, which utilizes this state to adaptively terminate low-confidence trajectories and dynamically schedule guidance for phase-appropriate conditioning strength. Experiments on both general and compositional benchmarks show that ScalingAR (1) improves base models by 12.5% on GenEval and 15.2% on TIIF-Bench, (2) efficiently reduces visual token consumption by 62.0% while outperforming baselines, and (3) successfully enhances robustness, mitigating performance drops by 26.0% in challenging scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/EnVision-Research/ScalingAR</p></details> |
| **[GRRE: Leveraging G-Channel Removed Reconstruction Error for Robust Detection of AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02709v1)** | 2026-01-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models, particularly diffusion models and GANs, has greatly increased the difficulty of distinguishing synthetic images from real ones. Although numerous detection methods have been proposed, their accuracy often degrades when applied to images generated by novel or unseen generative models, highlighting the challenge of achieving strong generalization. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel detection paradigm based on channel removal reconstruction. Specifically, we observe that when the green (G) channel is removed from real images and reconstructed, the resulting reconstruction errors differ significantly from those of AI-generated images. Building upon this insight, we propose G-channel Removed Reconstruction Error (GRRE), a simple yet effective method that exploits this discrepancy for robust AI-generated image detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRRE consistently achieves high detection accuracy across multiple generative models, including those unseen during training. Compared with existing approaches, GRRE not only maintains strong robustness against various perturbations and post-processing operations but also exhibits superior cross-model generalization. These results highlight the potential of channel-removal-based reconstruction as a powerful forensic tool for safeguarding image authenticity in the era of generative AI.</p></details> |  |

Among these advancements, CLIP stands out as a remarkable achievement which is a sophisticated autoencoder adept at encoding both textual and visual information within a unified latent space. This paper delves into a comparative analysis between CLIP and its recent counterpart, CLOOB. To unravel the intricate distinctions within the embedding spaces crafted by these models, we employ topological data analysis. Our approach encompasses a comprehensive examination of the modality gap drivers, the clustering structures existing across both high and low dimensions, and the pivotal role that dimension collapse plays in shaping their respective embedding spaces. Empirical experiments substantiate the implications of our analyses on downstream performance across various contextual scenarios. Through this investigation, we aim to shed light on the nuanced intricacies that underlie the comparative efficacy of CLIP and CLOOB, offering insights into their respective strengths and weaknesses, and providing a foundation for further refinement and advancement in multimodal model research.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript contains substantive technical inaccuracies and an incomplete treatment of the stated topic.

| **[Compositional Discrete Latent Code for High Fidelity, Productive Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12318v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We argue that diffusion models' success in modeling complex distributions is, for the most part, coming from their input conditioning. This paper investigates the representation used to condition diffusion models from the perspective that ideal representations should improve sample fidelity, be easy to generate, and be compositional to allow out-of-training samples generation. We introduce Discrete Latent Code (DLC), an image representation derived from Simplicial Embeddings trained with a self-supervised learning objective. DLCs are sequences of discrete tokens, as opposed to the standard continuous image embeddings. They are easy to generate and their compositionality enables sampling of novel images beyond the training distribution. Diffusion models trained with DLCs have improved generation fidelity, establishing a new state-of-the-art for unconditional image generation on ImageNet. Additionally, we show that composing DLCs allows the image generator to produce out-of-distribution samples that coherently combine the semantics of images in diverse ways. Finally, we showcase how DLCs can enable text-to-image generation by leveraging large-scale pretrained language models. We efficiently finetune a text diffusion language model to generate DLCs that produce novel samples outside of the image generator training distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS, 22 pages, 7 tables, 12 figures, code and models available</p></details> |
| **[HADIS: Hybrid Adaptive Diffusion Model Serving for Efficient Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00642v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved remarkable visual quality but incur high computational costs, making latency-aware, scalable deployment challenging. To address this, we advocate a hybrid architecture that achieves query awareness when serving diffusion models. Unlike existing query-aware serving systems that cascade lightweight and heavyweight models with a fixed configuration, our hybrid architecture first routes each query directly to a suitable model variant, then reroutes it to a cascaded heavyweight model only if necessary. We theoretically analyze conditions for the hybrid architecture to outperform non-hybrid alternatives in latency and response quality. Building on this architecture, we design HADIS, a hybrid serving system for latency-aware diffusion models that jointly optimizes cascade model selection, query routing, and resource allocation. To reduce the complexity of resource management, HADIS uses an offline profiling phase to produce a Pareto-optimal cascade configuration table. At runtime, HADIS selects the best cascade configuration and GPU allocation given latency and workload constraints. Empirical evaluations on real-world traces demonstrate that HADIS improves response quality by up to 35% while reducing latency violation rates by 2.7-45$\times$ compared to state-of-the-art model serving systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 12 figures |
| **[VIBE: Visual Instruction Based Editor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02242v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-based image editing is among the fastest developing areas in generative AI. Over the past year, the field has reached a new level, with dozens of open-source models released alongside highly capable commercial systems. However, only a limited number of open-source approaches currently achieve real-world quality. In addition, diffusion backbones, the dominant choice for these pipelines, are often large and computationally expensive for many deployments and research settings, with widely used variants typically containing 6B to 20B parameters. This paper presents a compact, high-throughput instruction-based image editing pipeline that uses a modern 2B-parameter Qwen3-VL model to guide the editing process and the 1.6B-parameter diffusion model Sana1.5 for image generation. Our design decisions across architecture, data processing, training configuration, and evaluation target low-cost inference and strict source consistency while maintaining high quality across the major edit categories feasible at this scale. Evaluated on the ImgEdit and GEdit benchmarks, the proposed method matches or exceeds the performance of substantially heavier baselines, including models with several times as many parameters and higher inference cost, and is particularly strong on edits that require preserving the input image, such as an attribute adjustment, object removal, background edits, and targeted replacement. The model fits within 24 GB of GPU memory and generates edited images at up to 2K resolution in approximately 4 seconds on an NVIDIA H100 in BF16, without additional inference optimizations or distillation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unraveling MMDiT Blocks: Training-free Analysis and Enhancement of Text-conditioned Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02211v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs of transformer-based diffusion models, particularly with Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) driven models like FLUX and Qwen Image, have facilitated thrilling experiences in text-to-image generation and editing. To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality. These results advance understanding of MMDiT models and provide valuable insights to unlock new possibilities for further improvements.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Agentic Retoucher for Text-To-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02046v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models such as SDXL and FLUX have achieved impressive photorealism, yet small-scale distortions remain pervasive in limbs, face, text and so on. Existing refinement approaches either perform costly iterative re-generation or rely on vision-language models (VLMs) with weak spatial grounding, leading to semantic drift and unreliable local edits. To close this gap, we propose Agentic Retoucher, a hierarchical decision-driven framework that reformulates post-generation correction as a human-like perception-reasoning-action loop. Specifically, we design (1) a perception agent that learns contextual saliency for fine-grained distortion localization under text-image consistency cues, (2) a reasoning agent that performs human-aligned inferential diagnosis via progressive preference alignment, and (3) an action agent that adaptively plans localized inpainting guided by user preference. This design integrates perceptual evidence, linguistic reasoning, and controllable correction into a unified, self-corrective decision process. To enable fine-grained supervision and quantitative evaluation, we further construct GenBlemish-27K, a dataset of 6K T2I images with 27K annotated artifact regions across 12 categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Agentic Retoucher consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in perceptual quality, distortion localization and human preference alignment, establishing a new paradigm for self-corrective and perceptually reliable T2I generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlignVTOFF: Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment for High-Fidelity Virtual Try-Off](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02038v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtual Try-Off (VTOFF) is a challenging multimodal image generation task that aims to synthesize high-fidelity flat-lay garments under complex geometric deformation and rich high-frequency textures. Existing methods often rely on lightweight modules for fast feature extraction, which struggles to preserve structured patterns and fine-grained details, leading to texture attenuation during generation.To address these issues, we propose AlignVTOFF, a novel parallel U-Net framework built upon a Reference U-Net and Texture-Spatial Feature Alignment (TSFA). The Reference U-Net performs multi-scale feature extraction and enhances geometric fidelity, enabling robust modeling of deformation while retaining complex structured patterns. TSFA then injects the reference garment features into a frozen denoising U-Net via a hybrid attention design, consisting of a trainable cross-attention module and a frozen self-attention module. This design explicitly aligns texture and spatial cues and alleviates the loss of high-frequency information during the denoising process.Extensive experiments across multiple settings demonstrate that AlignVTOFF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing flat-lay garment results with improved structural realism and high-frequency detail fidelity.</p></details> |  |
| **[CountCluster: Training-Free Object Quantity Guidance with Cross-Attention Map Clustering for Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10710v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models have demonstrated strong performance in terms of image quality and diversity. However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

| **[Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09040v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result, current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR), which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is available at https://github.com/AlenjandroWang/ASVR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Semantic Communication With Homomorphic Encryption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10182v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Semantic Communication (SemCom), which aims to achieve efficient and reliable transmission of meaning between agents, has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. To ensure the security of communication systems, encryption techniques are employed to safeguard confidentiality and integrity. However, existing encryption schemes encounter obstacles when applied to SemCom. To address this issue, this paper explores the feasibility of applying homomorphic encryption (HE) to SemCom. Initially, we review the encryption algorithms utilized in mobile communication systems and analyze the challenges associated with their application to SemCom. Subsequently, we overview HE techniques and employ scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) to demonstrate that the extractable semantic information can be preserved in homomorphic encrypted ciphertext. Based on this finding, we further propose the HE-joint source-channel coding (HE-JSCC) scheme, where the traditional JSCC model architecture is modified to support HE operations. Moreover, we present the simulation results for image classification and image generation tasks. Furthermore, we provide potential future research directions for homomorphic encrypted SemCom.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Improving Flexible Image Tokenizers for Autoregressive Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01535v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flexible image tokenizers aim to represent an image using an ordered 1D variable-length token sequence. This flexible tokenization is typically achieved through nested dropout, where a portion of trailing tokens is randomly truncated during training, and the image is reconstructed using the remaining preceding sequence. However, this tail-truncation strategy inherently concentrates the image information in the early tokens, limiting the effectiveness of downstream AutoRegressive (AR) image generation as the token length increases. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{ReToK}, a flexible tokenizer with \underline{Re}dundant \underline{Tok}en Padding and Hierarchical Semantic Regularization, designed to fully exploit all tokens for enhanced latent modeling. Specifically, we introduce \textbf{Redundant Token Padding} to activate tail tokens more frequently, thereby alleviating information over-concentration in the early tokens. In addition, we apply \textbf{Hierarchical Semantic Regularization} to align the decoding features of earlier tokens with those from a pre-trained vision foundation model, while progressively reducing the regularization strength toward the tail to allow finer low-level detail reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ReTok: on ImageNet 256$\times$256, our method achieves superior generation performance compared with both flexible and fixed-length tokenizers. Code will be available at: \href{https://github.com/zfu006/ReTok}{https://github.com/zfu006/ReTok}</p></details> |  |
| **[Domain Adaptation of Carotid Ultrasound Images using Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01460v1)** | 2026-01-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has been extensively used in medical imaging applications, assuming that the test and training datasets belong to the same probability distribution. However, a common challenge arises when working with medical images generated by different systems or even the same system with different parameter settings. Such images contain diverse textures and reverberation noise that violate the aforementioned assumption. Consequently, models trained on data from one device or setting often struggle to perform effectively with data from other devices or settings. In addition, retraining models for each specific device or setting is labor-intensive and costly. To address these issues in ultrasound images, we propose a novel Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model. We formulated the domain adaptation tasks as an image-to-image translation task, in which we modified the texture patterns and removed reverberation noise in the test data images from the source domain to align with those in the target domain images while keeping the image content unchanged. We applied the proposed method to two datasets containing carotid ultrasound images from three different domains. The experimental results demonstrate that the model successfully translated the texture pattern of images and removed reverberation noise from the ultrasound images. Furthermore, we evaluated the CycleGAN approaches for a comparative study with the proposed model. The experimental findings conclusively demonstrated that the proposed model achieved domain adaptation (histogram correlation (0.960 (0.019), & 0.920 (0.043) and bhattacharya distance (0.040 (0.020), & 0.085 (0.048)), compared to no adaptation (0.916 (0.062) & 0.890 (0.077), 0.090 (0.070) & 0.121 (0.095)) for both datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

This work presents a hybrid CMOS-spintronic deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) architecture for synthetic image generation. The proposed generative vision model approach follows the standard framework, leveraging generator and discriminators adversarial training with our designed spintronics hardware for deconvolution, convolution, and activation layers of the DCGAN architecture. To enable hardware aware spintronic implementation, the generator's deconvolution layers are restructured as zero padded convolution, allowing seamless integration with a 6-bit skyrmion based synapse in a crossbar, without compromising training performance. Nonlinear activation functions are implemented using a hybrid CMOS domain wall based Rectified linear unit (ReLU) and Leaky ReLU units. Our proposed tunable Leaky ReLU employs domain wall position coded, continuous resistance states and a piecewise uniaxial parabolic anisotropy profile with a parallel MTJ readout, exhibiting energy consumption of 0.192 pJ. Our spintronic DCGAN model demonstrates adaptability across both grayscale and colored datasets, achieving Fr'echet Inception Distances (FID) of 27.5 for the Fashion MNIST and 45.4 for Anime Face datasets, with testing energy (training energy) of 4.9 nJ (14.97~nJ/image) and 24.72 nJ (74.7 nJ/image).</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Improved Object-Centric Diffusion Learning with Registers and Contrastive Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01224v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Slot Attention (SA) with pretrained diffusion models has recently shown promise for object-centric learning (OCL), but suffers from slot entanglement and weak alignment between object slots and image content. We propose Contrastive Object-centric Diffusion Alignment (CODA), a simple extension that (i) employs register slots to absorb residual attention and reduce interference between object slots, and (ii) applies a contrastive alignment loss to explicitly encourage slot-image correspondence. The resulting training objective serves as a tractable surrogate for maximizing mutual information (MI) between slots and inputs, strengthening slot representation quality. On both synthetic (MOVi-C/E) and real-world datasets (VOC, COCO), CODA improves object discovery (e.g., +6.1% FG-ARI on COCO), property prediction, and compositional image generation over strong baselines. Register slots add negligible overhead, keeping CODA efficient and scalable. These results indicate potential applications of CODA as an effective framework for robust OCL in complex, real-world scenes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Networks on Symmetric Spaces of Noncompact Type](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01097v1)** | 2026-01-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent works have demonstrated promising performances of neural networks on hyperbolic spaces and symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds. These spaces belong to a family of Riemannian manifolds referred to as symmetric spaces of noncompact type. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for developing neural networks on such spaces. Our approach relies on a unified formulation of the distance from a point to a hyperplane on the considered spaces. We show that some existing formulations of the point-to-hyperplane distance can be recovered by our approach under specific settings. Furthermore, we derive a closed-form expression for the point-to-hyperplane distance in higher-rank symmetric spaces of noncompact type equipped with G-invariant Riemannian metrics. The derived distance then serves as a tool to design fully-connected (FC) layers and an attention mechanism for neural networks on the considered spaces. Our approach is validated on challenging benchmarks for image classification, electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification, image generation, and natural language inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contractive Diffusion Policies: Robust Action Diffusion via Contractive Score-Based Sampling with Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01003v1)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion policies have emerged as powerful generative models for offline policy learning, whose sampling process can be rigorously characterized by a score function guiding a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). However, the same score-based SDE modeling that grants diffusion policies the flexibility to learn diverse behavior also incurs solver and score-matching errors, large data requirements, and inconsistencies in action generation. While less critical in image generation, these inaccuracies compound and lead to failure in continuous control settings. We introduce Contractive Diffusion Policies (CDPs) to induce contractive behavior in the diffusion sampling dynamics. Contraction pulls nearby flows closer to enhance robustness against solver and score-matching errors while reducing unwanted action variance. We develop an in-depth theoretical analysis along with a practical implementation recipe to incorporate CDPs into existing diffusion policy architectures with minimal modification and computational cost. We evaluate CDPs for offline learning by conducting extensive experiments in simulation and real-world settings. Across benchmarks, CDPs often outperform baseline policies, with pronounced benefits under data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, existing methods struggle with a critical trade-off between fidelity and efficiency. Tuning-based approaches rely on time-consuming and resource-intensive, subject-specific optimization, while zero-shot methods often fail to maintain adequate subject consistency. In this work, we propose FreeGraftor, a training-free framework that addresses these limitations through cross-image feature grafting. Specifically, FreeGraftor leverages semantic matching and position-constrained attention fusion to transfer visual details from reference subjects to the generated images. Additionally, our framework introduces a novel noise initialization strategy to preserve the geometry priors of reference subjects, facilitating robust feature matching. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method enables precise subject identity transfer while maintaining text-aligned scene synthesis. Without requiring model fine-tuning or additional training, FreeGraftor significantly outperforms existing zero-shot and training-free approaches in both subject fidelity and text alignment. Furthermore, our framework can seamlessly extend to multi-subject generation, making it practical for real-world deployment.

| **[Unknown Aware AI-Generated Content Attribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00218v1)** | 2026-01-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of photorealistic generative models has made it increasingly important to attribute the origin of synthetic content, moving beyond binary real or fake detection toward identifying the specific model that produced a given image. We study the problem of distinguishing outputs from a target generative model (e.g., OpenAI Dalle 3) from other sources, including real images and images generated by a wide range of alternative models. Using CLIP features and a simple linear classifier, shown to be effective in prior work, we establish a strong baseline for target generator attribution using only limited labeled data from the target model and a small number of known generators. However, this baseline struggles to generalize to harder, unseen, and newly released generators. To address this limitation, we propose a constrained optimization approach that leverages unlabeled wild data, consisting of images collected from the Internet that may include real images, outputs from unknown generators, or even samples from the target model itself. The proposed method encourages wild samples to be classified as non target while explicitly constraining performance on labeled data to remain high. Experimental results show that incorporating wild data substantially improves attribution performance on challenging unseen generators, demonstrating that unlabeled data from the wild can be effectively exploited to enhance AI generated content attribution in open world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[GameTileNet: A Semantic Dataset for Low-Resolution Game Art in Procedural Content Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02941v2)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GameTileNet is a dataset designed to provide semantic labels for low-resolution digital game art, advancing procedural content generation (PCG) and related AI research as a vision-language alignment task. Large Language Models (LLMs) and image-generative AI models have enabled indie developers to create visual assets, such as sprites, for game interactions. However, generating visuals that align with game narratives remains challenging due to inconsistent AI outputs, requiring manual adjustments by human artists. The diversity of visual representations in automatically generated game content is also limited because of the imbalance in distributions across styles for training data. GameTileNet addresses this by collecting artist-created game tiles from OpenGameArt.org under Creative Commons licenses and providing semantic annotations to support narrative-driven content generation. The dataset introduces a pipeline for object detection in low-resolution tile-based game art (e.g., 32x32 pixels) and annotates semantics, connectivity, and object classifications. GameTileNet is a valuable resource for improving PCG methods, supporting narrative-rich game content, and establishing a baseline for object detection in low-resolution, non-photorealistic images. TL;DR: GameTileNet is a semantic dataset of low-resolution game tiles designed to support narrative-driven procedural content generation through visual-language alignment.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version of a paper accepted for oral presentation at AIIDE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are First-Order Diffusion Samplers Really Slower? A Fast Forward-Value Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24927v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order ODE solvers have become a standard tool for accelerating diffusion probabilistic model (DPM) sampling, motivating the widespread view that first-order methods are inherently slower and that increasing discretization order is the primary path to faster generation. This paper challenges this belief and revisits acceleration from a complementary angle: beyond solver order, the placement of DPM evaluations along the reverse-time dynamics can substantially affect sampling accuracy in the low-neural function evaluation (NFE) regime. We propose a novel training-free, first-order sampler whose leading discretization error has the opposite sign to that of DDIM. Algorithmically, the method approximates the forward-value evaluation via a cheap one-step lookahead predictor. We provide theoretical guarantees showing that the resulting sampler provably approximates the ideal forward-value trajectory while retaining first-order convergence. Empirically, across standard image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, ImageNet, FFHQ, and LSUN), the proposed sampler consistently improves sample quality under the same NFE budget and can be competitive with, and sometimes outperform, state-of-the-art higher-order samplers. Overall, the results suggest that the placement of DPM evaluations provides an additional and largely independent design angle for accelerating diffusion sampling.</p></details> |  |

We introduce CritiFusion, a novel inference-time framework that integrates a multimodal semantic critique mechanism with frequency-domain refinement to improve text-to-image consistency and detail. The proposed CritiCore module leverages a vision-language model and multiple large language models to enrich the prompt context and produce high-level semantic feedback, guiding the diffusion process to better align generated content with the prompt's intent. Additionally, SpecFusion merges intermediate generation states in the spectral domain, injecting coarse structural information while preserving high-frequency details. No additional model training is required. CritiFusion serves as a plug-in refinement stage compatible with existing diffusion backbones. Experiments on standard benchmarks show that our method notably improves human-aligned metrics of text-to-image correspondence and visual quality. CritiFusion consistently boosts performance on human preference scores and aesthetic evaluations, achieving results on par with state-of-the-art reward optimization approaches. Qualitative results further demonstrate superior detail, realism, and prompt fidelity, indicating the effectiveness of our semantic critique and spectral alignment strategy.</p></details> |  |

With the growing prevalence of deepfake technology, which can manipulate facial features in images and videos, the potential for fraud in online transactions has escalated. Traditional security systems struggle to identify these sophisticated forms of fraud. This research proposes a novel GAN-based model that enhances online payment security by identifying subtle manipulations in payment images. The model is trained on a dataset consisting of real-world online payment images and deepfake images generated using advanced GAN architectures, such as StyleGAN and DeepFake. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can accurately distinguish between legitimate transactions and deepfakes, achieving a high detection rate above 95%. This approach significantly improves the robustness of payment systems against AI-driven fraud. The paper contributes to the growing field of digital security, offering insights into the application of GANs for fraud detection in financial services.
