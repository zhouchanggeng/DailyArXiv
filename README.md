| **[MAGIC-Enhanced Keyword Prompting for Zero-Shot Audio Captioning with CLIP Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12591v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Audio Captioning (AAC) generates captions for audio clips but faces challenges due to limited datasets compared to image captioning. To overcome this, we propose the zero-shot AAC system that leverages pre-trained models, eliminating the need for extensive training. Our approach uses a pre-trained audio CLIP model to extract auditory features and generate a structured prompt, which guides a Large Language Model (LLM) in caption generation. Unlike traditional greedy decoding, our method refines token selection through the audio CLIP model, ensuring alignment with the audio content. Experimental results demonstrate a 35% improvement in NLG mean score (from 4.7 to 7.3) using MAGIC search with the WavCaps model. The performance is heavily influenced by the audio-text matching model and keyword selection, with optimal results achieved using a single keyword prompt, and a 50% performance drop when no keyword list is used.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The 26th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE), scheduled for 15-17 December 2025 in Marrakech, Morocco</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Domain Attribute Alignment with CLIP: A Rehearsal-Free Approach for Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11264v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Class-Incremental Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (CI-UDA) aims to adapt a model from a labeled source domain to an unlabeled target domain, where the sets of potential target classes appearing at different time steps are disjoint and are subsets of the source classes. The key to solving this problem lies in avoiding catastrophic forgetting of knowledge about previous target classes during continuously mitigating the domain shift. Most previous works cumbersomely combine two technical components. On one hand, they need to store and utilize rehearsal target sample from previous time steps to avoid catastrophic forgetting; on the other hand, they perform alignment only between classes shared across domains at each time step. Consequently, the memory will continuously increase and the asymmetric alignment may inevitably result in knowledge forgetting. In this paper, we propose to mine and preserve domain-invariant and class-agnostic knowledge to facilitate the CI-UDA task. Specifically, via using CLIP, we extract the class-agnostic properties which we name as "attribute". In our framework, we learn a "key-value" pair to represent an attribute, where the key corresponds to the visual prototype and the value is the textual prompt. We maintain two attribute dictionaries, each corresponding to a different domain. Then we perform attribute alignment across domains to mitigate the domain shift, via encouraging visual attention consistency and prediction consistency. Through attribute modeling and cross-domain alignment, we effectively reduce catastrophic knowledge forgetting while mitigating the domain shift, in a rehearsal-free way. Experiments on three CI-UDA benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and effectively alleviates catastrophic forgetting.

| **[When and How Does CLIP Enable Domain and Compositional Generalization?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09507v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable generalization performance of contrastive vision-language models like CLIP is often attributed to the diversity of their training distributions. However, key questions remain unanswered: Can CLIP generalize to an entirely unseen domain when trained on a diverse mixture of domains (domain generalization)? Can it generalize to unseen classes within partially seen domains (compositional generalization)? What factors affect such generalization? To answer these questions, we trained CLIP models on systematically constructed training distributions with controlled domain diversity and object class exposure. Our experiments show that domain diversity is essential for both domain and compositional generalization, yet compositional generalization can be surprisingly weaker than domain generalization when the training distribution contains a suboptimal subset of the test domain. Through data-centric and mechanistic analyses, we find that successful generalization requires the learning of sufficiently shared representations in intermediate layers and circuits.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 (Spotlight)</p></details> |
| **[SPECS: Specificity-Enhanced CLIP-Score for Long Image Caption Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03897v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As interest grows in generating long, detailed image captions, standard evaluation metrics become increasingly unreliable. N-gram-based metrics though efficient, fail to capture semantic correctness. Representational Similarity (RS) metrics, designed to address this, initially saw limited use due to high computational costs, while today, despite advances in hardware, they remain unpopular due to low correlation to human judgments. Meanwhile, metrics based on large language models (LLMs) show strong correlation with human judgments, but remain too expensive for iterative use during model development. We introduce SPECS (Specificity-Enhanced CLIPScore), a reference-free RS metric tailored to long image captioning. SPECS modifies CLIP with a new objective that emphasizes specificity: rewarding correct details and penalizing incorrect ones. We show that SPECS matches the performance of open-source LLM-based metrics in correlation to human judgments, while being far more efficient. This makes it a practical alternative for iterative checkpoint evaluation during image captioning model development.Our code can be found at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/SPECS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping directly in the importance-sampling (IS) weight space. We revisit sequence-level RL methods and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the effective objective. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a directional cosine guarantee between the clipped and true updates. FSPO introduces a simple, Gaussian-motivated remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that applies a KL-corrected drift term and scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms all baselines across multiple evaluation datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.</p></details> | BIBM |
| **[DCPO: Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02333v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a promising framework for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing approaches such as GRPO often suffer from zero gradients. This problem arises primarily due to fixed clipping bounds for token-level probability ratios and the standardization of identical rewards, which can lead to ineffective gradient updates and underutilization of generated responses. In this work, we propose Dynamic Clipping Policy Optimization(DCPO), which introduces a dynamic clipping strategy that adaptively adjusts clipping bounds based on token-specific prior probabilities to enhance token-level exploration, and a smooth advantage standardization technique that standardizes rewards across cumulative training steps to improve the response-level effective utilization of generated responses. DCPO achieved state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks based on four different models. In particular, DCPO achieved an Avg@1 of 46.7 under greedy decoding and an Avg@32 of 38.8 under 32 times sampling on the AIME24 benchmark, surpassing DAPO (36.7/31.6), GRPO (36.7/32.1) and GSPO (40.0/34.9) on the Qwen2.5-Math-7B model. On the AIME25 benchmark based on Qwen2.5-14B, DCPO achieves a performance of (23.3/19.0), surpassing GRPO (13.3/10.5), DAPO (20.0/15.3) and GSPO (16.7/9.9). Furthermore, DCPO achieved an average 28% improvement in the nonzero advantage over GRPO in four models, doubled the training efficiency over DAPO, and significantly reduced the token clipping ratio by an order of magnitude compared to both GRPO and DAPO, while achieving superior performance. These results highlight DCPO's effectiveness in leveraging generated data more efficiently for reinforcement learning in large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AttriPrompt: Dynamic Prompt Composition Learning for CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05949v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment, neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations, we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment. Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[VLSM-Ensemble: Ensembling CLIP-based Vision-Language Models for Enhanced Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05154v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models and their adaptations to image segmentation tasks present enormous potential for producing highly accurate and interpretable results. However, implementations based on CLIP and BiomedCLIP are still lagging behind more sophisticated architectures such as CRIS. In this work, instead of focusing on text prompt engineering as is the norm, we attempt to narrow this gap by showing how to ensemble vision-language segmentation models (VLSMs) with a low-complexity CNN. By doing so, we achieve a significant Dice score improvement of 6.3% on the BKAI polyp dataset using the ensembled BiomedCLIPSeg, while other datasets exhibit gains ranging from 1% to 6%. Furthermore, we provide initial results on additional four radiology and non-radiology datasets. We conclude that ensembling works differently across these datasets (from outperforming to underperforming the CRIS model), indicating a topic for future investigation by the community. The code is available at https://github.com/juliadietlmeier/VLSM-Ensemble.</p></details> | <details><summary>Medic...</summary><p>Medical Imaging with Deep Learning (MIDL 2025) short paper</p></details> |
| **[TriCLIP-3D: A Unified Parameter-Efficient Framework for Tri-Modal 3D Visual Grounding based on CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14904v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information in real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for embodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on separate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D point clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to train. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP for 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D encoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for feature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training inefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal network to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds), significantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal model with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the tri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across modalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module is designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and images. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and introduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding. Together, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the three modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to the baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by approximately 58\%, while achieving a 6.52\% improvement in the 3D detection task and a 6.25\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChordPrompt: Orchestrating Cross-Modal Prompt Synergy for Multi-Domain Incremental Learning in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19608v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) empowers pre-trained vision-language models to adapt effectively to novel or previously underrepresented data distributions without comprehensive retraining, enhancing their adaptability and efficiency. While vision-language models like CLIP show great promise, they struggle to maintain performance across domains in incremental learning scenarios. Existing prompt learning methods face two main limitations: 1) they primarily focus on class-incremental learning scenarios, lacking specific strategies for multi-domain task incremental learning; 2) most current approaches employ single-modal prompts, neglecting the potential benefits of cross-modal information exchange. To address these challenges, we propose the \ChordPrompt framework, which facilitates a harmonious interplay between visual and textual prompts. \ChordPrompt introduces cross-modal prompts to leverage interactions between visual and textual information. Our approach also employs domain-adaptive text prompts to select appropriate prompts for continual adaptation across multiple domains. Comprehensive experiments on multi-domain incremental learning benchmarks demonstrate that \ChordPrompt outperforms state-of-the-art methods in zero-shot generalization and downstream task performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the European Conference on Machine Learning and Principles and Practice of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (ECML-PKDD 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Hues and Cues: Human vs. CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02305v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Playing games is inherently human, and a lot of games are created to challenge different human characteristics. However, these tasks are often left out when evaluating the human-like nature of artificial models. The objective of this work is proposing a new approach to evaluate artificial models via board games. To this effect, we test the color perception and color naming capabilities of CLIP by playing the board game Hues & Cues and assess its alignment with humans. Our experiments show that CLIP is generally well aligned with human observers, but our approach brings to light certain cultural biases and inconsistencies when dealing with different abstraction levels that are hard to identify with other testing strategies. Our findings indicate that assessing models with different tasks like board games can make certain deficiencies in the models stand out in ways that are difficult to test with the commonly used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures. 8th annual conference on Cognitive Computational Neuroscience</p></details> |
| **[Occlusion Robustness of CLIP for Military Vehicle Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20760v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around 35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for real-world deployment of CLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at SPIE: Sensors + Imaging, Artificial Intelligence for Security and Defence Applications II</p></details> |
| **[Rotate, Clip, and Partition: Towards W2A4KV4 Quantization by Integrating Rotation and Learnable Non-uniform Quantizer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15779v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Rotate, Clip, and Partition (RCP), a quantization-aware training (QAT) approach that first realizes extreme compression of LLMs with W2A4KV4(2-bit weight, 4-bit activation, and 4-bit KV cache) configuration. RCP integrates recent rotation techniques with a novel non-uniform weight quantizer design, by quantitatively analyzing the impact of random rotation on 2-bit weight quantization. Our weight quantizer features Learnable Direct Partitioning (LDP), which introduces learnable parameters to directly learn non-uniform intervals jointly with LLM weights. We also present a specialized GPU kernel that supports GEMV on non-uniform W2A4. Experiments show that RCP can compress LLaMA-2-7B to W2A4KV4 with a loss of only 2.84 WikiText2 ppl and 5.29 times reduced memory footprint. Furthermore, RCP can quantize challenging mobile-targeted LLaMA-3.2 models and domain-specific WizardCoder-7B and MetaMath-7B with no critical problems such as convergence failure and repetition.

| **[Language-Aware Information Maximization for Transductive Few-Shot CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00305v1)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transductive few-shot learning has triggered an abundant literature focusing on vision-only models, but is still at a nascent stage within the recent context of foundational vision-language models (VLMs). Only a few recent methods addressed the problem, pointing to the potential of tranduction in VLMs and to the need for VLM-tailored methods. Building on this momentum, we leverage information-theoretic concepts and recent progress in parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), developing a highly competitive transductive few-shot CLIP method. Specifically, we introduce a novel Language-aware Information MaximizatiOn (LIMO) loss integrating three complementary terms: (i) the mutual information between the vision inputs and the textual class descriptions; (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence penalizing deviation of the network's probabilistic outputs from the text-driven zero-shot predictions; and (iii) a standard cross-entropy loss based on the labeled shots. Furthermore, we challenge the commonly followed fine-tuning practices in the context of transductive few-shot learning, and explore PEFT strategies, completely overlooked in this context. Surprisingly, we observe substantial boosts in performances, which points to the potential of adapting a subset of the model's parameters in the transductive few-shot setting. We report comprehensive evaluations, which show that LIMO outperforms the very recent transductive few-shot CLIP methods by a large margin and yields significant gains over the best-performing inductive methods. Our code is publicly available at:\[ \href{https://github.com/ghassenbaklouti/LIMO}{\text{here}} \]</p></details> |  |
| **[EZ-Sort: Efficient Pairwise Comparison via Zero-Shot CLIP-Based Pre-Ordering and Human-in-the-Loop Sorting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21550v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pairwise comparison is often favored over absolute rating or ordinal classification in subjective or difficult annotation tasks due to its improved reliability. However, exhaustive comparisons require a massive number of annotations (O(n^2)). Recent work has greatly reduced the annotation burden (O(n log n)) by actively sampling pairwise comparisons using a sorting algorithm. We further improve annotation efficiency by (1) roughly pre-ordering items using the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model hierarchically without training, and (2) replacing easy, obvious human comparisons with automated comparisons. The proposed EZ-Sort first produces a CLIP-based zero-shot pre-ordering, then initializes bucket-aware Elo scores, and finally runs an uncertainty-guided human-in-the-loop MergeSort. Validation was conducted using various datasets: face-age estimation (FGNET), historical image chronology (DHCI), and retinal image quality assessment (EyePACS). It showed that EZ-Sort reduced human annotation cost by 90.5% compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons and by 19.8% compared to prior work (when n = 100), while improving or maintaining inter-rater reliability. These results demonstrate that combining CLIP-based priors with uncertainty-aware sampling yields an efficient and scalable solution for pairwise ranking.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, Accepted at CIKM 2025 (ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management)</p></details> |
| **[InterCLIP-MEP: Interactive CLIP and Memory-Enhanced Predictor for Multi-modal Sarcasm Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16464v6)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sarcasm in social media, often expressed through text-image combinations, poses challenges for sentiment analysis and intention mining. Current multi-modal sarcasm detection methods have been demonstrated to overly rely on spurious cues within the textual modality, revealing a limited ability to genuinely identify sarcasm through nuanced text-image interactions. To solve this problem, we propose InterCLIP-MEP, which introduces Interactive CLIP (InterCLIP) with an efficient training strategy to extract enriched text-image representations by embedding cross-modal information directly into each encoder. Additionally, we design a Memory-Enhanced Predictor (MEP) with a dynamic dual-channel memory that stores valuable test sample knowledge during inference, acting as a non-parametric classifier for robust sarcasm recognition. Experiments on two benchmarks demonstrate that InterCLIP-MEP achieves state-of-the-art performance, with significant accuracy and F1 score improvements on MMSD and MMSD2.0.

| **[Towards Mechanistic Defenses Against Typographic Attacks in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20570v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to 19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility of text recognition.</p></details> |  |
| **[Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the full potential of CLIP. In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self, and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently improves their performance across eight benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025, code:https://github.com/chi-chi-zx/FSA</p></details> |

However, we observe that when adopting CLIP to such a pixel-level understanding task, unexpected bias (including class-preference bias and space-preference bias) occurs. Previous works don't explicitly model the bias, which largely constrains the segmentation performance. In this paper, we propose to explicitly model and rectify the bias existing in CLIP to facilitate the unsupervised semantic segmentation task. Specifically, we design a learnable "Reference" prompt to encode class-preference bias and a projection of the positional embedding in the vision transformer to encode space-preference bias respectively. To avoid interference, two kinds of biases are firstly independently encoded into different features, i.e., the Reference feature and the positional feature. Via a matrix multiplication between the Reference feature and the positional feature, a bias logit map is generated to explicitly represent two kinds of biases. Then we rectify the logits of CLIP via a simple element-wise subtraction. To make the rectified results smoother and more contextual, we design a mask decoder which takes the feature of CLIP and the rectified logits as input and outputs a rectified segmentation mask with the help of Gumbel-Softmax operation. A contrastive loss based on the masked visual features and the text features of different classes is imposed, which makes the bias modeling and rectification process meaningful and effective. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks including PASCAL VOC, PASCAL Context, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and COCO Stuff demonstrate that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.

By analyzing the data used in the public CLIP model's pre-training, we posit this limitation stems from a lack of negation-inclusive data. To address this, we introduce data generation pipelines that employ a large language model (LLM) and a multimodal LLM to produce negation-inclusive captions. Fine-tuning CLIP with data generated from our pipelines, we develop NegationCLIP, which enhances negation awareness while preserving the generality. Moreover, to enable a comprehensive evaluation of negation understanding, we propose NegRefCOCOg-a benchmark tailored to test VLMs' ability to interpret negation across diverse expressions and positions within a sentence. Experiments on various CLIP architectures validate the effectiveness of our data generation pipelines in enhancing CLIP's ability to perceive negation accurately. Additionally, NegationCLIP's enhanced negation awareness has practical applications across various multimodal tasks, demonstrated by performance gains in text-to-image generation and referring image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins.

How do such biases, learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all? We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias, finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally, we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias mitigation practices.</p></details> |  |

The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution, and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters, each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |

However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

With the recent advances in vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant decoder, and the SAPG technique.

However, no existing metric effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP, on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 AI4VA workshop (oral), Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/wpclip</p></details> |

Instead of using a classifier, we generate centroids in the CLIP embedding space, and images are classified based on their relative distance to said centroids. We find the centroids via K-means clustering of an unlabeled dataset, as well as using text labels to generate CLIP embeddings, to be used as centroids.

| **[Generalizable Geometric Image Caption Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15217v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models have various practical applications that demand strong reasoning abilities. Despite recent advancements, these models still struggle to solve complex geometric problems. A key challenge stems from the lack of high-quality image-text pair datasets for understanding geometric images. Furthermore, most template-based data synthesis pipelines typically fail to generalize to questions beyond their predefined templates. In this paper, we bridge this gap by introducing a complementary process of Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) into the data generation pipeline. By adopting RLVR to refine captions for geometric images synthesized from 50 basic geometric relations and using reward signals derived from mathematical problem-solving tasks, our pipeline successfully captures the key features of geometry problem-solving. This enables better task generalization and yields non-trivial improvements. Furthermore, even in out-of-distribution scenarios, the generated dataset enhances the general reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models, yielding accuracy improvements of $2.8\%\text{-}4.8\%$ in statistics, arithmetic, algebraic, and numerical tasks with non-geometric input images of MathVista and MathVerse, along with $2.4\%\text{-}3.9\%$ improvements in Art, Design, Tech, and Engineering tasks in MMMU.</p></details> |  |
| **[FlowRL: Matching Reward Distributions for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15207v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FlowRL: matching the full reward distribution via flow balancing instead of maximizing rewards in large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning (RL). Recent advanced reasoning models adopt reward-maximizing methods (\eg, PPO and GRPO), which tend to over-optimize dominant reward signals while neglecting less frequent but valid reasoning paths, thus reducing diversity. In contrast, we transform scalar rewards into a normalized target distribution using a learnable partition function, and then minimize the reverse KL divergence between the policy and the target distribution. We implement this idea as a flow-balanced optimization method that promotes diverse exploration and generalizable reasoning trajectories. We conduct experiments on math and code reasoning tasks: FlowRL achieves a significant average improvement of $10.0\%$ over GRPO and $5.1\%$ over PPO on math benchmarks, and performs consistently better on code reasoning tasks. These results highlight reward distribution-matching as a key step toward efficient exploration and diverse reasoning in LLM reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolving Language Models without Labels: Majority Drives Selection, Novelty Promotes Variation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15194v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), yet real-world deployment demands models that can self-improve without labels or external judges. Existing label-free methods, confidence minimization, self-consistency, or majority-vote objectives, stabilize learning but steadily shrink exploration, causing an entropy collapse: generations become shorter, less diverse, and brittle. Unlike prior approaches such as Test-Time Reinforcement Learning (TTRL), which primarily adapt models to the immediate unlabeled dataset at hand, our goal is broader: to enable general improvements without sacrificing the model's inherent exploration capacity and generalization ability, i.e., evolving. We formalize this issue and propose EVolution-Oriented and Label-free Reinforcement Learning (EVOL-RL), a simple rule that couples stability with variation under a label-free setting. EVOL-RL keeps the majority-voted answer as a stable anchor (selection) while adding a novelty-aware reward that favors responses whose reasoning differs from what has already been produced (variation), measured in semantic space. Implemented with GRPO, EVOL-RL also uses asymmetric clipping to preserve strong signals and an entropy regularizer to sustain search. This majority-for-selection + novelty-for-variation design prevents collapse, maintains longer and more informative chains of thought, and improves both pass@1 and pass@n. EVOL-RL consistently outperforms the majority-only TTRL baseline; e.g., training on label-free AIME24 lifts Qwen3-4B-Base AIME25 pass@1 from TTRL's 4.6% to 16.4%, and pass@16 from 18.5% to 37.9%. EVOL-RL not only prevents diversity collapse but also unlocks stronger generalization across domains (e.g., GPQA). Furthermore, we demonstrate that EVOL-RL also boosts performance in the RLVR setting, highlighting its broad applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Internalizing Self-Consistency in Language Models: Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15172v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are inconsistent reasoners, often generating contradictory responses to identical prompts. While inference-time methods can mitigate these inconsistencies, they fail to address the core problem: LMs struggle to reliably select reasoning pathways leading to consistent outcomes under exploratory sampling. To address this, we formalize self-consistency as an intrinsic property of well-aligned reasoning models and introduce Multi-Agent Consensus Alignment (MACA), a reinforcement learning framework that post-trains models to favor reasoning trajectories aligned with their internal consensus using majority/minority outcomes from multi-agent debate. These trajectories emerge from deliberative exchanges where agents ground reasoning in peer arguments, not just aggregation of independent attempts, creating richer consensus signals than single-round majority voting. MACA enables agents to teach themselves to be more decisive and concise, and better leverage peer insights in multi-agent settings without external supervision, driving substantial improvements across self-consistency (+27.6% on GSM8K), single-agent reasoning (+23.7% on MATH), sampling-based inference (+22.4% Pass@20 on MATH), and multi-agent ensemble decision-making (+42.7% on MathQA). These findings, coupled with strong generalization to unseen benchmarks (+16.3% on GPQA, +11.6% on CommonsenseQA), demonstrate robust self-alignment that more reliably unlocks latent reasoning potential of language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Test-Function Approach to Incremental Stability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00695v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel framework for analyzing Incremental-Input-to-State Stability ($\delta$ISS) based on the idea of using rewards as "test functions." Whereas control theory traditionally deals with Lyapunov functions that satisfy a time-decrease condition, reinforcement learning (RL) value functions are constructed by exponentially decaying a Lipschitz reward function that may be non-smooth and unbounded on both sides. Thus, these RL-style value functions cannot be directly understood as Lyapunov certificates. We develop a new equivalence between a variant of incremental input-to-state stability of a closed-loop system under given a policy, and the regularity of RL-style value functions under adversarial selection of a H\"older-continuous reward function. This result highlights that the regularity of value functions, and their connection to incremental stability, can be understood in a way that is distinct from the traditional Lyapunov-based approach to certifying stability in control theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; updated stability definitions</p></details> |
| **[Self-Improving Embodied Foundation Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15155v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage, Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill acquisition in robotics.

We introduce MEDFACT-R1, a two-stage framework that integrates external knowledge grounding with reinforcement learning to improve the factual medical reasoning. The first stage uses pseudo-label supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to incorporate external factual expertise; while the second stage applies Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with four tailored factual reward signals to encourage self-consistent reasoning. Across three public medical QA benchmarks, MEDFACT-R1 delivers up to 22.5% absolute improvement in factual accuracy over previous state-of-the-art methods. Ablation studies highlight the necessity of pseudo-label SFT cold start and validate the contribution of each GRPO reward, underscoring the synergy between knowledge grounding and RL-driven reasoning for trustworthy medical AI.

| **[Self-Adapting Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10943v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are powerful but static; they lack mechanisms to adapt their weights in response to new tasks, knowledge, or examples. We introduce Self-Adapting LLMs (SEAL), a framework that enables LLMs to self-adapt by generating their own finetuning data and update directives. Given a new input, the model produces a self-edit-a generation that may restructure the information in different ways, specify optimization hyperparameters, or invoke tools for data augmentation and gradient-based updates. Through supervised finetuning (SFT), these self-edits result in persistent weight updates, enabling lasting adaptation. To train the model to produce effective self-edits, we use a reinforcement learning loop with the downstream performance of the updated model as the reward signal. Unlike prior approaches that rely on separate adaptation modules or auxiliary networks, SEAL directly uses the model's own generation to control its adaptation process. Experiments on knowledge incorporation and few-shot generalization show that SEAL is a promising step toward language models capable of self-directed adaptation.

| **[TDRM: Smooth Reward Models with Temporal Difference for LLM RL and Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15110v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reward models are central to both reinforcement learning (RL) with language models and inference-time verification. However, existing reward models often lack temporal consistency, leading to ineffective policy updates and unstable RL training. We introduce TDRM, a method for learning smoother and more reliable reward models by minimizing temporal differences during training. This temporal-difference (TD) regularization produces smooth rewards and improves alignment with long-term objectives. Incorporating TDRM into the actor-critic style online RL loop yields consistent empirical gains. It is worth noting that TDRM is a supplement to verifiable reward methods, and both can be used in series. Experiments show that TD-trained process reward models (PRMs) improve performance across Best-of-N (up to 6.6%) and tree-search (up to 23.7%) settings. When combined with Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), TD-trained PRMs lead to more data-efficient RL -- achieving comparable performance with just 2.5k data to what baseline methods require 50.1k data to attain -- and yield higher-quality language model policies on 8 model variants (5 series), e.g., Qwen2.5-(0.5B, 1,5B), GLM4-9B-0414, GLM-Z1-9B-0414, Qwen2.5-Math-(1.5B, 7B), and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-(1.5B, 7B).

In this paper, we study this Vulnerable Agent Identification (VAI) problem in large-scale multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). We frame VAI as a Hierarchical Adversarial Decentralized Mean Field Control (HAD-MFC), where the upper level involves an NP-hard combinatorial task of selecting the most vulnerable agents, and the lower level learns worst-case adversarial policies for these agents using mean-field MARL. The two problems are coupled together, making HAD-MFC difficult to solve. To solve this, we first decouple the hierarchical process by Fenchel-Rockafellar transform, resulting a regularized mean-field Bellman operator for upper level that enables independent learning at each level, thus reducing computational complexity. We then reformulate the upper-level combinatorial problem as a MDP with dense rewards from our regularized mean-field Bellman operator, enabling us to sequentially identify the most vulnerable agents by greedy and RL algorithms. This decomposition provably preserves the optimal solution of the original HAD-MFC. Experiments show our method effectively identifies more vulnerable agents in large-scale MARL and the rule-based system, fooling system into worse failures, and learns a value function that reveals the vulnerability of each agent.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to NIPS 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, a digital twin (DT)-based cooperative driving system with roadside unit (RSU)-centric architecture is proposed for enhancing safety and efficiency at unsignalized intersections. The system leverages comprehensive bird-eye-view (BEV) perception to eliminate blind spots and employs a hybrid reinforcement learning (RL) framework combining offline pre-training with online fine-tuning. Specifically, driving policies are initially trained using conservative Q-learning (CQL) with behavior cloning (BC) on real datasets, then fine-tuned using multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) with self-attention mechanisms to handle dynamic multi-agent coordination. The RSU implements real-time commands via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications. Experimental results show that the proposed method yields failure rates below 0.03\% coordinating up to three connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), significantly outperforming traditional methods. In addition, the system exhibits sub-linear computational scaling with inference times under 40 ms. Furthermore, it demonstrates robust generalization across diverse unsignalized intersection scenarios, indicating its practicality and readiness for real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Reinforcement Learning for Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08827v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we survey recent advances in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for reasoning with Large Language Models (LLMs). RL has achieved remarkable success in advancing the frontier of LLM capabilities, particularly in addressing complex logical tasks such as mathematics and coding. As a result, RL has emerged as a foundational methodology for transforming LLMs into LRMs. With the rapid progress of the field, further scaling of RL for LRMs now faces foundational challenges not only in computational resources but also in algorithm design, training data, and infrastructure. To this end, it is timely to revisit the development of this domain, reassess its trajectory, and explore strategies to enhance the scalability of RL toward Artificial SuperIntelligence (ASI). In particular, we examine research applying RL to LLMs and LRMs for reasoning abilities, especially since the release of DeepSeek-R1, including foundational components, core problems, training resources, and downstream applications, to identify future opportunities and directions for this rapidly evolving area. We hope this review will promote future research on RL for broader reasoning models.

| **[Reinforcement Learning Agent for a 2D Shooter Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15042v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning agents in complex game environments often suffer from sparse rewards, training instability, and poor sample efficiency. This paper presents a hybrid training approach that combines offline imitation learning with online reinforcement learning for a 2D shooter game agent. We implement a multi-head neural network with separate outputs for behavioral cloning and Q-learning, unified by shared feature extraction layers with attention mechanisms. Initial experiments using pure deep Q-Networks exhibited significant instability, with agents frequently reverting to poor policies despite occasional good performance. To address this, we developed a hybrid methodology that begins with behavioral cloning on demonstration data from rule-based agents, then transitions to reinforcement learning. Our hybrid approach achieves consistently above 70% win rate against rule-based opponents, substantially outperforming pure reinforcement learning methods which showed high variance and frequent performance degradation. The multi-head architecture enables effective knowledge transfer between learning modes while maintaining training stability. Results demonstrate that combining demonstration-based initialization with reinforcement learning optimization provides a robust solution for developing game AI agents in complex multi-agent environments where pure exploration proves insufficient.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mastering Multi-Drone Volleyball through Hierarchical Co-Self-Play Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04317v4)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle the problem of learning to play 3v3 multi-drone volleyball, a new embodied competitive task that requires both high-level strategic coordination and low-level agile control. The task is turn-based, multi-agent, and physically grounded, posing significant challenges due to its long-horizon dependencies, tight inter-agent coupling, and the underactuated dynamics of quadrotors. To address this, we propose Hierarchical Co-Self-Play (HCSP), a hierarchical reinforcement learning framework that separates centralized high-level strategic decision-making from decentralized low-level motion control. We design a three-stage population-based training pipeline to enable both strategy and skill to emerge from scratch without expert demonstrations: (I) training diverse low-level skills, (II) learning high-level strategy via self-play with fixed low-level skills, and (III) joint fine-tuning through co-self-play. Experiments show that HCSP achieves superior performance, outperforming non-hierarchical self-play and rule-based hierarchical baselines with an average 82.9% win rate and a 71.5% win rate against the two-stage variant. Moreover, co-self-play leads to emergent team behaviors such as role switching and coordinated formations, demonstrating the effectiveness of our hierarchical design and training scheme.

Traditional experience replay (ER) methods, especially those using TD-error prioritization, struggle to distinguish between changes caused by the agent's policy and those from the environment, resulting in inefficient learning under dynamic conditions. To address this challenge, we propose the Discrepancy of Environment Dynamics (DoE), a metric that isolates the effects of environment shifts on value functions. Building on this, we introduce Discrepancy of Environment Prioritized Experience Replay (DEER), an adaptive ER framework that prioritizes transitions based on both policy updates and environmental changes. DEER uses a binary classifier to detect environment changes and applies distinct prioritization strategies before and after each shift, enabling more sample-efficient learning. Experiments on four non-stationary benchmarks demonstrate that DEER further improves the performance of off-policy algorithms by 11.54 percent compared to the best-performing state-of-the-art ER methods.</p></details> | 5 pages, 3 figures |

To get the reasonable editing performance, these methods often require the user to brute-force tune multiple interdependent hyperparameters, such as inversion timesteps and attention modification, \textit{etc.} This process incurs high computational costs due to the huge hyperparameter search space. We consider searching optimal editing's hyperparameters as a sequential decision-making task within the diffusion denoising process. Specifically, we propose a reinforcement learning framework, which establishes a Markov Decision Process that dynamically adjusts hyperparameters across denoising steps, integrating editing objectives into a reward function. The method achieves time efficiency through proximal policy optimization while maintaining optimal hyperparameter configurations. Experiments demonstrate significant reduction in search time and computational overhead compared to existing brute-force approaches, advancing the practical deployment of a diffusion-based image editing framework in the real world.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Yet it remains a challenging problem, as effective systems must robustly handle unseen worksite conditions and new hardware configurations. Current state-of-the-art approaches rely on highly engineered, task-specific controllers, which require extensive manual tuning for each new scenario. In contrast, recent advances in large-scale pretrained models have shown remarkable adaptability across tasks and embodiments in domains such as manipulation and navigation, but their applicability to heavy construction machinery remains largely unexplored. In this work, we introduce ExT, a unified open-source framework for large-scale demonstration collection, pretraining, and fine-tuning of multitask excavation policies. ExT policies are first trained on large-scale demonstrations collected from a mix of experts, then fine-tuned either with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning fine-tuning (RLFT) to specialize to new tasks or operating conditions. Through both simulation and real-world experiments, we show that pretrained ExT policies can execute complete excavation cycles with centimeter-level accuracy, successfully transferring from simulation to real machine with performance comparable to specialized single-task controllers. Furthermore, in simulation, we demonstrate that ExT's fine-tuning pipelines allow rapid adaptation to new tasks, out-of-distribution conditions, and machine configurations, while maintaining strong performance on previously learned tasks. These results highlight the potential of ExT to serve as a foundation for scalable and generalizable autonomous excavation.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Role of Touch: Towards Optimal Tactile Sensing Distribution in Anthropomorphic Hands for Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14984v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-hand manipulation tasks, particularly in human-inspired robotic systems, must rely on distributed tactile sensing to achieve precise control across a wide variety of tasks. However, the optimal configuration of this network of sensors is a complex problem, and while the fingertips are a common choice for placing sensors, the contribution of tactile information from other regions of the hand is often overlooked. This work investigates the impact of tactile feedback from various regions of the fingers and palm in performing in-hand object reorientation tasks. We analyze how sensory feedback from different parts of the hand influences the robustness of deep reinforcement learning control policies and investigate the relationship between object characteristics and optimal sensor placement. We identify which tactile sensing configurations contribute to improving the efficiency and accuracy of manipulation. Our results provide valuable insights for the design and use of anthropomorphic end-effectors with enhanced manipulation capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traffic Co-Simulation Framework Empowered by Infrastructure Camera Sensing and Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03925v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traffic simulations are commonly used to optimize urban traffic flow, with reinforcement learning (RL) showing promising potential for automated traffic signal control, particularly in intelligent transportation systems involving connected automated vehicles. Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is particularly effective for learning control strategies for traffic lights in a network using iterative simulations. However, existing methods often assume perfect vehicle detection, which overlooks real-world limitations related to infrastructure availability and sensor reliability. This study proposes a co-simulation framework integrating CARLA and SUMO, which combines high-fidelity 3D modeling with large-scale traffic flow simulation. Cameras mounted on traffic light poles within the CARLA environment use a YOLO-based computer vision system to detect and count vehicles, providing real-time traffic data as input for adaptive signal control in SUMO. MARL agents trained with four different reward structures leverage this visual feedback to optimize signal timings and improve network-wide traffic flow. Experiments in a multi-intersection test-bed demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed MARL approach in enhancing traffic conditions using real-time camera based detection. The framework also evaluates the robustness of MARL under faulty or sparse sensing and compares the performance of YOLOv5 and YOLOv8 for vehicle detection. Results show that while better accuracy improves performance, MARL agents can still achieve significant improvements with imperfect detection, demonstrating scalability and adaptability for real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

We focus on the stochastic setting that the algorithm can access the unbiased stochastic gradient evaluation with heavy-tailed noise, which is prevalent in many machine learning applications such as training large language models and reinforcement learning. We propose a nested-loop normalized stochastic bilevel approximation (N$^2$SBA) for finding an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big(\kappa^{\frac{7p-3}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}} \epsilon^{-\frac{4 p - 2}{p-1}}\big)$, where $\kappa$ is the condition number, $p\in(1,2]$ is the order of central moment for the noise, and $\sigma$ is the noise level. Furthermore, we specialize our idea to solve the nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problem, achieving an $\epsilon$-stationary point with the SFO complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal O}\big(\kappa^{\frac{2p-1}{p-1}} \sigma^{\frac{p}{p-1}} \epsilon^{-\frac{3p-2}{p-1}}\big)$. All above upper bounds match the best-known results under the special case of the bounded variance setting, i.e., $p=2$.</p></details> |  |

To address these issues, we introduce DART, a novel framework that enhances a diffusion-based policy with affordance learning and linear temporal logic (LTL) representations to improve the learning efficiency and generalizability of articulated dexterous manipulation. Specifically, DART leverages LTL to understand task semantics and affordance learning to identify optimal interaction points. The {diffusion-based policy} then generalizes these interactions across various categories. Additionally, we exploit an optimization method based on interaction data to refine actions, overcoming the limitations of traditional diffusion policies that typically rely on offline reinforcement learning or learning from demonstrations. Experimental results demonstrate that DART outperforms most existing methods in manipulation ability, generalization performance, transfer reasoning, and robustness.

Their black-box characteristic hinders interpretability and reduces trustworthiness, particularly in critical domains. To address this challenge in RL tasks, we propose a solution based on Self-Explaining Neural Networks (SENNs) along with explanation extraction methods to enhance interpretability while maintaining predictive accuracy. Our approach targets low-dimensionality problems to generate robust local and global explanations of the model's behaviour. We evaluate the proposed method on the resource allocation problem in mobile networks, demonstrating that SENNs can constitute interpretable solutions with competitive performance. This work highlights the potential of SENNs to improve transparency and trust in AI-driven decision-making for low-dimensional tasks. Our approach strong performance on par with the existing state-of-the-art methods, while providing robust explanations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Reinforcement Learning, Genetic Algorithms and Transformers for background determination in particle physics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14894v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Experimental studies of beauty hadron decays face significant challenges due to a wide range of backgrounds arising from the numerous possible decay channels with similar final states. For a particular signal decay, the process for ascertaining the most relevant background processes necessitates a detailed analysis of final state particles, potential misidentifications, and kinematic overlaps, which, due to computational limitations, is restricted to the simulation of only the most relevant backgrounds. Moreover, this process typically relies on the physicist's intuition and expertise, as no systematic method exists. This paper has two primary goals. First, from a particle physics perspective, we present a novel approach that utilises Reinforcement Learning (RL) to overcome the aforementioned challenges by systematically determining the critical backgrounds affecting beauty hadron decay measurements. While beauty hadron physics serves as the case study in this work, the proposed strategy is broadly adaptable to other types of particle physics measurements. Second, from a Machine Learning perspective, we introduce a novel algorithm which exploits the synergy between RL and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for environments with highly sparse rewards and a large trajectory space. This strategy leverages GAs to efficiently explore the trajectory space and identify successful trajectories, which are used to guide the RL agent's training. Our method also incorporates a transformer architecture for the RL agent to handle token sequences representing decays.</p></details> | 32 pages, 12 figures |

However, existing Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate replies that are semantically fluent but lack the structured reasoning necessary for genuine psychological support, particularly in a Chinese context. To bridge this gap, we introduce Empathy-R1, a novel framework that integrates a Chain-of-Empathy (CoE) reasoning process with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to enhance response quality for LCTs. Inspired by cognitive-behavioral therapy, our CoE paradigm guides the model to sequentially reason about a help-seeker's emotions, causes, and intentions, making its thinking process both transparent and interpretable. Our framework is empowered by a new large-scale Chinese dataset, Empathy-QA, and a two-stage training process. First, Supervised Fine-Tuning instills the CoE's reasoning structure. Subsequently, RL, guided by a dedicated reward model, refines the therapeutic relevance and contextual appropriateness of the final responses. Experiments show that Empathy-R1 achieves strong performance on key automatic metrics. More importantly, human evaluations confirm its superiority, showing a clear preference over strong baselines and achieving a Win@1 rate of 44.30% on our new benchmark. By enabling interpretable and contextually nuanced responses, Empathy-R1 represents a significant advancement in developing responsible and genuinely beneficial AI for mental health support.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Fidelity Hybrid Reinforcement Learning via Information Gain Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14848v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing a reinforcement learning (RL) policy typically requires extensive interactions with a high-fidelity simulator of the environment, which are often costly or impractical. Offline RL addresses this problem by allowing training from pre-collected data, but its effectiveness is strongly constrained by the size and quality of the dataset. Hybrid offline-online RL leverages both offline data and interactions with a single simulator of the environment. In many real-world scenarios, however, multiple simulators with varying levels of fidelity and computational cost are available. In this work, we study multi-fidelity hybrid RL for policy optimization under a fixed cost budget. We introduce multi-fidelity hybrid RL via information gain maximization (MF-HRL-IGM), a hybrid offline-online RL algorithm that implements fidelity selection based on information gain maximization through a bootstrapping approach. Theoretical analysis establishes the no-regret property of MF-HRL-IGM, while empirical evaluations demonstrate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

We propose Diffusion Scenario Tree (DST), a general framework for constructing scenario trees for multivariate prediction tasks using diffusion-based probabilistic forecasting models. DST recursively samples future trajectories and organizes them into a tree via clustering, ensuring non-anticipativity (decisions depending only on observed history) at each stage. We evaluate the framework on the optimization task of energy arbitrage in New York State's day-ahead electricity market. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms the same optimization algorithms that use scenario trees from more conventional models and Model-Free Reinforcement Learning baselines. Furthermore, using DST for stochastic optimization yields more efficient decision policies, achieving higher performance by better handling uncertainty than deterministic and stochastic MPC variants using the same diffusion-based forecaster.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables, and 1 algorithm.

| **[Scalable Multi-Objective Robot Reinforcement Learning through Gradient Conflict Resolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14816v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) robot controllers usually aggregate many task objectives into one scalar reward. While large-scale proximal policy optimisation (PPO) has enabled impressive results such as robust robot locomotion in the real world, many tasks still require careful reward tuning and are brittle to local optima. Tuning cost and sub-optimality grow with the number of objectives, limiting scalability. Modelling reward vectors and their trade-offs can address these issues; however, multi-objective methods remain underused in RL for robotics because of computational cost and optimisation difficulty. In this work, we investigate the conflict between gradient contributions for each objective that emerge from scalarising the task objectives. In particular, we explicitly address the conflict between task-based rewards and terms that regularise the policy towards realistic behaviour. We propose GCR-PPO, a modification to actor-critic optimisation that decomposes the actor update into objective-wise gradients using a multi-headed critic and resolves conflicts based on the objective priority. Our methodology, GCR-PPO, is evaluated on the well-known IsaacLab manipulation and locomotion benchmarks and additional multi-objective modifications on two related tasks. We show superior scalability compared to parallel PPO (p = 0.04), without significant computational overhead. We also show higher performance with more conflicting tasks. GCR-PPO improves on large-scale PPO with an average improvement of 9.5%, with high-conflict tasks observing a greater improvement.

However, their robustness, especially on heterogeneous graphs, remains underexplored, particularly against adversarial attacks. This paper proposes HeteroKRLAttack, a targeted evasion black-box attack method for heterogeneous graphs. By integrating reinforcement learning with a Top-K algorithm to reduce the action space, our method efficiently identifies effective attack strategies to disrupt node classification tasks. We validate the effectiveness of HeteroKRLAttack through experiments on multiple heterogeneous graph datasets, showing significant reductions in classification accuracy compared to baseline methods. An ablation study underscores the critical role of the Top-K algorithm in enhancing attack performance. Our findings highlight potential vulnerabilities in current models and provide guidance for future defense strategies against adversarial attacks on heterogeneous graphs.</p></details> |  |

Existing correct-by-construction synthesis algorithms for such filters, however, suffer from the curse-of-dimensionality. Deep learning approaches have been proposed in recent years to address this challenge. In this paper, we add to this set of approaches an algorithm for training neural control barrier functions from offline datasets. Such functions can be used to design constraints for quadratic programs that are then used as safety filters. Our algorithm trains these functions so that the system is not only prevented from reaching unsafe states but is also disincentivized from reaching out-of-distribution ones, at which they would be less reliable. It is inspired by Conservative Q-learning, an offline reinforcement learning algorithm. We call its outputs Conservative Control Barrier Functions (CCBFs). Our empirical results demonstrate that CCBFs outperform existing methods in maintaining safety while minimally affecting task performance.

While prior works have addressed unsupervised image segmentation, they significantly lag behind supervised models. In this paper, we use a diffusion UNet encoder as a foundation vision encoder and introduce DiffCut, an unsupervised zero-shot segmentation method that solely harnesses the output features from the final self-attention block. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that the utilization of these diffusion features in a graph based segmentation algorithm, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on zero-shot segmentation. Specifically, we leverage a recursive Normalized Cut algorithm that softly regulates the granularity of detected objects and produces well-defined segmentation maps that precisely capture intricate image details. Our work highlights the remarkably accurate semantic knowledge embedded within diffusion UNet encoders that could then serve as foundation vision encoders for downstream tasks.

We focus on the semi-supervised setting, where only a few labeled 3D medical images are available, along with a large set of unlabeled images. To tackle this, we propose a model-agnostic framework that progressively distills knowledge from a 2D pretrained model to a 3D segmentation model trained from scratch. Our approach, M&N, involves iterative co-training of the two models using pseudo-masks generated by each other, along with our proposed learning rate guided sampling that adaptively adjusts the proportion of labeled and unlabeled data in each training batch to align with the models' prediction accuracy and stability, minimizing the adverse effect caused by inaccurate pseudo-masks. Extensive experiments on multiple publicly available datasets demonstrate that M&N achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming thirteen existing semi-supervised segmentation approaches under all different settings. Importantly, ablation studies show that M&N remains model-agnostic, allowing seamless integration with different architectures. This ensures its adaptability as more advanced models emerge.

Despite their success, conventional skip connections exhibit two key limitations: inter-feature constraints and intra-feature constraints. The inter-feature constraint refers to the static nature of feature fusion in traditional skip connections, where information is transmitted along fixed pathways regardless of feature content. The intra-feature constraint arises from the insufficient modeling of multi-scale feature interactions, thereby hindering the effective aggregation of global contextual information. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Skip Connection (DSC) block that fundamentally enhances cross-layer connectivity through adaptive mechanisms. The DSC block integrates two complementary components. (1) Test-Time Training (TTT) module. This module addresses the inter-feature constraint by enabling dynamic adaptation of hidden representations during inference, facilitating content-aware feature refinement. (2) Dynamic Multi-Scale Kernel (DMSK) module. To mitigate the intra-feature constraint, this module adaptively selects kernel sizes based on global contextual cues, enhancing the network capacity for multi-scale feature integration. The DSC block is architecture-agnostic and can be seamlessly incorporated into existing U-like network structures. Extensive experiments demonstrate the plug-and-play effectiveness of the proposed DSC block across CNN-based, Transformer-based, hybrid CNN-Transformer, and Mamba-based U-like networks.</p></details> |  |

However, attaching undue importance to global context modeling may inadvertently compromise critical local structural information, thus leading to boundary ambiguity and regional distortion in segmentation outputs. Therefore, we propose the HybridMamba, an architecture employing dual complementary mechanisms: 1) a feature scanning strategy that progressively integrates representations both axial-traversal and local-adaptive pathways to harmonize the relationship between local and global representations, and 2) a gated module combining spatial-frequency analysis for comprehensive contextual modeling. Besides, we collect a multi-center CT dataset related to lung cancer. Experiments on MRI and CT datasets demonstrate that HybridMamba significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in 3D medical image segmentation.</p></details> |  |

Existing deep models either blur fine edge details or rely on handcrafted filters that perform poorly under variable imaging conditions. We propose MEGANet-W, a Wavelet Driven Edge Guided Attention Network that injects directional, parameter free Haar wavelet edge maps into each decoder stage to recalibrate semantic features. The key novelties of MEGANet-W include a two-level Haar wavelet head for multi-orientation edge extraction; and Wavelet Edge Guided Attention (W-EGA) modules that fuse wavelet cues with boundary and input branches. On five public polyp datasets, MEGANet-W consistently outperforms existing methods, improving mIoU by up to 2.3% and mDice by 1.2%, while introducing no additional learnable parameters. This approach improves reliability in difficult cases and offers a robust solution for medical image segmentation tasks requiring precise boundary detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This paper introduces Semi-MOE, to the best of our knowledge, the first multi-task Mixture-of-Experts framework for semi-supervised histopathology image segmentation. Our approach leverages three specialized expert networks: A main segmentation expert, a signed distance field regression expert, and a boundary prediction expert, each dedicated to capturing distinct morphological features. Subsequently, the Multi-Gating Pseudo-labeling module dynamically aggregates expert features, enabling a robust fuse-and-refine pseudo-labeling mechanism. Furthermore, to eliminate manual tuning while dynamically balancing multiple learning objectives, we propose an Adaptive Multi-Objective Loss.

However, adapting MLLM to segmentation is computationally intensive, primarily due to visual token redundancy. We observe that traditional patch-wise visual projectors struggle to strike a balance between reducing the number of visual tokens and preserving semantic clarity, often retaining overly long token sequences to avoid performance drops. Inspired by text tokenizers, we propose a novel semantic visual projector that leverages semantic superpixels generated by SAM to identify "visual words" in an image. By compressing and projecting semantic superpixels as visual tokens, our approach adaptively shortens the token sequence according to scene complexity while minimizing semantic loss in compression. To mitigate loss of information, we propose a semantic superpixel positional embedding to strengthen MLLM's awareness of superpixel geometry and position, alongside a semantic superpixel aggregator to preserve both fine-grained details inside superpixels and global context outside. Experiments show that our method cuts visual tokens by 93% without compromising performance, notably speeding up MLLM training and inference, and outperforming existing compressive visual projectors on RIS.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a new distributed approach to identify as well as locate deforestation across different clients using Federated Learning (FL). Federated Learning enables distributed network clients to collaboratively train a model while maintaining data privacy and security of the active users. In our framework, a client corresponds to an edge satellite center responsible for local data processing. Moreover, FL provides an advantage over centralized training method which requires combining data, thereby compromising with data security of the clients. Our framework leverages the FLOWER framework with RAY framework to execute the distributed learning workload. Furthermore, efficient client spawning is ensured by RAY as it can select definite amount of users to create an emulation environment. Our FL framework uses YOLOS-small (a Vision Transformer variant), Faster R-CNN with a ResNet50 backbone, and Faster R-CNN with a MobileNetV3 backbone models trained and tested on publicly available datasets. Our approach provides us a different view for image segmentation-based tasks on satellite imagery.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted at IEEE INDISCON 2025</p></details> |

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/hugocarlesso/CMTSSL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Dual Network Based Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation with Uncertainty-Guided Pseudo-Labeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13084v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges, this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings (e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed modules is further validated via ablation experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted in Knowledge-Based Systems</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS), Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM), which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes. Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation introduced in earlier stages.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module (DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for clinical medical image analysis.

However, existing methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective: highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at https://github.com/SijuMa2003/RIS-FUSION.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[A Computational Pipeline for Patient-Specific Modeling of Thoracic Aortic Aneurysm: From Medical Image to Finite Element Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12596v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The aorta is the body's largest arterial vessel, serving as the primary pathway for oxygenated blood within the systemic circulation. Aortic aneurysms consistently rank among the top twenty causes of mortality in the United States. Thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) arises from abnormal dilation of the thoracic aorta and remains a clinically significant disease, ranking as one of the leading causes of death in adults. A thoracic aortic aneurysm ruptures when the integrity of all aortic wall layers is compromised due to elevated blood pressure. Currently, three-dimensional computed tomography (3D CT) is considered the gold standard for diagnosing TAA. The geometric characteristics of the aorta, which can be quantified from medical imaging, and stresses on the aortic wall, which can be obtained by finite element analysis (FEA), are critical in evaluating the risk of rupture and dissection. Deep learning based image segmentation has emerged as a reliable method for extracting anatomical regions of interest from medical images. Voxel based segmentation masks of anatomical structures are typically converted into structured mesh representation to enable accurate simulation. Hexahedral meshes are commonly used in finite element simulations of the aorta due to their computational efficiency and superior simulation accuracy. Due to anatomical variability, patient specific modeling enables detailed assessment of individual anatomical and biomechanics behaviors, supporting precise simulations, accurate diagnoses, and personalized treatment strategies. Finite element (FE) simulations provide valuable insights into the biomechanical behaviors of tissues and organs in clinical studies. Developing accurate FE models represents a crucial initial step in establishing a patient-specific, biomechanically based framework for predicting the risk of TAA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Efficient Open-Vocabulary Segmentation in the Remote Sensing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12040v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Vocabulary Remote Sensing Image Segmentation (OVRSIS), an emerging task that adapts Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) to the remote sensing (RS) domain, remains underexplored due to the absence of a unified evaluation benchmark and the domain gap between natural and RS images. To bridge these gaps, we first establish a standardized OVRSIS benchmark (\textbf{OVRSISBench}) based on widely-used RS segmentation datasets, enabling consistent evaluation across methods. Using this benchmark, we comprehensively evaluate several representative OVS/OVRSIS models and reveal their limitations when directly applied to remote sensing scenarios. Building on these insights, we propose \textbf{RSKT-Seg}, a novel open-vocabulary segmentation framework tailored for remote sensing. RSKT-Seg integrates three key components: (1) a Multi-Directional Cost Map Aggregation (RS-CMA) module that captures rotation-invariant visual cues by computing vision-language cosine similarities across multiple directions; (2) an Efficient Cost Map Fusion (RS-Fusion) transformer, which jointly models spatial and semantic dependencies with a lightweight dimensionality reduction strategy; and (3) a Remote Sensing Knowledge Transfer (RS-Transfer) module that injects pre-trained knowledge and facilitates domain adaptation via enhanced upsampling. Extensive experiments on the benchmark show that RSKT-Seg consistently outperforms strong OVS baselines by +3.8 mIoU and +5.9 mACC, while achieving 2x faster inference through efficient aggregation.

However, it fails when applied to medical image segmentation (MIS) and infrared small target segmentation (IRSTS) due to limited data and limited fitting capacity. In this paper, we propose a new type of dynamic convolution called dynamic parameter convolution (DPConv) which shows superior fitting capacity, and it can efficiently leverage features from deep layers of encoder in reconstruction tasks to generate DPConv kernels that adapt to input variations.Moreover, we observe that DPConv, built upon deep features derived from reconstruction tasks, significantly enhances downstream segmentation performance. We refer to the segmentation network integrated with DPConv generated from reconstruction network as the siamese reconstruction-segmentation network (SRS). We conduct extensive experiments on seven datasets including five medical datasets and two infrared datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method can show superior performance over several recently proposed methods. Furthermore, the zero-shot segmentation under unseen modality demonstrates the generalization of DPConv.

| **[Uncertainty-Aware Retinal Vessel Segmentation via Ensemble Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11689v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty estimation is critical for reliable medical image segmentation, particularly in retinal vessel analysis, where accurate predictions are essential for diagnostic applications. Deep Ensembles, where multiple networks are trained individually, are widely used to improve medical image segmentation performance. However, training and testing costs increase with the number of ensembles. In this work, we propose Ensemble Distillation as a robust alternative to commonly used uncertainty estimation techniques by distilling the knowledge of multiple ensemble models into a single model. Through extensive experiments on the DRIVE and FIVES datasets, we demonstrate that Ensemble Distillation achieves comparable performance via calibration and segmentation metrics, while significantly reducing computational complexity. These findings suggest that Ensemble distillation provides an efficient and reliable approach for uncertainty estimation in the segmentation of the retinal vessels, making it a promising tool for medical imaging applications.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figure |
| **[3D Reconstruction of Coronary Vessel Trees from Biplanar X-Ray Images Using a Geometric Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13358v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>X-ray angiography is widely used in cardiac interventions to visualize coronary vessels, assess integrity, detect stenoses and guide treatment. We propose a framework for reconstructing 3D vessel trees from biplanar X-ray images which are extracted from two X-ray videos captured at different C-arm angles. The proposed framework consists of three main components: image segmentation, motion phase matching, and 3D reconstruction. An automatic video segmentation method for X-ray angiography to enable semantic segmentation for image segmentation and motion phase matching. The goal of the motion phase matching is to identify a pair of X-ray images that correspond to a similar respiratory and cardiac motion phase to reduce errors in 3D reconstruction. This is achieved by tracking a stationary object such as a catheter or lead within the X-ray video. The semantic segmentation approach assigns different labels to different object classes enabling accurate differentiation between blood vessels, balloons, and catheters. Once a suitable image pair is selected, key anatomical landmarks (vessel branching points and endpoints) are matched between the two views using a heuristic method that minimizes reconstruction errors. This is followed by a novel geometric reconstruction algorithm to generate the 3D vessel tree. The algorithm computes the 3D vessel centrelines by determining the intersection of two 3D surfaces. Compared to traditional methods based on epipolar constraints, the proposed approach simplifies there construction workflow and improves overall accuracy. We trained and validated our segmentation method on 62 X-ray angiography video sequences. On the test set, our method achieved a segmentation accuracy of 0.703. The 3D reconstruction framework was validated by measuring the reconstruction error of key anatomical landmarks, achieving a reprojection errors of 0.62mm +/- 0.38mm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adapting Medical Vision Foundation Models for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation via Active Learning and Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10784v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical Vision Foundation Models (Med-VFMs) have superior capabilities of interpreting medical images due to the knowledge learned from self-supervised pre-training with extensive unannotated images. To improve their performance on adaptive downstream evaluations, especially segmentation, a few samples from target domains are selected randomly for fine-tuning them. However, there lacks works to explore the way of adapting Med-VFMs to achieve the optimal performance on target domains efficiently. Thus, it is highly demanded to design an efficient way of fine-tuning Med-VFMs by selecting informative samples to maximize their adaptation performance on target domains. To achieve this, we propose an Active Source-Free Domain Adaptation (ASFDA) method to efficiently adapt Med-VFMs to target domains for volumetric medical image segmentation. This ASFDA employs a novel Active Learning (AL) method to select the most informative samples from target domains for fine-tuning Med-VFMs without the access to source pre-training samples, thus maximizing their performance with the minimal selection budget. In this AL method, we design an Active Test Time Sample Query strategy to select samples from the target domains via two query metrics, including Diversified Knowledge Divergence (DKD) and Anatomical Segmentation Difficulty (ASD). DKD is designed to measure the source-target knowledge gap and intra-domain diversity. It utilizes the knowledge of pre-training to guide the querying of source-dissimilar and semantic-diverse samples from the target domains. ASD is designed to evaluate the difficulty in segmentation of anatomical structures by measuring predictive entropy from foreground regions adaptively. Additionally, our ASFDA method employs a Selective Semi-supervised Fine-tuning to improve the performance and efficiency of fine-tuning by identifying samples with high reliability from unqueried ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[PL-Net: Progressive Learning Network for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14484v3)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, deep convolutional neural network-based segmentation methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance for many medical analysis tasks. However, most of these approaches rely on optimizing the U-Net structure or adding new functional modules, which overlooks the complementation and fusion of coarse-grained and fine-grained semantic information. To address these issues, we propose a 2D medical image segmentation framework called Progressive Learning Network (PL-Net), which comprises Internal Progressive Learning (IPL) and External Progressive Learning (EPL). PL-Net offers the following advantages: (1) IPL divides feature extraction into two steps, allowing for the mixing of different size receptive fields and capturing semantic information from coarse to fine granularity without introducing additional parameters; (2) EPL divides the training process into two stages to optimize parameters and facilitate the fusion of coarse-grained information in the first stage and fine-grained information in the second stage. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of our proposed method on five medical image segmentation datasets, and the experimental results demonstrate that PL-Net achieves competitive segmentation performance. It is worth noting that PL-Net does not introduce any additional learnable parameters compared to other U-Net variants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Medical Image Segmentation by Modeling Evidential Calibrated Uncertainty](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.00349v4)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is critical for disease diagnosis and treatment assessment. However, concerns regarding the reliability of segmentation regions persist among clinicians, mainly attributed to the absence of confidence assessment, robustness, and calibration to accuracy. To address this, we introduce DEviS, an easily implementable foundational model that seamlessly integrates into various medical image segmentation networks. DEviS not only enhances the calibration and robustness of baseline segmentation accuracy but also provides high-efficiency uncertainty estimation for reliable predictions. By leveraging subjective logic theory, we explicitly model probability and uncertainty for medical image segmentation. Here, the Dirichlet distribution parameterizes the distribution of probabilities for different classes of the segmentation results. To generate calibrated predictions and uncertainty, we develop a trainable calibrated uncertainty penalty. Furthermore, DEviS incorporates an uncertainty-aware filtering module, which designs the metric of uncertainty-calibrated error to filter out-of-distribution data. We conducted validation studies on publicly available datasets, including ISIC2018, KiTS2021, LiTS2017, and BraTS2019, to assess the accuracy and robustness of different backbone segmentation models enhanced by DEviS, as well as the efficiency and reliability of uncertainty estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics</p></details> |

Existing efficient segmentation models are typically static and manually designed prior to training, which restricts their adaptability across diverse tasks and makes it difficult to balance performance with resource efficiency. In this paper, we propose PSP-Seg, a progressive pruning framework that enables dynamic and efficient 3D segmentation. PSP-Seg begins with a redundant model and iteratively prunes redundant modules through a combination of block-wise pruning and a functional decoupling loss. We evaluate PSP-Seg on five public datasets, benchmarking it against seven state-of-the-art models and six efficient segmentation models. Results demonstrate that the lightweight variant, PSP-Seg-S, achieves performance on par with nnU-Net while reducing GPU memory usage by 42-45%, training time by 29-48%, and parameter number by 83-87% across all datasets. These findings underscore PSP-Seg's potential as a cost-effective yet high-performing alternative for widespread clinical application.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Medverse: A Universal Model for Full-Resolution 3D Medical Image Segmentation, Transformation and Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09232v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In-context learning (ICL) offers a promising paradigm for universal medical image analysis, enabling models to perform diverse image processing tasks without retraining. However, current ICL models for medical imaging remain limited in two critical aspects: they cannot simultaneously achieve high-fidelity predictions and global anatomical understanding, and there is no unified model trained across diverse medical imaging tasks (e.g., segmentation and enhancement) and anatomical regions. As a result, the full potential of ICL in medical imaging remains underexplored. Thus, we present \textbf{Medverse}, a universal ICL model for 3D medical imaging, trained on 22 datasets covering diverse tasks in universal image segmentation, transformation, and enhancement across multiple organs, imaging modalities, and clinical centers. Medverse employs a next-scale autoregressive in-context learning framework that progressively refines predictions from coarse to fine, generating consistent, full-resolution volumetric outputs and enabling multi-scale anatomical awareness. We further propose a blockwise cross-attention module that facilitates long-range interactions between context and target inputs while preserving computational efficiency through spatial sparsity. Medverse is extensively evaluated on a broad collection of held-out datasets covering previously unseen clinical centers, organs, species, and imaging modalities. Results demonstrate that Medverse substantially outperforms existing ICL baselines and establishes a novel paradigm for in-context learning. Code and model weights will be made publicly available. Our model are publicly available at https://github.com/jiesihu/Medverse.</p></details> |  |
| **[RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO) particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the segmentation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLAPS: A CLIP-Unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation for Multi-Modal Retinal Imaging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08618v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM), have significantly impacted medical image segmentation, especially in retinal imaging, where precise segmentation is vital for diagnosis. Despite this progress, current methods face critical challenges: 1) modality ambiguity in textual disease descriptions, 2) a continued reliance on manual prompting for SAM-based workflows, and 3) a lack of a unified framework, with most methods being modality- and task-specific. To overcome these hurdles, we propose CLIP-unified Auto-Prompt Segmentation (\CLAPS), a novel method for unified segmentation across diverse tasks and modalities in retinal imaging. Our approach begins by pre-training a CLIP-based image encoder on a large, multi-modal retinal dataset to handle data scarcity and distribution imbalance. We then leverage GroundingDINO to automatically generate spatial bounding box prompts by detecting local lesions. To unify tasks and resolve ambiguity, we use text prompts enhanced with a unique "modality signature" for each imaging modality. Ultimately, these automated textual and spatial prompts guide SAM to execute precise segmentation, creating a fully automated and unified pipeline. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse datasets across 11 critical segmentation categories show that CLAPS achieves performance on par with specialized expert models while surpassing existing benchmarks across most metrics, demonstrating its broad generalizability as a foundation model.</p></details> | BIBM |
| **[Vision-Language Semantic Aggregation Leveraging Foundation Model for Generalizable Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08570v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal models have achieved remarkable success in natural image segmentation, yet they often underperform when applied to the medical domain. Through extensive study, we attribute this performance gap to the challenges of multimodal fusion, primarily the significant semantic gap between abstract textual prompts and fine-grained medical visual features, as well as the resulting feature dispersion. To address these issues, we revisit the problem from the perspective of semantic aggregation. Specifically, we propose an Expectation-Maximization (EM) Aggregation mechanism and a Text-Guided Pixel Decoder. The former mitigates feature dispersion by dynamically clustering features into compact semantic centers to enhance cross-modal correspondence. The latter is designed to bridge the semantic gap by leveraging domain-invariant textual knowledge to effectively guide deep visual representations. The synergy between these two mechanisms significantly improves the model's generalization ability. Extensive experiments on public cardiac and fundus datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing SOTA approaches across multiple domain generalization benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages and 8 figures</p></details> |

Addressing the differences in frequency band sensitivity between CNNs and the human visual system (mid-frequency sensitivity with low-frequency sensitivity surpassing high-frequency), we experimentally quantified the CNN contrast sensitivity function and proposed a wavelet adaptive spectrum fusion (WASF) method inspired by biological vision mechanisms to balance cross-frequency image features. Furthermore, we designed a perception frequency block (PFB) that integrates WASF to enhance frequency-domain feature extraction. Based on this, we developed the FE-UNet model, which employs a SAM2 backbone network and incorporates fine-tuned Hiera-Large modules to ensure segmentation accuracy while improving generalization capability. Experiments demonstrate that FE-UNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain tasks such as marine organism segmentation and polyp segmentation, showcasing robust adaptability and significant application potential. The code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

The methodology involves extensive experimentation with data augmentation, dataset composition, and model scaling. While synthetic validation metrics were consistently high, they proved to be poor predictors of real-world performance. Consequently, models were also evaluated qualitatively, through visual inspection of predictions, and quantitatively, on a manually labeled real-world test set, to guide development. Final mAP@50 scores were provided by the official Kaggle competition. Key findings indicate that increasing synthetic dataset diversity, specifically by including varied perspectives and complex backgrounds, combined with carefully tuned data augmentation, were crucial in bridging the domain gap. The best performing configuration, a YOLOv11l model trained on an expanded and diverse dataset, achieved a final mAP@50 of 0.910 on the competition's hidden test set. This result demonstrates the potential of a synthetic-only training approach while also highlighting the remaining challenges in fully capturing real-world variability.</p></details> |  |

Detecting such interactions from images involves interpreting subtle visual cues such as relations, proximity, and co-movement - semantically complex signals that go beyond traditional object detection. To address this challenge, we introduce a social group region detection task, which requires inferring and spatially grounding visual regions defined by abstract interpersonal relations. We propose MINGLE (Modeling INterpersonal Group-Level Engagement), a modular three-stage pipeline that integrates: (1) off-the-shelf human detection and depth estimation, (2) VLM-based reasoning to classify pairwise social affiliation, and (3) a lightweight spatial aggregation algorithm to localize socially connected groups. To support this task and encourage future research, we present a new dataset of 100K urban street-view images annotated with bounding boxes and labels for both individuals and socially interacting groups. The annotations combine human-created labels and outputs from the MINGLE pipeline, ensuring semantic richness and broad coverage of real-world scenarios.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Fovea Stacking: Imaging with Dynamic Localized Aberration Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00716v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The desire for cameras with smaller form factors has recently lead to a push for exploring computational imaging systems with reduced optical complexity such as a smaller number of lens elements. Unfortunately such simplified optical systems usually suffer from severe aberrations, especially in off-axis regions, which can be difficult to correct purely in software. In this paper we introduce Fovea Stacking , a new type of imaging system that utilizes emerging dynamic optical components called deformable phase plates (DPPs) for localized aberration correction anywhere on the image sensor. By optimizing DPP deformations through a differentiable optical model, off-axis aberrations are corrected locally, producing a foveated image with enhanced sharpness at the fixation point - analogous to the eye's fovea. Stacking multiple such foveated images, each with a different fixation point, yields a composite image free from aberrations. To efficiently cover the entire field of view, we propose joint optimization of DPP deformations under imaging budget constraints. Due to the DPP device's non-linear behavior, we introduce a neural network-based control model for improved alignment between simulation-hardware performance. We further demonstrated that for extended depth-of-field imaging, fovea stacking outperforms traditional focus stacking in image quality. By integrating object detection or eye-tracking, the system can dynamically adjust the lens to track the object of interest-enabling real-time foveated video suitable for downstream applications such as surveillance or foveated virtual reality displays</p></details> |  |

However, our analysis indicates that under the full fine-tuning paradigm, the feature space becomes highly constrained and low-ranked, which has been proven to seriously impair generalization. One solution is freezing parameters to preserve pre-trained knowledge and thus maintain diversity of the feature space. To this end, we propose IV-tuning, to parameter-efficiently harness PVMs for various IR-VIS downstream tasks, including salient object detection, semantic segmentation, and object detection. Compared with the full fine-tuning baselines and existing IR-VIS methods, IV-tuning facilitates the learning of complementary information between infrared and visible modalities with less than 3% of the backbone parameters, and effectively alleviates the overfitting problem. The code is available in https://github.com/Yummy198913/IV-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Open-Vocabulary Part-Based Grasping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05951v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotic tasks require grasping objects at specific object parts instead of arbitrarily, a crucial capability for interactions beyond simple pick-and-place, such as human-robot interaction, handovers, or tool use. Prior work has focused either on generic grasp prediction or task-conditioned grasping, but not on directly targeting object parts in an open-vocabulary way. We propose AnyPart, a modular framework that unifies open-vocabulary object detection, part segmentation, and 6-DoF grasp prediction to enable robots to grasp user-specified parts of arbitrary objects based on natural language prompts. We evaluate 16 model combinations, and demonstrate that the best-performing combination achieves 60.8% grasp success in cluttered real-world scenes at 60 times faster inference than existing approaches. To support this study, we introduce a new dataset for part-based grasping and conduct a detailed failure analysis. Our core insight is that modularly combining existing foundation models unlocks surprisingly strong and efficient capabilities for open-vocabulary part-based grasping without requiring additional training.</p></details> |  |

Early and accurate detection is critical for minimizing economic losses and ensuring proper treatment. This study proposes a spatiotemporal deep learning framework for automated cattle lameness detection using publicly available video data. We curate and publicly release a balanced set of 50 online video clips featuring 42 individual cattle, recorded from multiple viewpoints in both indoor and outdoor environments. The videos were categorized into lame and non-lame classes based on visual gait characteristics and metadata descriptions. After applying data augmentation techniques to enhance generalization, two deep learning architectures were trained and evaluated: 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNN) and Convolutional Long-Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM2D). The 3D CNN achieved a video-level classification accuracy of 90%, with a precision, recall, and F1 score of 90.9% each, outperforming the ConvLSTM2D model, which achieved 85% accuracy. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on multistage pipelines involving object detection and pose estimation, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of a direct end-to-end video classification approach. Compared with the best end-to-end prior method (C3D-ConvLSTM, 90.3%), our model achieves comparable accuracy while eliminating pose estimation pre-processing.The results indicate that deep learning models can successfully extract and learn spatio-temporal features from various video sources, enabling scalable and efficient cattle lameness detection in real-world farm settings.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies have prioritized efficiency or accuracy enhancements, yet the issue of domain shift has been overlooked, leading to substantial performance degradation upon transfer. We identify major domain gaps in real-world cross-domain scenarios and initiate the first effort to address the Domain Adaptation (DA) challenge in multi-view 3D object detection for BEV perception. Given the complexity of BEV perception approaches with their multiple components, domain shift accumulation across multi-geometric spaces (e.g., 2D, 3D Voxel, BEV) poses a significant challenge for BEV domain adaptation. In this paper, we introduce an innovative geometric-aware teacher-student framework, BEVUDA++, to diminish this issue, comprising a Reliable Depth Teacher (RDT) and a Geometric Consistent Student (GCS) model. Specifically, RDT effectively blends target LiDAR with dependable depth predictions to generate depth-aware information based on uncertainty estimation, enhancing the extraction of Voxel and BEV features that are essential for understanding the target domain. To collaboratively reduce the domain shift, GCS maps features from multiple spaces into a unified geometric embedding space, thereby narrowing the gap in data distribution between the two domains. Additionally, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-guided Exponential Moving Average (UEMA) to further reduce error accumulation due to domain shifts informed by previously obtained uncertainty guidance. To demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we execute comprehensive experiments in four cross-domain scenarios, securing state-of-the-art performance in BEV 3D object detection tasks, e.g., 12.9\% NDS and 9.5\% mAP enhancement on Day-Night adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

Recent studies have shown that abstract images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Performance Optimization of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet for Robust Drone Detection in Visually Complex Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14012v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone detection in visually complex environments remains challenging due to background clutter, small object scale, and camouflage effects. While generic object detectors like YOLO exhibit strong performance in low-texture scenes, their effectiveness degrades in cluttered environments with low object-background separability. To address these limitations, this work presents an enhanced iteration of YOLO-FEDER FusionNet -- a detection framework that integrates generic object detection with camouflage object detection techniques. Building upon the original architecture, the proposed iteration introduces systematic advancements in training data composition, feature fusion strategies, and backbone design. Specifically, the training process leverages large-scale, photo-realistic synthetic data, complemented by a small set of real-world samples, to enhance robustness under visually complex conditions. The contribution of intermediate multi-scale FEDER features is systematically evaluated, and detection performance is comprehensively benchmarked across multiple YOLO-based backbone configurations. Empirical results indicate that integrating intermediate FEDER features, in combination with backbone upgrades, contributes to notable performance improvements. In the most promising configuration -- YOLO-FEDER FusionNet with a YOLOv8l backbone and FEDER features derived from the DWD module -- these enhancements lead to a FNR reduction of up to 39.1 percentage points and a mAP increase of up to 62.8 percentage points at an IoU threshold of 0.5, compared to the initial baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Novel Compression Framework for YOLOv8: Achieving Real-Time Aerial Object Detection on Edge Devices via Structured Pruning and Channel-Wise Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12918v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels, significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to 13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from 26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.</p></details> | 28 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Bridging the Synthetic-Real Gap: Supervised Domain Adaptation for Robust Spacecraft 6-DoF Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13792v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spacecraft Pose Estimation (SPE) is a fundamental capability for autonomous space operations such as rendezvous, docking, and in-orbit servicing. Hybrid pipelines that combine object detection, keypoint regression, and Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solvers have recently achieved strong results on synthetic datasets, yet their performance deteriorates sharply on real or lab-generated imagery due to the persistent synthetic-to-real domain gap. Existing unsupervised domain adaptation approaches aim to mitigate this issue but often underperform when a modest number of labeled target samples are available. In this work, we propose the first Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) framework tailored for SPE keypoint regression. Building on the Learning Invariant Representation and Risk (LIRR) paradigm, our method jointly optimizes domain-invariant representations and task-specific risk using both labeled synthetic and limited labeled real data, thereby reducing generalization error under domain shift. Extensive experiments on the SPEED+ benchmark demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms source-only, fine-tuning, and oracle baselines. Notably, with only 5% labeled target data, our method matches or surpasses oracle performance trained on larger fractions of labeled data. The framework is lightweight, backbone-agnostic, and computationally efficient, offering a practical pathway toward robust and deployable spacecraft pose estimation in real-world space environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Task-Aware Image Signal Processor for Advanced Visual Perception](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13762v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, there has been a growing trend in computer vision towards exploiting RAW sensor data, which preserves richer information compared to conventional low-bit RGB images. Early studies mainly focused on enhancing visual quality, while more recent efforts aim to leverage the abundant information in RAW data to improve the performance of visual perception tasks such as object detection and segmentation. However, existing approaches still face two key limitations: large-scale ISP networks impose heavy computational overhead, while methods based on tuning traditional ISP pipelines are restricted by limited representational capacity.To address these issues, we propose Task-Aware Image Signal Processing (TA-ISP), a compact RAW-to-RGB framework that produces task-oriented representations for pretrained vision models. Instead of heavy dense convolutional pipelines, TA-ISP predicts a small set of lightweight, multi-scale modulation operators that act at global, regional, and pixel scales to reshape image statistics across different spatial extents. This factorized control significantly expands the range of spatially varying transforms that can be represented while keeping memory usage, computation, and latency tightly constrained. Evaluated on several RAW-domain detection and segmentation benchmarks under both daytime and nighttime conditions, TA-ISP consistently improves downstream accuracy while markedly reducing parameter count and inference time, making it well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Aware: Adaptive Multi-Mode Out-of-Distribution Detection for Trajectory Prediction in Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13577v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trajectory prediction is central to the safe and seamless operation of autonomous vehicles (AVs). In deployment, however, prediction models inevitably face distribution shifts between training data and real-world conditions, where rare or underrepresented traffic scenarios induce out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. While most prior OOD detection research in AVs has concentrated on computer vision tasks such as object detection and segmentation, trajectory-level OOD detection remains largely underexplored. A recent study formulated this problem as a quickest change detection (QCD) task, providing formal guarantees on the trade-off between detection delay and false alarms [1]. Building on this foundation, we propose a new framework that introduces adaptive mechanisms to achieve robust detection in complex driving environments. Empirical analysis across multiple real-world datasets reveals that prediction errors -- even on in-distribution samples -- exhibit mode-dependent distributions that evolve over time with dataset-specific dynamics. By explicitly modeling these error modes, our method achieves substantial improvements in both detection delay and false alarm rates. Comprehensive experiments on established trajectory prediction benchmarks show that our framework significantly outperforms prior UQ- and vision-based OOD approaches in both accuracy and computational efficiency, offering a practical path toward reliable, driving-aware autonomy.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

We introduce a unified benchmark for end-to-end perception and grasp inference, evaluating a single VLM to perform tasks that traditionally require complex pipelines with separate modules for object detection, pose estimation, and grasp planning. To establish the feasibility and current limitations of this approach, we benchmark eight contemporary VLMs on their ability to perform a unified task essential for bionic grasping. From a single static image, they should (1) identify common objects and their key properties (name, shape, orientation, and dimensions), and (2) infer appropriate grasp parameters (grasp type, wrist rotation, hand aperture, and number of fingers). A corresponding prompt requesting a structured JSON output was employed with a dataset of 34 snapshots of common objects. Key performance metrics, including accuracy for categorical attributes (e.g., object name, shape) and errors in numerical estimates (e.g., dimensions, hand aperture), along with latency and cost, were analyzed. The results demonstrated that most models exhibited high performance in object identification and shape recognition, while accuracy in estimating dimensions and inferring optimal grasp parameters, particularly hand rotation and aperture, varied more significantly. This work highlights the current capabilities and limitations of VLMs as advanced perceptual modules for semi-autonomous control of bionic limbs, demonstrating their potential for effective prosthetic applications.</p></details> | ICAT 2025 |

Most existing image annotation software requires users to upload a precollected dataset, which limits support for on-demand pipelines and introduces unnecessary steps to acquire images. This constraint is particularly problematic in laboratory environments, where real-time data acquisition from instruments such as microscopes is increasingly common. In this work, we introduce \texttt{LivePixel}, a Python-based graphical user interface that integrates with imaging systems, such as webcams, microscopes, and others, to enable real-time image annotation. LivePyxel is designed to be easy to use through a simple interface that allows users to precisely delimit areas for annotation using tools commonly found in commercial graphics editing software. Of particular interest is the availability of B\'ezier splines and binary masks, and the software's capacity to work with non-destructive layers that enable high-performance editing. LivePyxel also integrates a wide compatibility across video devices, and it's optimized for object detection operations via the use of OpenCV in combination with high-performance libraries designed to handle matrix and linear algebra operations via Numpy effectively. LivePyxel facilitates seamless data collection and labeling, accelerating the development of AI models in experimental workflows.

| **[A Synthetic Data Pipeline for Supporting Manufacturing SMEs in Visual Assembly Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13089v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95) up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MSGFusion: Multimodal Scene Graph-Guided Infrared and Visible Image Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12901v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast, and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images. Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities, attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities, attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection, semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cumulative Consensus Score: Label-Free and Model-Agnostic Evaluation of Object Detectors in Deployment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12871v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations. In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90% congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the issue from the perspective of designing a solution leveraging digital image processing, deep learning, and artificial intelligence to improve the safety of pedestrians, drivers, cyclists, pets, and tram passengers. We present RailSafeNet, a real-time framework that fuses semantic segmentation, object detection and a rule-based Distance Assessor to highlight track intrusions. Using only monocular video, the system identifies rails, localises nearby objects and classifies their risk by comparing projected distances with the standard 1435mm rail gauge. Experiments on the diverse RailSem19 dataset show that a class-filtered SegFormer B3 model achieves 65% intersection-over-union (IoU), while a fine-tuned YOLOv8 attains 75.6% mean average precision (mAP) calculated at an intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.50. RailSafeNet therefore delivers accurate, annotation-light scene understanding that can warn drivers before dangerous situations escalate.

We further design Multi-Band Fourier Module(MBFM) to enhance the ability of the network in handling complex backgrounds and blurred boundaries. In addition, we design an Interactive Structure Enhancement Block (ISEB) to ensure structural integrity and boundary details in the predictions.

Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought (CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training. We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations, achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring manually annotated CoTs.Code and resources are available at: https://github.com/HSH55/RISE.</p></details> |  |

However, traditional manual observation methods are time-consuming, subjective, and limited in scalability. We present a modular pipeline that leverages open-sourced state-of-the-art computer vision techniques to automate animal behavior analysis in a group housing environment. Our approach combines state-of-the-art models for zero-shot object detection, motion-aware tracking and segmentation, and advanced feature extraction using vision transformers for robust behavior recognition. The pipeline addresses challenges including animal occlusions and group housing scenarios as demonstrated in indoor pig monitoring. We validated our system on the Edinburgh Pig Behavior Video Dataset for multiple behavioral tasks. Our temporal model achieved 94.2% overall accuracy, representing a 21.2 percentage point improvement over existing methods. The pipeline demonstrated robust tracking capabilities with 93.3% identity preservation score and 89.3% object detection precision. The modular design suggests potential for adaptation to other contexts, though further validation across species would be required. The open-source implementation provides a scalable solution for behavior monitoring, contributing to precision pig farming and welfare assessment through automated, objective, and continuous analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, Submitted to Computers and Electronics in Agriculture</p></details> |

While most existing SAM-based COD models primarily focus on enhancing SAM by extracting favorable features and amplifying its advantageous parameters, a crucial gap is identified: insufficient attention to adverse parameters that impair SAM's semantic understanding in downstream tasks. To tackle this issue, the Reverse SAM Parameter Configuration Module is proposed to effectively mitigate the influence of adverse parameters in a train-free manner by configuring SAM's parameters. Building on this foundation, the T-Visioner Module is unveiled to strengthen advantageous parameters by integrating Test-Time Training layers, originally developed for language tasks, into vision tasks. Test-Time Training layers represent a new class of sequence modeling layers characterized by linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. By integrating two modules, SAM-TTT simultaneously suppresses adverse parameters while reinforcing advantageous ones, significantly improving SAM's semantic understanding in COD task. Our experimental results on various COD benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, setting a new benchmark in the field.

This paper introduces an efficient end-to-end robotic system for autonomous shelf stocking and fronting, integrating commercially available hardware with a scalable algorithmic architecture. A major contribution of this work is the system integration of off-the-shelf hardware and ROS2-based perception, planning, and control into a single deployable platform for retail environments. Our solution leverages Behavior Trees (BTs) for task planning, fine-tuned vision models for object detection, and a two-step Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework for precise shelf navigation using ArUco markers. Laboratory experiments replicating realistic supermarket conditions demonstrate reliable performance, achieving over 98% success in pick-and-place operations across a total of more than 700 stocking events.

These methods require training on vast amounts of data usually with high-quality labels, which poses a bottleneck for most institutions that lack both large-scale data and high-end GPUs. On the other hand, many open-source vision models have been pretrained on domain-specific data, enabling them to distill and represent core knowledge in a form that is transferable across diverse applications. Even though these models are highly valuable assets, they remain largely under-explored in empowering the development of a general-purpose VFM. In this paper, we present a new model-driven approach for training VFMs through joint knowledge transfer and preservation. Our method unifies multiple pre-trained teacher models in a shared latent space to mitigate the ``imbalanced transfer'' issue caused by their distributional gaps. Besides, we introduce a knowledge preservation strategy to take a general-purpose teacher as a knowledge base for integrating knowledge from the remaining purpose-specific teachers using an adapter module. By unifying and aggregating existing models, we build a powerful VFM to inherit teachers' expertise without needing to train on a large amount of labeled data. Our model not only provides generalizable visual features, but also inherently supports multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our VFM outperforms existing data-centric models across four fundamental vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic and instance segmentation.</p></details> | Technical report |

Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM) offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance. However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and possible improvements. \textcolor{blue} {Code: https://github.com/Lwt-diamond/RAG-SEG.}</p></details> |  |
| **[IRDFusion: Iterative Relation-Map Difference guided Feature Fusion for Multispectral Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09085v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multispectral object detection methods often retain extraneous background or noise during feature fusion, limiting perceptual performance. To address this, we propose an innovative feature fusion framework based on cross-modal feature contrastive and screening strategy, diverging from conventional approaches. The proposed method adaptively enhances salient structures by fusing object-aware complementary cross-modal features while suppressing shared background interference. Our solution centers on two novel, specially designed modules: the Mutual Feature Refinement Module (MFRM) and the Differential Feature Feedback Module (DFFM). The MFRM enhances intra- and inter-modal feature representations by modeling their relationships, thereby improving cross-modal alignment and discriminative power. Inspired by feedback differential amplifiers, the DFFM dynamically computes inter-modal differential features as guidance signals and feeds them back to the MFRM, enabling adaptive fusion of complementary information while suppressing common-mode noise across modalities. To enable robust feature learning, the MFRM and DFFM are integrated into a unified framework, which is formally formulated as an Iterative Relation-Map Differential Guided Feature Fusion mechanism, termed IRDFusion. IRDFusion enables high-quality cross-modal fusion by progressively amplifying salient relational signals through iterative feedback, while suppressing feature noise, leading to significant performance gains. In extensive experiments on FLIR, LLVIP and M$^3$FD datasets, IRDFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance and consistently outperforms existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.

In this paper, we propose FusionNet, a novel end-to-end fusion framework that explicitly models inter-modality interaction and enhances task-critical regions. FusionNet introduces a modality-aware attention mechanism that dynamically adjusts the contribution of infrared and visible features based on their discriminative capacity. To achieve fine-grained, interpretable fusion, we further incorporate a pixel-wise alpha blending module, which learns spatially-varying fusion weights in an adaptive and content-aware manner. Moreover, we formulate a target-aware loss that leverages weak ROI supervision to preserve semantic consistency in regions containing important objects (e.g., pedestrians, vehicles). Experiments on the public M3FD dataset demonstrate that FusionNet generates fused images with enhanced semantic preservation, high perceptual quality, and clear interpretability. Our framework provides a general and extensible solution for semantic-aware multi-modal image fusion, with benefits for downstream tasks such as object detection and scene understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2025 6th International Conference on Computer Vision and Data Mining (ICCVDM 2025)</p></details> |

| **[Object Tracking Incorporating Transfer Learning into Unscented and Cubature Kalman Filters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07157v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel filtering algorithm that employs Bayesian transfer learning to address the challenges posed by mismatched intensity of the noise in a pair of sensors, each of which tracks an object using a nonlinear dynamic system model. In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[MATTER: Multiscale Attention for Registration Error Regression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12924v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Mean of Multi-Object Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20391v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the concept of a mean for trajectories and multi-object trajectories (defined as sets or multi-sets of trajectories) along with algorithms for computing them. Specifically, we use the Fr\'{e}chet mean, and metrics based on the optimal sub-pattern assignment (OSPA) construct, to extend the notion of average from vectors to trajectories and multi-object trajectories. Further, we develop efficient algorithms to compute these means using greedy search and Gibbs sampling. Using distributed multi-object tracking as an application, we demonstrate that the Fr\'{e}chet mean approach to multi-object trajectory consensus significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distributed multi-object tracking methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[StableTracker: Learning to Stably Track Target via Differentiable Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14147v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>FPV object tracking methods heavily rely on handcraft modular designs, resulting in hardware overload and cumulative error, which seriously degrades the tracking performance, especially for rapidly accelerating or decelerating targets. To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy, stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[VSE-MOT: Multi-Object Tracking in Low-Quality Video Scenes Guided by Visual Semantic Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14060v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current multi-object tracking (MOT) algorithms typically overlook issues inherent in low-quality videos, leading to significant degradation in tracking performance when confronted with real-world image deterioration. Therefore, advancing the application of MOT algorithms in real-world low-quality video scenarios represents a critical and meaningful endeavor. To address the challenges posed by low-quality scenarios, inspired by vision-language models, this paper proposes a Visual Semantic Enhancement-guided Multi-Object Tracking framework (VSE-MOT). Specifically, we first design a tri-branch architecture that leverages a vision-language model to extract global visual semantic information from images and fuse it with query vectors. Subsequently, to further enhance the utilization of visual semantic information, we introduce the Multi-Object Tracking Adapter (MOT-Adapter) and the Visual Semantic Fusion Module (VSFM). The MOT-Adapter adapts the extracted global visual semantic information to suit multi-object tracking tasks, while the VSFM improves the efficacy of feature fusion. Through extensive experiments, we validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in real-world low-quality video scenarios. Its tracking performance metrics outperform those of existing methods by approximately 8% to 20%, while maintaining robust performance in conventional scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distractor-Aware Memory-Based Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13864v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent emergence of memory-based video segmentation methods such as SAM2 has led to models with excellent performance in segmentation tasks, achieving leading results on numerous benchmarks. However, these modes are not fully adjusted for visual object tracking, where distractors (i.e., objects visually similar to the target) pose a key challenge. In this paper we propose a distractor-aware drop-in memory module and introspection-based management method for SAM2, leading to DAM4SAM. Our design effectively reduces the tracking drift toward distractors and improves redetection capability after object occlusion. To facilitate the analysis of tracking in the presence of distractors, we construct DiDi, a Distractor-Distilled dataset. DAM4SAM outperforms SAM2.1 on thirteen benchmarks and sets new state-of-the-art results on ten. Furthermore, integrating the proposed distractor-aware memory into a real-time tracker EfficientTAM leads to 11% improvement and matches tracking quality of the non-real-time SAM2.1-L on multiple tracking and segmentation benchmarks, while integration with edge-based tracker EdgeTAM delivers 4% performance boost, demonstrating a very good generalization across architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on Github: https://github.com/jovanavidenovic/DAM4SAM</p></details> |

The framework integrates: (1) a YOLOv7 segmentation model for fast and robust object localization, (2) a ConvNeXt-based feature extractor trained with triplet loss to generate discriminative embeddings, and (3) a feature-assisted IoU tracker that ensures resilient multi-object tracking under occlusion and motion. To enable scalable field deployment, the pipeline is optimized for deployment on low-cost edge hardware using mixed-precision inference. The system supports incremental updates by adding embeddings from previously unseen objects into a reference database without requiring model retraining. Extensive experiments on real-world surveillance and drone video datasets demonstrate the framework's high accuracy and robustness across diverse FOI scenarios. In addition, hardware benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson devices confirm the framework's practicality and scalability for real-world edge applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 page Journal paper, accepted by IEEE Open Access Journal of Power and Energy</p></details> |
| **[T-SiamTPN: Temporal Siamese Transformer Pyramid Networks for Robust and Efficient UAV Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12913v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations, dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies, resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion. Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions, strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations. These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1 FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains: compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and efficient solution for aerial object tracking.

| **[Multi-animal tracking in Transition: Comparative Insights into Established and Emerging Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11873v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Precision livestock farming requires advanced monitoring tools to meet the increasing management needs of the industry. Computer vision systems capable of long-term multi-animal tracking (MAT) are essential for continuous behavioral monitoring in livestock production. MAT, a specialized subset of multi-object tracking (MOT), shares many challenges with MOT, but also faces domain-specific issues including frequent animal occlusion, highly similar appearances among animals, erratic motion patterns, and a wide range of behavior types. While some existing MAT tools are user-friendly and widely adopted, they often underperform compared to state-of-the-art MOT methods, which can result in inaccurate downstream tasks such as behavior analysis, health state estimation, and related applications. In this study, we benchmarked both MAT and MOT approaches for long-term tracking of pigs. We compared tools such as DeepLabCut and idTracker with MOT-based methods including ByteTrack, DeepSORT, cross-input consistency, and newer approaches like Track-Anything and PromptTrack. All methods were evaluated on a 10-minute pig tracking dataset. Our results demonstrate that, overall, MOT approaches outperform traditional MAT tools, even for long-term tracking scenarios. These findings highlight the potential of recent MOT techniques to enhance the accuracy and reliability of automated livestock tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Seg2Track-SAM2: SAM2-based Multi-object Tracking and Segmentation for Zero-shot Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11772v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous systems require robust Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) capabilities to operate reliably in dynamic environments. MOT ensures consistent object identity assignment and precise spatial delineation. Recent advances in foundation models, such as SAM2, have demonstrated strong zero-shot generalization for video segmentation, but their direct application to MOTS (MOT+Segmentation) remains limited by insufficient identity management and memory efficiency. This work introduces Seg2Track-SAM2, a framework that integrates pre-trained object detectors with SAM2 and a novel Seg2Track module to address track initialization, track management, and reinforcement. The proposed approach requires no fine-tuning and remains detector-agnostic. Experimental results on KITTI MOT and KITTI MOTS benchmarks show that Seg2Track-SAM2 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, ranking fourth overall in both car and pedestrian classes on KITTI MOTS, while establishing a new benchmark in association accuracy (AssA). Furthermore, a sliding-window memory strategy reduces memory usage by up to 75% with negligible performance degradation, supporting deployment under resource constraints. These results confirm that Seg2Track-SAM2 advances MOTS by combining robust zero-shot tracking, enhanced identity preservation, and efficient memory utilization.

| **[Beyond Frame-wise Tracking: A Trajectory-based Paradigm for Efficient Point Cloud Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11453v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LiDAR-based 3D single object tracking (3D SOT) is a critical task in robotics and autonomous systems. Existing methods typically follow frame-wise motion estimation or a sequence-based paradigm. However, the two-frame methods are efficient but lack long-term temporal context, making them vulnerable in sparse or occluded scenes, while sequence-based methods that process multiple point clouds gain robustness at a significant computational cost. To resolve this dilemma, we propose a novel trajectory-based paradigm and its instantiation, TrajTrack. TrajTrack is a lightweight framework that enhances a base two-frame tracker by implicitly learning motion continuity from historical bounding box trajectories alone-without requiring additional, costly point cloud inputs. It first generates a fast, explicit motion proposal and then uses an implicit motion modeling module to predict the future trajectory, which in turn refines and corrects the initial proposal. Extensive experiments on the large-scale NuScenes benchmark show that TrajTrack achieves new state-of-the-art performance, dramatically improving tracking precision by 4.48% over a strong baseline while running at 56 FPS. Besides, we also demonstrate the strong generalizability of TrajTrack across different base trackers.

| **[Motion Estimation for Multi-Object Tracking using KalmanNet with Semantic-Independent Encoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11323v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motion estimation is a crucial component in multi-object tracking (MOT). It predicts the trajectory of objects by analyzing the changes in their positions in consecutive frames of images, reducing tracking failures and identity switches. The Kalman filter (KF) based on the linear constant-velocity model is one of the most commonly used methods in MOT. However, it may yield unsatisfactory results when KF's parameters are mismatched and objects move in non-stationary. In this work, we utilize the learning-aided filter to handle the motion estimation of MOT. In particular, we propose a novel method named Semantic-Independent KalmanNet (SIKNet), which encodes the state vector (the input feature) using a Semantic-Independent Encoder (SIE) by two steps. First, the SIE uses a 1D convolution with a kernel size of 1, which convolves along the dimension of homogeneous-semantic elements across different state vectors to encode independent semantic information. Then it employs a fully-connected layer and a nonlinear activation layer to encode nonlinear and cross-dependency information between heterogeneous-semantic elements. To independently evaluate the performance of the motion estimation module in MOT, we constructed a large-scale semi-simulated dataset from several open-source MOT datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed SIKNet outperforms the traditional KF and achieves superior robustness and accuracy than existing learning-aided filters. The code is available at (https://github.com/SongJgit/filternet and https://github.com/SongJgit/TBDTracker).</p></details> |  |
| **[ISTASTrack: Bridging ANN and SNN via ISTA Adapter for RGB-Event Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09977v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>RGB-Event tracking has become a promising trend in visual object tracking to leverage the complementary strengths of both RGB images and dynamic spike events for improved performance. However, existing artificial neural networks (ANNs) struggle to fully exploit the sparse and asynchronous nature of event streams. Recent efforts toward hybrid architectures combining ANNs and spiking neural networks (SNNs) have emerged as a promising solution in RGB-Event perception, yet effectively fusing features across heterogeneous paradigms remains a challenge. In this work, we propose ISTASTrack, the first transformer-based \textbf{A}NN-\textbf{S}NN hybrid \textbf{Track}er equipped with \textbf{ISTA} adapters for RGB-Event tracking. The two-branch model employs a vision transformer to extract spatial context from RGB inputs and a spiking transformer to capture spatio-temporal dynamics from event streams. To bridge the modality and paradigm gap between ANN and SNN features, we systematically design a model-based ISTA adapter for bidirectional feature interaction between the two branches, derived from sparse representation theory by unfolding the iterative shrinkage thresholding algorithm. Additionally, we incorporate a temporal downsampling attention module within the adapter to align multi-step SNN features with single-step ANN features in the latent space, improving temporal fusion. Experimental results on RGB-Event tracking benchmarks, such as FE240hz, VisEvent, COESOT, and FELT, have demonstrated that ISTASTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high energy efficiency, highlighting the effectiveness and practicality of hybrid ANN-SNN designs for robust visual tracking.

| **[An HMM-based framework for identity-aware long-term multi-object tracking from sparse and uncertain identification: use case on long-term tracking in livestock](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09962v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The need for long-term multi-object tracking (MOT) is growing due to the demand for analyzing individual behaviors in videos that span several minutes. Unfortunately, due to identity switches between objects, the tracking performance of existing MOT approaches decreases over time, making them difficult to apply for long-term tracking. However, in many real-world applications, such as in the livestock sector, it is possible to obtain sporadic identifications for some of the animals from sources like feeders. To address the challenges of long-term MOT, we propose a new framework that combines both uncertain identities and tracking using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) formulation. In addition to providing real-world identities to animals, our HMM framework improves the F1 score of ByteTrack, a leading MOT approach even with re-identification, on a 10 minute pig tracking dataset with 21 identifications at the pen's feeding station. We also show that our approach is robust to the uncertainty of identifications, with performance increasing as identities are provided more frequently. The improved performance of our HMM framework was also validated on the MOT17 and MOT20 benchmark datasets using both ByteTrack and FairMOT. The code for this new HMM framework and the new 10-minute pig tracking video dataset are available at: https://github.com/ngobibibnbe/uncertain-identity-aware-tracking</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 7 figures, 1 table, accepted at CVPR animal workshop 2024, submitted to IJCV</p></details> |
| **[Classification of Driver Behaviour Using External Observation Techniques for Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09349v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Road traffic accidents remain a significant global concern, with human error, particularly distracted and impaired driving, among the leading causes. This study introduces a novel driver behavior classification system that uses external observation techniques to detect indicators of distraction and impairment. The proposed framework employs advanced computer vision methodologies, including real-time object tracking, lateral displacement analysis, and lane position monitoring. The system identifies unsafe driving behaviors such as excessive lateral movement and erratic trajectory patterns by implementing the YOLO object detection model and custom lane estimation algorithms. Unlike systems reliant on inter-vehicular communication, this vision-based approach enables behavioral analysis of non-connected vehicles. Experimental evaluations on diverse video datasets demonstrate the framework's reliability and adaptability across varying road and environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[V-HOP: Visuo-Haptic 6D Object Pose Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17434v2)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans naturally integrate vision and haptics for robust object perception during manipulation. The loss of either modality significantly degrades performance. Inspired by this multisensory integration, prior object pose estimation research has attempted to combine visual and haptic/tactile feedback. Although these works demonstrate improvements in controlled environments or synthetic datasets, they often underperform vision-only approaches in real-world settings due to poor generalization across diverse grippers, sensor layouts, or sim-to-real environments. Furthermore, they typically estimate the object pose for each frame independently, resulting in less coherent tracking over sequences in real-world deployments. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel unified haptic representation that effectively handles multiple gripper embodiments. Building on this representation, we introduce a new visuo-haptic transformer-based object pose tracker that seamlessly integrates visual and haptic input. We validate our framework in our dataset and the Feelsight dataset, demonstrating significant performance improvement on challenging sequences. Notably, our method achieves superior generalization and robustness across novel embodiments, objects, and sensor types (both taxel-based and vision-based tactile sensors). In real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art visual trackers by a large margin. We further show that we can achieve precise manipulation tasks by incorporating our real-time object tracking result into motion plans, underscoring the advantages of visuo-haptic perception.

| **[Sparse BEV Fusion with Self-View Consistency for Multi-View Detection and Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08421v1)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-View Multi-Object Tracking (MVMOT) is essential for applications such as surveillance, autonomous driving, and sports analytics. However, maintaining consistent object identities across multiple cameras remains challenging due to viewpoint changes, lighting variations, and occlusions, which often lead to tracking errors.Recent methods project features from multiple cameras into a unified Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) space to improve robustness against occlusion. However, this projection introduces feature distortion and non-uniform density caused by variations in object scale with distance. These issues degrade the quality of the fused representation and reduce detection and tracking accuracy.To address these problems, we propose SCFusion, a framework that combines three techniques to improve multi-view feature integration. First, it applies a sparse transformation to avoid unnatural interpolation during projection. Next, it performs density-aware weighting to adaptively fuse features based on spatial confidence and camera distance. Finally, it introduces a multi-view consistency loss that encourages each camera to learn discriminative features independently before fusion.Experiments show that SCFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an IDF1 score of 95.9% on WildTrack and a MODP of 89.2% on MultiviewX, outperforming the baseline method TrackTacular. These results demonstrate that SCFusion effectively mitigates the limitations of conventional BEV projection and provides a robust and accurate solution for multi-view object detection and tracking.</p></details> |  |

This shift imposes new demands on mobile sensing, particularly in achieving high-accuracy and low-latency. Event-based vision has emerged as a disruptive paradigm, offering high temporal resolution and low latency, making it well-suited for high-accuracy and low-latency sensing tasks on high-agility platforms. However, the presence of substantial noisy events, lack of stable, persistent semantic information, and large data volume pose challenges for event-based data processing on resource-constrained mobile devices. This paper surveys the literature from 2014 to 2025 and presents a comprehensive overview of event-based mobile sensing, encompassing its fundamental principles, event \textit{abstraction} methods, \textit{algorithm} advancements, and both hardware and software \textit{acceleration} strategies. We discuss key \textit{applications} of event cameras in mobile sensing, including visual odometry, object tracking, optical flow, and 3D reconstruction, while highlighting challenges associated with event data processing, sensor fusion, and real-time deployment. Furthermore, we outline future research directions, such as improving the event camera with advanced optics, leveraging neuromorphic computing for efficient processing, and integrating bio-inspired algorithms. To support ongoing research, we provide an open-source \textit{Online Sheet} with recent developments.

While existing hyperspectral trackers have made progress by either transforming hyperspectral data into false-color images or incorporating modality fusion strategies, they often fail to capture the intrinsic spectral information, temporal dependencies, and cross-depth interactions. To address these limitations, a new hyperspectral object tracking network equipped with Mamba (HyMamba), is proposed. It unifies spectral, cross-depth, and temporal modeling through state space modules (SSMs). The core of HyMamba lies in the Spectral State Integration (SSI) module, which enables progressive refinement and propagation of spectral features with cross-depth and temporal spectral information. Embedded within each SSI, the Hyperspectral Mamba (HSM) module is introduced to learn spatial and spectral information synchronously via three directional scanning SSMs. Based on SSI and HSM, HyMamba constructs joint features from false-color and hyperspectral inputs, and enhances them through interaction with original spectral features extracted from raw hyperspectral images. Extensive experiments conducted on seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that HyMamba achieves state-of-the-art performance. For instance, it achieves 73.0\% of the AUC score and 96.3\% of the DP@20 score on the HOTC2020 dataset. The code will be released at https://github.com/lgao001/HyMamba.</p></details> |  |

Finally we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines aiming to process FMO datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Depthwise-Dilated Convolutional Adapters for Medical Object Tracking and Segmentation Using the Segment Anything Model 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14613v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in medical image segmentation have been driven by deep learning; however, most existing methods remain limited by modality-specific designs and exhibit poor adaptability to dynamic medical imaging scenarios. The Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) and its related variants, which introduce a streaming memory mechanism for real-time video segmentation, present new opportunities for prompt-based, generalizable solutions. Nevertheless, adapting these models to medical video scenarios typically requires large-scale datasets for retraining or transfer learning, leading to high computational costs and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we propose DD-SAM2, an efficient adaptation framework for SAM2 that incorporates a Depthwise-Dilated Adapter (DD-Adapter) to enhance multi-scale feature extraction with minimal parameter overhead. This design enables effective fine-tuning of SAM2 on medical videos with limited training data. Unlike existing adapter-based methods focused solely on static images, DD-SAM2 fully exploits SAM2's streaming memory for medical video object tracking and segmentation. Comprehensive evaluations on TrackRad2025 (tumor segmentation) and EchoNet-Dynamic (left ventricle tracking) datasets demonstrate superior performance, achieving Dice scores of 0.93 and 0.97, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides an initial attempt at systematically exploring adapter-based SAM2 fine-tuning for medical video segmentation and tracking. Code, datasets, and models will be publicly available at https://github.com/apple1986/DD-SAM2.</p></details> | 24 pages, 6 figures |

We formulate a variational inference problem to approximate the posterior density of the state conditioned on the measurement data. We view the unknown data association as a latent variable and apply Expectation Maximization (EM) to obtain a filter with update step in the same form as the Kalman filter but with expanded measurement vector of all potential associations. We show that the association probabilities can be computed as permanents of matrices with measurement likelihood entries. We also propose an ambiguity check that associates only a subset of ambiguous measurements and states probabilistically, thus reducing the association time and preventing low-probability measurements from harming the estimation accuracy. Experiments in simulation show that our filter achieves lower tracking errors than the well-established joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), while running at comparable rate. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of our filter in multi-object tracking (MOT) on multiple real-world datasets, including MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack. We achieve better higher order tracking accuracy (HOTA) than previous Kalman-filter methods and remain real-time. Associating only bounding boxes without deep features or velocities, our method ranks top-10 on both MOT17 and MOT20 in terms of HOTA. Given offline detections, our algorithm tracks at 250+ fps on a single laptop CPU. Code is available at https://github.com/hwcao17/pkf.</p></details> |  |

In this study, a novel benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers. The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 3 figures, dataset available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/MBARI-org/DeepSea-MOT</p></details> |

Fully-supervised learning methods are known to achieve excellent tracking performances, but acquiring identity-level annotations is tedious and time-consuming. Motivated by the fact that in real-world scenarios object motion can be usually represented by a Markov process, we present a novel expectation maximization (EM) algorithm that trains a neural network to associate detections for tracking, without requiring prior knowledge of their temporal correspondences. At the core of our method lies a neural Kalman filter, with an observation model conditioned on associations of detections parameterized by a neural network. Given a batch of frames as input, data associations between detections from adjacent frames are predicted by a neural network followed by a Sinkhorn normalization that determines the assignment probabilities of detections to states. Kalman smoothing is then used to obtain the marginal probability of observations given the inferred states, producing a training objective to maximize this marginal probability using gradient descent. The proposed framework is fully differentiable, allowing the underlying neural model to be trained end-to-end. We evaluate our approach on the challenging MOT17, MOT20, and BDD100K datasets and achieve state-of-the-art results in comparison to self-supervised trackers using public detections.</p></details> | BMVC2025 poster |
| **[See No Evil: Adversarial Attacks Against Linguistic-Visual Association in Referring Multi-Object Tracking Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02028v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language-vision understanding has driven the development of advanced perception systems, most notably the emerging paradigm of Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT). By leveraging natural-language queries, RMOT systems can selectively track objects that satisfy a given semantic description, guided through Transformer-based spatial-temporal reasoning modules. End-to-End (E2E) RMOT models further unify feature extraction, temporal memory, and spatial reasoning within a Transformer backbone, enabling long-range spatial-temporal modeling over fused textual-visual representations. Despite these advances, the reliability and robustness of RMOT remain underexplored. In this paper, we examine the security implications of RMOT systems from a design-logic perspective, identifying adversarial vulnerabilities that compromise both the linguistic-visual referring and track-object matching components. Additionally, we uncover a novel vulnerability in advanced RMOT models employing FIFO-based memory, whereby targeted and consistent attacks on their spatial-temporal reasoning introduce errors that persist within the history buffer over multiple subsequent frames. We present VEIL, a novel adversarial framework designed to disrupt the unified referring-matching mechanisms of RMOT models. We show that carefully crafted digital and physical perturbations can corrupt the tracking logic reliability, inducing track ID switches and terminations. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using the Refer-KITTI dataset to validate the effectiveness of VEIL and demonstrate the urgent need for security-aware RMOT designs for critical large-scale applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 1 figure, 3 tables</p></details> |

The aim of this dataset is to mimic the intricate challenges encountered in real-world environments such as images captured by hand-held cameras, self-driving cars, etc. The current benchmarks for TTA focus on how models face distribution shifts, when deployed, and on violations to the customary independent-and-identically-distributed (i.i.d.) assumption in machine learning. Yet, these benchmarks fail to faithfully represent realistic scenarios that naturally display temporal dependencies, such as how consecutive frames from a video stream likely show the same object across time. We address this shortcoming of current datasets by proposing a novel TTA benchmark we call the "Inherent Temporal Dependencies" (ITD) dataset. We ensure the instances in ITD naturally embody temporal dependencies by collecting them from tracklets-sequences of object-centric images we compile from the bounding boxes of an object-tracking dataset. We use ITD to conduct a thorough experimental analysis of current TTA methods, and shed light on the limitations of these methods when faced with the challenges of temporal dependencies. Moreover, we build upon these insights and propose a novel adversarial memory initialization strategy to improve memory-based TTA methods. We find this strategy substantially boosts the performance of various methods on our challenging benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Current \textit{online} trackers rely on frame-by-frame hand-crafted association strategies and struggle with long-term occlusions, whereas \textit{offline} approaches can cover larger time gaps, but still rely on heuristic stitching for arbitrarily long sequences. In this paper, we introduce NOOUGAT, the first tracker designed to operate with arbitrary temporal horizons. NOOUGAT leverages a unified Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework that processes non-overlapping subclips, and fuses them through a novel Autoregressive Long-term Tracking (ALT) layer. The subclip size controls the trade-off between latency and temporal context, enabling a wide range of deployment scenarios, from frame-by-frame to batch processing. NOOUGAT achieves state-of-the-art performance across both tracking regimes, improving \textit{online} AssA by +2.3 on DanceTrack, +9.2 on SportsMOT, and +5.0 on MOT20, with even greater gains in \textit{offline} mode.</p></details> |  |

As a generative paradigm originally designed for natural language, autoregressive models face similar challenges. In this work, we present the first systematic investigation into the mechanisms of applying the next-token prediction paradigm to the visual domain. We identify three key properties that hinder the learning of high-level visual semantics: local and conditional dependence, inter-step semantic inconsistency, and spatial invariance deficiency. We show that these issues can be effectively addressed by introducing self-supervised objectives during training, leading to a novel training framework, Self-guided Training for AutoRegressive models (ST-AR). Without relying on pre-trained representation models, ST-AR significantly enhances the image understanding ability of autoregressive models and leads to improved generation quality. Specifically, ST-AR brings approximately 42% FID improvement for LlamaGen-L and 49% FID improvement for LlamaGen-XL, while maintaining the same sampling strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Despite their remarkable advancements, diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically, End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes an AI-driven agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model (VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility, clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable and energy-efficient deployment, future iterations will incorporate a green CNN architecture enhanced with FPGA-based incremental learning, enabling real-time inference on edge platforms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ICCVW 2025</p></details> |

Although many approaches focus on scenes primarily affected by discoloration, they often overlook the model's ability to capture the complex, distance-dependent visibility loss present in highly turbid environments. In this work, we propose an improved synthetic data generation pipeline that includes the commonly omitted forward scattering term, while also considering a nonuniform medium. Additionally, we collected the BUCKET dataset under controlled turbidity conditions to acquire real turbid footage with the corresponding reference images. Our results demonstrate qualitative improvements over the reference model, particularly under increasing turbidity, with a selection rate of 82. 5\% by survey participants.

| **[NeRF-based Visualization of 3D Cues Supporting Data-Driven Spacecraft Pose Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14890v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>On-orbit operations require the estimation of the relative 6D pose, i.e., position and orientation, between a chaser spacecraft and its target. While data-driven spacecraft pose estimation methods have been developed, their adoption in real missions is hampered by the lack of understanding of their decision process. This paper presents a method to visualize the 3D visual cues on which a given pose estimator relies. For this purpose, we train a NeRF-based image generator using the gradients back-propagated through the pose estimation network. This enforces the generator to render the main 3D features exploited by the spacecraft pose estimation network. Experiments demonstrate that our method recovers the relevant 3D cues. Furthermore, they offer additional insights on the relationship between the pose estimation network supervision and its implicit representation of the target spacecraft.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review (8 pages, 2 figures)</p></details> |
| **[PVLM: Parsing-Aware Vision Language Model with Dynamic Contrastive Learning for Zero-Shot Deepfake Attribution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14129v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The challenge of tracing the source attribution of forged faces has gained significant attention due to the rapid advancement of generative models. However, existing deepfake attribution (DFA) works primarily focus on the interaction among various domains in vision modality, and other modalities such as texts and face parsing are not fully explored. Besides, they tend to fail to assess the generalization performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion in a fine-grained manner. In this paper, we propose a novel parsing-aware vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning(PVLM) method for zero-shot deepfake attribution (ZS-DFA),which facilitates effective and fine-grained traceability to unseen advanced generators. Specifically, we conduct a novel and fine-grained ZS-DFA benchmark to evaluate the attribution performance of deepfake attributors to unseen advanced generators like diffusion. Besides, we propose an innovative parsing-guided vision language model with dynamic contrastive learning (PVLM) method to capture general and diverse attribution features. We are motivated by the observation that the preservation of source face attributes in facial images generated by GAN and diffusion models varies significantly. We employ the inherent face attributes preservation differences to capture face parsing-aware forgery representations. Therefore, we devise a novel parsing encoder to focus on global face attribute embeddings, enabling parsing-guided DFA representation learning via dynamic vision-parsing matching. Additionally, we present a novel deepfake attribution contrastive center loss to pull relevant generators closer and push irrelevant ones away, which can be introduced into DFA models to enhance traceability. Experimental results show that our model exceeds the state-of-the-art on the ZS-DFA benchmark via various protocol evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mutual Information Perspective on Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models for Positive View Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13718v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In image generation, Multiple Latent Variable Generative Models (MLVGMs) employ multiple latent variables to gradually shape the final images, from global characteristics to finer and local details (e.g., StyleGAN, NVAE), emerging as powerful tools for diverse applications. Yet their generative dynamics remain only empirically observed, without a systematic understanding of each latent variable's impact. In this work, we propose a novel framework that quantifies the contribution of each latent variable using Mutual Information (MI) as a metric. Our analysis reveals that current MLVGMs often underutilize some latent variables, and provides actionable insights for their use in downstream applications. With this foundation, we introduce a method for generating synthetic data for Self-Supervised Contrastive Representation Learning (SSCRL). By leveraging the hierarchical and disentangled variables of MLVGMs, our approach produces diverse and semantically meaningful views without the need for real image data. Additionally, we introduce a Continuous Sampling (CS) strategy, where the generator dynamically creates new samples during SSCRL training, greatly increasing data variability. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these contributions, showing that MLVGMs' generated views compete on par with or even surpass views generated from real data. This work establishes a principled approach to understanding and exploiting MLVGMs, advancing both generative modeling and self-supervised learning.

| **[TIDE: Achieving Balanced Subject-Driven Image Generation via Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06499v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework, which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image, instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance, outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation, and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at https://github.com/KomJay520/TIDE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Event-LAB: Towards Standardized Evaluation of Neuromorphic Localization Methods](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14516v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Event-based localization research and datasets are a rapidly growing area of interest, with a tenfold increase in the cumulative total number of published papers on this topic over the past 10 years. Whilst the rapid expansion in the field is exciting, it brings with it an associated challenge: a growth in the variety of required code and package dependencies as well as data formats, making comparisons difficult and cumbersome for researchers to implement reliably. To address this challenge, we present Event-LAB: a new and unified framework for running several event-based localization methodologies across multiple datasets. Event-LAB is implemented using the Pixi package and dependency manager, that enables a single command-line installation and invocation for combinations of localization methods and datasets. To demonstrate the capabilities of the framework, we implement two common event-based localization pipelines: Visual Place Recognition (VPR) and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). We demonstrate the ability of the framework to systematically visualize and analyze the results of multiple methods and datasets, revealing key insights such as the association of parameters that control event collection counts and window sizes for frame generation to large variations in performance. The results and analysis demonstrate the importance of fairly comparing methodologies with consistent event image generation parameters. Our Event-LAB framework provides this ability for the research community, by contributing a streamlined workflow for easily setting up multiple conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 6 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[AToken: A Unified Tokenizer for Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14476v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present AToken, the first unified visual tokenizer that achieves both high-fidelity reconstruction and semantic understanding across images, videos, and 3D assets. Unlike existing tokenizers that specialize in either reconstruction or understanding for single modalities, AToken encodes these diverse visual inputs into a shared 4D latent space, unifying both tasks and modalities in a single framework. Specifically, we introduce a pure transformer architecture with 4D rotary position embeddings to process visual inputs of arbitrary resolutions and temporal durations. To ensure stable training, we introduce an adversarial-free training objective that combines perceptual and Gram matrix losses, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality. By employing a progressive training curriculum, AToken gradually expands from single images, videos, and 3D, and supports both continuous and discrete latent tokens. AToken achieves 0.21 rFID with 82.2% ImageNet accuracy for images, 3.01 rFVD with 32.6% MSRVTT retrieval for videos, and 28.19 PSNR with 90.9% classification accuracy for 3D. In downstream applications, AToken enables both visual generation tasks (e.g., image generation with continuous and discrete tokens, text-to-video generation, image-to-3D synthesis) and understanding tasks (e.g., multimodal LLMs), achieving competitive performance across all benchmarks. These results shed light on the next-generation multimodal AI systems built upon unified visual tokenization.</p></details> | 30 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Reconstruction Alignment Improves Unified Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07295v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours, post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit 6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 24 figures and 10 tables; Update related work and fix typos</p></details> |

Existing exam-style benchmarks mainly focus on understanding and reasoning tasks, and current generation benchmarks emphasize the illustration of world knowledge and visual concepts, neglecting the evaluation of rigorous drawing exams. We introduce GenExam, the first benchmark for multidisciplinary text-to-image exams, featuring 1,000 samples across 10 subjects with exam-style prompts organized under a four-level taxonomy. Each problem is equipped with ground-truth images and fine-grained scoring points to enable a precise evaluation of semantic correctness and visual plausibility. Experiments show that even state-of-the-art models such as GPT-Image-1 and Gemini-2.5-Flash-Image achieve less than 15% strict scores, and most models yield almost 0%, suggesting the great challenge of our benchmark. By framing image generation as an exam, GenExam offers a rigorous assessment of models' ability to integrate knowledge, reasoning, and generation, providing insights on the path to general AGI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uni-cot: Towards Unified Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Across Text and Vision](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05606v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning has been widely adopted to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) by decomposing complex tasks into simpler, sequential subtasks. However, extending CoT to vision-language reasoning tasks remains challenging, as it often requires interpreting transitions of visual states to support reasoning. Existing methods often struggle with this due to limited capacity of modeling visual state transitions or incoherent visual trajectories caused by fragmented architectures. To overcome these limitations, we propose Uni-CoT, a Unified Chain-of-Thought framework that enables coherent and grounded multimodal reasoning within a single unified model. The key idea is to leverage a model capable of both image understanding and generation to reason over visual content and model evolving visual states. However, empowering a unified model to achieve that is non-trivial, given the high computational cost and the burden of training. To address this, Uni-CoT introduces a novel two-level reasoning paradigm: A Macro-Level CoT for high-level task planning and A Micro-Level CoT for subtask execution. This design significantly reduces the computational overhead. Furthermore, we introduce a structured training paradigm that combines interleaved image-text supervision for macro-level CoT with multi-task objectives for micro-level CoT. Together, these innovations allow Uni-CoT to perform scalable and coherent multi-modal reasoning. Furthermore, thanks to our design, all experiments can be efficiently completed using only 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB VRAM each. Experimental results on reasoning-driven image generation benchmark (WISE) and editing benchmarks (RISE and KRIS) indicates that Uni-CoT demonstrates SOTA performance and strong generalization, establishing Uni-CoT as a promising solution for multi-modal reasoning.

Recent studies have shown that abstract images-constructed by primitive shapes-can indeed convey visual semantic information to deep learning models. However, representations obtained from such images often fall short compared to those derived from traditional raster images. In this paper, we study the reasons behind this performance gap and investigate how much high-level semantic content can be captured at different abstraction levels. To this end, we introduce the Hierarchical Abstraction Image Dataset (HAID), a novel data collection that comprises abstract images generated from normal raster images at multiple levels of abstraction. We then train and evaluate conventional vision systems on HAID across various tasks including classification, segmentation, and object detection, providing a comprehensive study between rasterised and abstract image representations. We also discuss if the abstract image can be considered as a potentially effective format for conveying visual semantic information and contributing to vision tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> |

However, the random Gaussian noise used to start the diffusion process influences the final output, causing variations in image quality and prompt adherence. Existing noise-level optimization approaches generally rely on extra dataset construction, additional networks, or backpropagation-based optimization, limiting their practicality. In this paper, we propose Noise Level Guidance (NLG), a simple, efficient, and general noise-level optimization approach that refines initial noise by increasing the likelihood of its alignment with general guidance - requiring no additional training data, auxiliary networks, or backpropagation. The proposed NLG approach provides a unified framework generalizable to both conditional and unconditional diffusion models, accommodating various forms of diffusion-level guidance. Extensive experiments on five standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach enhances output generation quality and input condition adherence. By seamlessly integrating with existing guidance methods while maintaining computational efficiency, our method establishes NLG as a practical and scalable enhancement to diffusion models.

Many users must modify their prompts several times to ensure the generated images meet their expectations. While some methods focus on enhancing prompts to make the generated images fit user needs, the model is still hard to understand users' real needs, especially for non-expert users. In this research, we aim to enhance the visual parameter-tuning process, making the model user-friendly for individuals without specialized knowledge and better understand user needs. We propose a human-machine co-adaption strategy using mutual information between the user's prompts and the pictures under modification as the optimizing target to make the system better adapt to user needs. We find that an improved model can reduce the necessity for multiple rounds of adjustments. We also collect multi-round dialogue datasets with prompts and images pairs and user intent. Various experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in our proposed dataset. Our dataset and annotation tools will be available.</p></details> |  |

Existing safety methods typically refine prompts using large language models (LLMs), but they overlook the images produced, which can result in unsafe outputs or unnecessary changes to already safe prompts. To address this, we propose an iterative prompt refinement algorithm that uses Vision Language Models (VLMs) to analyze both the input prompts and the generated images. By leveraging visual feedback, our method refines prompts more effectively, improving safety while maintaining user intent and reliability comparable to existing LLM-based approaches. Additionally, we introduce a new dataset labeled with both textual and visual safety signals using off-the-shelf multi-modal LLM, enabling supervised fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach produces safer outputs without compromising alignment with user intent, offering a practical solution for generating safer T2I content.

The key innovations of ComfyGPT include: (1) consisting of four specialized agents to build a multi-agent workflow generation system: ReformatAgent, FlowAgent, RefineAgent, and ExecuteAgent; (2) focusing on generating precise node connections instead of entire workflows, improving generation accuracy; and (3) enhancing workflow generation through reinforcement learning. Moreover, we introduce FlowDataset, a large-scale dataset containing 13,571 workflow-description pairs, and FlowBench, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating workflow generation systems. Additionally, we propose four novel evaluation metrics: Format Validation (FV), Pass Accuracy (PA), Pass Instruct Alignment (PIA), and Pass Node Diversity (PND). Experimental results demonstrate that ComfyGPT significantly outperforms existing LLM-based methods in workflow generation, making it a significant step forward in this field.

Current fashion image editing techniques, though advanced with multimodal prompts and powerful diffusion models, often struggle to accurately identify editing regions and preserve the desired garment texture detail. To address these challenges, we introduce a new multimodal fashion image editing architecture based on latent diffusion models, called Detail-Preserved Diffusion Models (DPDEdit). DPDEdit guides the fashion image generation of diffusion models by integrating text prompts, region masks, human pose images, and garment texture images. To precisely locate the editing region, we first introduce Grounded-SAM to predict the editing region based on the user's textual description, and then combine it with other conditions to perform local editing. To transfer the detail of the given garment texture into the target fashion image, we propose a texture injection and refinement mechanism. Specifically, this mechanism employs a decoupled cross-attention layer to integrate textual descriptions and texture images, and incorporates an auxiliary U-Net to preserve the high-frequency details of generated garment texture. Additionally, we extend the VITON-HD dataset using a multimodal large language model to generate paired samples with texture images and textual descriptions. Extensive experiments show that our DPDEdit outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of image fidelity and coherence with the given multimodal inputs.</p></details> | 13 pages,12 figures |
| **[DiffGAN: A Test Generation Approach for Differential Testing of Deep Neural Networks for Image Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19794v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are increasingly deployed across applications. However, ensuring their reliability remains a challenge, and in many situations, alternative models with similar functionality and accuracy are available. Traditional accuracy-based evaluations often fail to capture behavioral differences between models, especially with limited test datasets, making it difficult to select or combine models effectively. Differential testing addresses this by generating test inputs that expose discrepancies in DNN model behavior. However, existing approaches face significant limitations: many rely on model internals or are constrained by available seed inputs. To address these challenges, we propose DiffGAN, a black-box test image generation approach for differential testing of DNN models. DiffGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II to generate diverse and valid triggering inputs that reveal behavioral discrepancies between models. DiffGAN employs two custom fitness functions, focusing on diversity and divergence, to guide the exploration of the GAN input space and identify discrepancies between models' outputs. By strategically searching this space, DiffGAN generates inputs with specific features that trigger differences in model behavior. DiffGAN is black-box, making it applicable in more situations. We evaluate DiffGAN on eight DNN model pairs trained on widely used image datasets. Our results show DiffGAN significantly outperforms a SOTA baseline, generating four times more triggering inputs, with greater diversity and validity, within the same budget. Additionally, the generated inputs improve the accuracy of a machine learning-based model selection mechanism, which selects the best-performing model based on input characteristics and can serve as a smart output voting mechanism when using alternative models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |

Existing works predominantly focus on output-level demographic distributions, which do not necessarily guarantee concept representations to be disentangled post-mitigation. We propose BiasMap, a model-agnostic framework for uncovering latent concept-level representational biases in stable diffusion models. BiasMap leverages cross-attention attribution maps to reveal structural entanglements between demographics (e.g., gender, race) and semantics (e.g., professions), going deeper into representational bias during the image generation. Using attribution maps of these concepts, we quantify the spatial demographics-semantics concept entanglement via Intersection over Union (IoU), offering a lens into bias that remains hidden in existing fairness discovery approaches. In addition, we further utilize BiasMap for bias mitigation through energy-guided diffusion sampling that directly modifies latent noise space and minimizes the expected SoftIoU during the denoising process. Our findings show that existing fairness interventions may reduce the output distributional gap but often fail to disentangle concept-level coupling, whereas our mitigation method can mitigate concept entanglement in image generation while complementing distributional bias mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of Synthetic Face Images: Accuracy, Robustness, Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17547v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An experimental study on detecting synthetic face images is presented. We collected a dataset, called FF5, of five fake face image generators, including recent diffusion models. We find that a simple model trained on a specific image generator can achieve near-perfect accuracy in separating synthetic and real images. The model handles common image distortions (reduced resolution, compression) by using data augmentation. Moreover, partial manipulations, where synthetic images are blended into real ones by inpainting, are identified and the area of the manipulation is localized by a simple model of YOLO architecture. However, the model turned out to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks and does not generalize to unseen generators. Failure to generalize to detect images produced by a newer generator also occurs for recent state-of-the-art methods, which we tested on Realistic Vision, a fine-tuned version of StabilityAI's Stable Diffusion image generator.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was presented at the DAGM German Conference on Pattern Recognition (GCPR), 2025</p></details> |
| **[AC-Refiner: Efficient Arithmetic Circuit Optimization Using Conditional Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02598v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arithmetic circuits, such as adders and multipliers, are fundamental components of digital systems, directly impacting the performance, power efficiency, and area footprint. However, optimizing these circuits remains challenging due to the vast design space and complex physical constraints. While recent deep learning-based approaches have shown promise, they struggle to consistently explore high-potential design variants, limiting their optimization efficiency. To address this challenge, we propose AC-Refiner, a novel arithmetic circuit optimization framework leveraging conditional diffusion models. Our key insight is to reframe arithmetic circuit synthesis as a conditional image generation task. By carefully conditioning the denoising diffusion process on target quality-of-results (QoRs), AC-Refiner consistently produces high-quality circuit designs. Furthermore, the explored designs are used to fine-tune the diffusion model, which focuses the exploration near the Pareto frontier. Experimental results demonstrate that AC-Refiner generates designs with superior Pareto optimality, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. The performance gain is further validated by integrating AC-Refiner into practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, to appear in ASP-DAC'26</p></details> |
| **[Double Helix Diffusion for Cross-Domain Anomaly Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12787v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2) the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation, connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image Tokenizer Needs Post-Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12474v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However, there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers, coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, 10 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2503.08354</p></details> |
| **[Layout-Conditioned Autoregressive Text-to-Image Generation via Structured Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12046v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While autoregressive (AR) models have demonstrated remarkable success in image generation, extending them to layout-conditioned generation remains challenging due to the sparse nature of layout conditions and the risk of feature entanglement. We present Structured Masking for AR-based Layout-to-Image (SMARLI), a novel framework for layoutto-image generation that effectively integrates spatial layout constraints into AR-based image generation. To equip AR model with layout control, a specially designed structured masking strategy is applied to attention computation to govern the interaction among the global prompt, layout, and image tokens. This design prevents mis-association between different regions and their descriptions while enabling sufficient injection of layout constraints into the generation process. To further enhance generation quality and layout accuracy, we incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) based post-training scheme with specially designed layout reward functions for next-set-based AR models. Experimental results demonstrate that SMARLI is able to seamlessly integrate layout tokens with text and image tokens without compromising generation quality. It achieves superior layoutaware control while maintaining the structural simplicity and generation efficiency of AR models.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[KB-DMGen: Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic Pose Masking for Human Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20083v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent methods using diffusion models have made significant progress in Human Image Generation (HIG) with various control signals such as pose priors. In HIG, both accurate human poses and coherent visual quality are crucial for image generation. However, most existing methods mainly focus on pose accuracy while neglecting overall image quality, often improving pose alignment at the cost of image quality. To address this, we propose Knowledge-Based Global Guidance and Dynamic pose Masking for human image Generation (KB-DMGen). The Knowledge Base (KB), implemented as a visual codebook, provides coarse, global guidance based on input text-related visual features, improving pose accuracy while maintaining image quality, while the Dynamic pose Mask (DM) offers fine-grained local control to enhance precise pose accuracy. By injecting KB and DM at different stages of the diffusion process, our framework enhances pose accuracy through both global and local control without compromising image quality. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of KB-DMGen, achieving new state-of-the-art results in terms of AP and CAP on the HumanArt dataset.

| **[Robust Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models: A Theoretical Perspective on Security and Robustness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12024v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved unprecedented success in image generation but pose increasing risks in terms of privacy, fairness, and security. A growing demand exists to \emph{erase} sensitive or harmful concepts (e.g., NSFW content, private individuals, artistic styles) from these models while preserving their overall generative capabilities. We introduce \textbf{SCORE} (Secure and Concept-Oriented Robust Erasure), a novel framework for robust concept removal in diffusion models. SCORE formulates concept erasure as an \emph{adversarial independence} problem, theoretically guaranteeing that the model's outputs become statistically independent of the erased concept. Unlike prior heuristic methods, SCORE minimizes the mutual information between a target concept and generated outputs, yielding provable erasure guarantees. We provide formal proofs establishing convergence properties and derive upper bounds on residual concept leakage. Empirically, we evaluate SCORE on Stable Diffusion and FLUX across four challenging benchmarks: object erasure, NSFW removal, celebrity face suppression, and artistic style unlearning. SCORE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods including EraseAnything, ANT, MACE, ESD, and UCE, achieving up to \textbf{12.5\%} higher erasure efficacy while maintaining comparable or superior image quality. By integrating adversarial optimization, trajectory consistency, and saliency-driven fine-tuning, SCORE sets a new standard for secure and robust concept erasure in diffusion models.</p></details> | Camera ready version |

It is difficult for dental professionals to strike a balance between esthetic requirements and functional requirements. Traditional smile design has had heavy reliance on dentist expertise and used plaster models and hand drawings, raising questions about the outcome for patients. Digital technology, led by Dr. Christian Coachman in 2007, allows photographic and videographic assessments, enabling improved intercommunication among specialists and patients. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have supported analysis of facial features and development of personalized smile designs in the last few years. Outputs are, however, susceptible to practitioner bias or limitations of training data, and may be suboptimal for individual users. The study presented here suggests a comprehensive system integrating AI, big data, and recognition technologies to automate the smile design process so that both experienced and inexperienced dentists can generate pleasing aesthetics with ease. The system has a Facial Feature Extraction Module and an Image Generation Module, serving diverse practitioner and patient needs. User data can be incorporated in future research for design optimization and testing of virtual and augmented reality for real-time previewing. Data gathered can also be employed in aesthetic preference analyses, which can enhance our knowledge of smile design in dental practice.</p></details> | 6 pages, 2 figures |
