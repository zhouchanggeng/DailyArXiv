| **[ProPy: Building Interactive Prompt Pyramids upon CLIP for Partially Relevant Video Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19024v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events, ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels, and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous models by significant margins.

| **[From Global to Local: Social Bias Transfer in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17750v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recycling of contrastive language-image pre-trained (CLIP) models as backbones for a large number of downstream tasks calls for a thorough analysis of their transferability implications, especially their well-documented reproduction of social biases and human stereotypes. How do such biases, learned during pre-training, propagate to downstream applications like visual question answering or image captioning? Do they transfer at all? We investigate this phenomenon, referred to as bias transfer in prior literature, through a comprehensive empirical analysis. Firstly, we examine how pre-training bias varies between global and local views of data, finding that bias measurement is highly dependent on the subset of data on which it is computed. Secondly, we analyze correlations between biases in the pre-trained models and the downstream tasks across varying levels of pre-training bias, finding difficulty in discovering consistent trends in bias transfer. Finally, we explore why this inconsistency occurs, showing that under the current paradigm, representation spaces of different pre-trained CLIPs tend to converge when adapted for downstream tasks. We hope this work offers valuable insights into bias behavior and informs future research to promote better bias mitigation practices.</p></details> |  |
| **[High-Capacity and Low-PAPR BICM-OFDM Systems Using Non-Equiprobable and Non-Uniform Constellation Shaping With Clipping and Filtering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15639v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address a design of high-capacity and low-peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems based on bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) utilizing non-equiprobable and non-uniform (NENU) constellations as well as clipping and filtering (CAF). The proposed constellations are generated using a truncated Gaussian distribution, and the merging of constellation points, where the former creates a non-uniform constellation (NUC), and the latter decreases the number of signal points without compromising the achievable bit-wise mutual information (BMI). Since the proposed constellations are uniquely determined by only the two parameters, each associated with NUC and cardinality, the complexity required for the numerical optimization process can be significantly low. We focus on the constellation design based on one dimension, i.e., pulse amplitude modulation (PAM), which facilitates the reduction of demapping complexity for the BICM receiver. The use of CAF at the transmitter can efficiently reduce the PAPR of OFDM signals; however, it introduces clipping noise that may degrade error rate performance, making the application of clipping noise cancellation (CNC) at the receiver essential. Therefore, we optimize the NENU constellations in the presence of CAF and CNC. Simulation results demonstrate that the combination of constellation shaping with CAF and CNC enables BICM-OFDM systems to simultaneously achieve low PAPR and high spectral efficiency over additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) as well as frequency-selective Rayleigh fading channels. Furthermore, comparative studies confirm that the proposed system significantly outperforms the single-carrier counterpart (i.e., DFT-precoded BICM-OFDM) in terms of PAPR and bit error rate (BER) performance over fading channels.</p></details> | 13 pages, 13 figures |
| **[DesignCLIP: Multimodal Learning with CLIP for Design Patent Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15297v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data. However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval, which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal approaches in advancing patent analysis.

| **[CLIPSym: Delving into Symmetry Detection with CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14197v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symmetry is one of the most fundamental geometric cues in computer vision, and detecting it has been an ongoing challenge. With the recent advances in vision-language models,~i.e., CLIP, we investigate whether a pre-trained CLIP model can aid symmetry detection by leveraging the additional symmetry cues found in the natural image descriptions. We propose CLIPSym, which leverages CLIP's image and language encoders and a rotation-equivariant decoder based on a hybrid of Transformer and $G$-Convolution to detect rotation and reflection symmetries. To fully utilize CLIP's language encoder, we have developed a novel prompting technique called Semantic-Aware Prompt Grouping (SAPG), which aggregates a diverse set of frequent object-based prompts to better integrate the semantic cues for symmetry detection. Empirically, we show that CLIPSym outperforms the current state-of-the-art on three standard symmetry detection datasets (DENDI, SDRW, and LDRS). Finally, we conduct detailed ablations verifying the benefits of CLIP's pre-training, the proposed equivariant decoder, and the SAPG technique.

| **[WP-CLIP: Leveraging CLIP to Predict WÃ¶lfflin's Principles in Visual Art](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12668v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>W\"olfflin's five principles offer a structured approach to analyzing stylistic variations for formal analysis. However, no existing metric effectively predicts all five principles in visual art. Computationally evaluating the visual aspects of a painting requires a metric that can interpret key elements such as color, composition, and thematic choices. Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated their ability to evaluate abstract image attributes, making them promising candidates for this task. In this work, we investigate whether CLIP, pre-trained on large-scale data, can understand and predict W\"olfflin's principles. Our findings indicate that it does not inherently capture such nuanced stylistic elements. To address this, we fine-tune CLIP on annotated datasets of real art images to predict a score for each principle. We evaluate our model, WP-CLIP, on GAN-generated paintings and the Pandora-18K art dataset, demonstrating its ability to generalize across diverse artistic styles. Our results highlight the potential of VLMs for automated art analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025 AI4VA workshop (oral), Code: https://github.com/abhijay9/wpclip</p></details> |
| **[Style Ambiguity Loss Using CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02055v3)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore using the style ambiguity training objective, originally used to approximate creativity, on a diffusion model. However, this objective requires the use of a pretrained classifier and a labeled dataset. We introduce new forms of style ambiguity loss that do not require training a new classifier or a labeled dataset. Instead of using a classifier, we generate centroids in the CLIP embedding space, and images are classified based on their relative distance to said centroids. We find the centroids via K-means clustering of an unlabeled dataset, as well as using text labels to generate CLIP embeddings, to be used as centroids.

| **[Continual Learning on CLIP via Incremental Prompt Tuning with Intrinsic Textual Anchors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20680v2)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) enables deep networks to acquire new knowledge while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. The powerful generalization ability of pre-trained models (PTMs), such as the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, has inspired a range of CL methods targeting new and specialized tasks, providing rich multi-modal embeddings that support lightweight, incremental prompt tuning. Existing methods often rely on complex designs built upon specific assumptions, such as intricate regularization schemes for prompt pools, specialized routing mechanisms, or multi-stage incrementations, that introduce additional-and possibly unnecessary-complexity, underutilizing CLIP's intrinsic capabilities. In this paper, we propose a concise CL approach for CLIP based on incremental prompt tuning that fully exploits its multi-modal structure and the stability of textual representations. Our method, Textual Prototype-guided Prompt Tuning (TPPT), introduces textual prototypes not merely as static classifiers, as in existing methods, but as stable anchors to guide the learning of visual prompts, thereby shaping the embedding space (i.e., TPPT-V). We show that our bidirectional supervision strategy enables more effective learning of new knowledge while reducing forgetting. To further close the vision-language gap during CL, we jointly optimizes visual and textual prompts (i.e., TPPT-VT). We also introduce a relational diversity regularization on the textual anchors to prevent embedding space collapse and mitigate correlated forgetting. Extensive experiments and analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, highlighting the benefits of leveraging CLIP's intrinsic guidance for continual adaptation.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[CLAIR: CLIP-Aided Weakly Supervised Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12290v1)** | 2025-08-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent growth of large foundation models that can easily generate pseudo-labels for huge quantity of unlabeled data makes unsupervised Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Image Retrieval (UZS-CDIR) less relevant. In this paper, we therefore turn our attention to weakly supervised ZS-CDIR (WSZS-CDIR) with noisy pseudo labels generated by large foundation models such as CLIP. To this end, we propose CLAIR to refine the noisy pseudo-labels with a confidence score from the similarity between the CLIP text and image features. Furthermore, we design inter-instance and inter-cluster contrastive losses to encode images into a class-aware latent space, and an inter-domain contrastive loss to alleviate domain discrepancies. We also learn a novel cross-domain mapping function in closed-form, using only CLIP text embeddings to project image features from one domain to another, thereby further aligning the image features for retrieval. Finally, we enhance the zero-shot generalization ability of our CLAIR to handle novel categories by introducing an extra set of learnable prompts. Extensive experiments are carried out using TUBerlin, Sketchy, Quickdraw, and DomainNet zero-shot datasets, where our CLAIR consistently shows superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | BMVC 2025 |
| **[TokLIP: Marry Visual Tokens to CLIP for Multimodal Comprehension and Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05422v2)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pioneering token-based works such as Chameleon and Emu3 have established a foundation for multimodal unification but face challenges of high training computational overhead and limited comprehension performance due to a lack of high-level semantics. In this paper, we introduce TokLIP, a visual tokenizer that enhances comprehension by semanticizing vector-quantized (VQ) tokens and incorporating CLIP-level semantics while enabling end-to-end multimodal autoregressive training with standard VQ tokens. TokLIP integrates a low-level discrete VQ tokenizer with a ViT-based token encoder to capture high-level continuous semantics. Unlike previous approaches (e.g., VILA-U) that discretize high-level features, TokLIP disentangles training objectives for comprehension and generation, allowing the direct application of advanced VQ tokenizers without the need for tailored quantization operations. Our empirical results demonstrate that TokLIP achieves exceptional data efficiency, empowering visual tokens with high-level semantic understanding while enhancing low-level generative capacity, making it well-suited for autoregressive Transformers in both comprehension and generation tasks. The code and models are available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TokLIP.</p></details> | Technical Report |
| **[A CLIP-based Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) Framework for Pedestrian Re-Identification in Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11218v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches. While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Differentially Private Federated Learning for Speech Recognition: Benchmarks, Adaptive Optimizers and Gradient Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00098v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been extensively studied, their application to automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains largely unexplored due to the challenges in training large transformer models. Specifically, large models further exacerbate issues in FL as they are particularly susceptible to gradient heterogeneity across layers, unlike the relatively uniform gradient behavior observed in shallow models. As a result, prior works struggle to converge with standard optimization techniques, even in the absence of DP mechanisms. To the best of our knowledge, no existing work establishes a competitive, practical recipe for FL with DP in the context of ASR. To address this gap, we establish \textbf{the first benchmark for FL with DP in end-to-end ASR}. Our approach centers on per-layer clipping and layer-wise gradient normalization: theoretical analysis reveals that these techniques together mitigate clipping bias and gradient heterogeneity across layers in deeper models. Consistent with these theoretical insights, our empirical results show that FL with DP is viable under strong privacy guarantees, provided a population of at least several million users. Specifically, we achieve user-level (7.2, $10^{-9}$)-DP (resp. (4.5, $10^{-9}$)-DP) with only a 1.3% (resp. 4.6%) absolute drop in word error rate when extrapolating to high (resp. low) population scales for FL with DP in ASR. Although our experiments focus on ASR, the underlying principles we uncover - particularly those concerning gradient heterogeneity and layer-wise gradient normalization - offer broader guidance for designing scalable, privacy-preserving FL algorithms for large models across domains. Code of all experiments and benchmarks is available at https://github.com/apple/ml-pfl4asr.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Clipping Improves Adam-Norm and AdaGrad-Norm when the Noise Is Heavy-Tailed](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04443v3)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Methods with adaptive stepsizes, such as AdaGrad and Adam, are essential for training modern Deep Learning models, especially Large Language Models. Typically, the noise in the stochastic gradients is heavy-tailed for the later ones. Gradient clipping provably helps to achieve good high-probability convergence for such noises. However, despite the similarity between AdaGrad/Adam and Clip-SGD, the current understanding of the high-probability convergence of AdaGrad/Adam-type methods is limited in this case. In this work, we prove that AdaGrad/Adam (and their delayed version) can have provably bad high-probability convergence if the noise is heavy-tailed. We also show that gradient clipping fixes this issue, i.e., we derive new high-probability convergence bounds with polylogarithmic dependence on the confidence level for AdaGrad-Norm and Adam-Norm with clipping and with/without delay for smooth convex/non-convex stochastic optimization with heavy-tailed noise. We extend our results to the case of AdaGrad/Adam with delayed stepsizes. Our empirical evaluations highlight the superiority of clipped versions of AdaGrad/Adam in handling the heavy-tailed noise.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025. 65 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Common Data Properties Limit Object-Attribute Binding in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07985v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive vision-language models like CLIP are used for a large variety of applications, such as zero-shot classification or as vision encoder for multi-modal models. Despite their popularity, their representations show major limitations. For instance, CLIP models learn bag-of-words representations and, as a consequence, fail to distinguish whether an image is of ``a yellow submarine and a blue bus'' or ``a blue submarine and a yellow bus''. Previous attempts to fix this issue added hard negatives during training or modified the architecture, but failed to resolve the problem in its entirety. We suspect that the missing insights to solve the binding problem for CLIP are hidden in arguably the most important part of learning algorithms: the data. In this work, we fill this gap by rigorously identifying the influence of data properties on CLIP's ability to learn binding using a synthetic dataset. We find that common properties of natural data such as low attribute density, incomplete captions, and the saliency bias, a tendency of human captioners to describe the object that is ``most salient'' to them, have a detrimental effect on binding performance. In contrast to common belief, we find that neither scaling the batch size, i.e., implicitly adding more hard negatives, nor explicitly creating hard negatives enables CLIP to learn reliable binding. Only when the data expresses our identified data properties does CLIP learn almost perfect binding.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at GCPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Viewpoint Consistency in 3D Generation via Structure Feature and CLIP Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02287v4)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in text-to-3D generation techniques, current methods often suffer from geometric inconsistencies, commonly referred to as the Janus Problem. This paper identifies the root cause of the Janus Problem: viewpoint generation bias in diffusion models, which creates a significant gap between the actual generated viewpoint and the expected one required for optimizing the 3D model. To address this issue, we propose a tuning-free approach called the Attention and CLIP Guidance (ACG) mechanism. ACG enhances desired viewpoints by adaptively controlling cross-attention maps, employs CLIP-based view-text similarities to filter out erroneous viewpoints, and uses a coarse-to-fine optimization strategy with staged prompts to progressively refine 3D generation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly reduces the Janus Problem without compromising generation speed, establishing ACG as an efficient, plug-and-play component for existing text-to-3D frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grounding Emotion Recognition with Visual Prototypes: VEGA -- Revisiting CLIP in MERC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06564v2)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Emotion Recognition in Conversations remains a challenging task due to the complex interplay of textual, acoustic and visual signals. While recent models have improved performance via advanced fusion strategies, they often lack psychologically meaningful priors to guide multimodal alignment. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP and propose a novel Visual Emotion Guided Anchoring (VEGA) mechanism that introduces class-level visual semantics into the fusion and classification process. Distinct from prior work that primarily utilizes CLIP's textual encoder, our approach leverages its image encoder to construct emotion-specific visual anchors based on facial exemplars. These anchors guide unimodal and multimodal features toward a perceptually grounded and psychologically aligned representation space, drawing inspiration from cognitive theories (prototypical emotion categories and multisensory integration). A stochastic anchor sampling strategy further enhances robustness by balancing semantic stability and intra-class diversity. Integrated into a dual-branch architecture with self-distillation, our VEGA-augmented model achieves sota performance on IEMOCAP and MELD.

| **[Explaining Caption-Image Interactions in CLIP Models with Second-Order Attributions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14153v4)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dual encoder architectures like Clip models map two types of inputs into a shared embedding space and predict similarities between them. Despite their wide application, it is, however, not understood how these models compare their two inputs. Common first-order feature-attribution methods explain importances of individual features and can, thus, only provide limited insights into dual encoders, whose predictions depend on interactions between features. In this paper, we first derive a second-order method enabling the attribution of predictions by any differentiable dual encoder onto feature-interactions between its inputs. Second, we apply our method to Clip models and show that they learn fine-grained correspondences between parts of captions and regions in images. They match objects across input modes and also account for mismatches. This intrinsic visual-linguistic grounding ability, however, varies heavily between object classes, exhibits pronounced out-of-domain effects and we can identify individual errors as well as systematic failure categories.

| **[Evolution of Low-Level and Texture Human-CLIP Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09814v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations, improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Klear-Reasoner: Advancing Reasoning Capability via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07629v2)** | 2025-08-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Klear-Reasoner, a model with long reasoning capabilities that demonstrates careful deliberation during problem solving, achieving outstanding performance across multiple benchmarks. Although there are already many excellent works related to inference models in the current community, there are still many problems with reproducing high-performance inference models due to incomplete disclosure of training details. This report provides an in-depth analysis of the reasoning model, covering the entire post-training workflow from data preparation and long Chain-of-Thought supervised fine-tuning (long CoT SFT) to reinforcement learning (RL), along with detailed ablation studies for each experimental component. For SFT data, our experiments show that a small number of high-quality data sources are more effective than a large number of diverse data sources, and that difficult samples can achieve better results without accuracy filtering. In addition, we investigate two key issues with current clipping mechanisms in RL: Clipping suppresses critical exploration signals and ignores suboptimal trajectories. To address these challenges, we propose Gradient-Preserving clipping Policy Optimization (GPPO) that gently backpropagates gradients from clipped tokens. GPPO not only enhances the model's exploration capacity but also improves its efficiency in learning from negative samples. Klear-Reasoner exhibits exceptional reasoning abilities in mathematics and programming, scoring 90.5% on AIME 2024, 83.2% on AIME 2025, 66.0% on LiveCodeBench V5 and 58.1% on LiveCodeBench V6.</p></details> |  |
| **[Advancing AI-Powered Medical Image Synthesis: Insights from MedVQA-GI Challenge Using CLIP, Fine-Tuned Stable Diffusion, and Dream-Booth + LoRA](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20667v2)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The MEDVQA-GI challenge addresses the integration of AI-driven text-to-image generative models in medical diagnostics, aiming to enhance diagnostic capabilities through synthetic image generation. Existing methods primarily focus on static image analysis and lack the dynamic generation of medical imagery from textual descriptions. This study intends to partially close this gap by introducing a novel approach based on fine-tuned generative models to generate dynamic, scalable, and precise images from textual descriptions. Particularly, our system integrates fine-tuned Stable Diffusion and DreamBooth models, as well as Low-Rank Adaptation (LORA), to generate high-fidelity medical images. The problem is around two sub-tasks namely: image synthesis (IS) and optimal prompt production (OPG). The former creates medical images via verbal prompts, whereas the latter provides prompts that produce high-quality images in specified categories. The study emphasizes the limitations of traditional medical image generation methods, such as hand sketching, constrained datasets, static procedures, and generic models. Our evaluation measures showed that Stable Diffusion surpasses CLIP and DreamBooth + LORA in terms of producing high-quality, diversified images. Specifically, Stable Diffusion had the lowest Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) scores (0.099 for single center, 0.064 for multi-center, and 0.067 for combined), indicating higher image quality. Furthermore, it had the highest average Inception Score (2.327 across all datasets), indicating exceptional diversity and quality. This advances the field of AI-powered medical diagnosis. Future research will concentrate on model refining, dataset augmentation, and ethical considerations for efficiently implementing these advances into clinical practice</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIPin: A Non-contrastive Plug-in to CLIP for Multimodal Semantic Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06434v1)** | 2025-08-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale natural image-text datasets, especially those automatically collected from the web, often suffer from loose semantic alignment due to weak supervision, while medical datasets tend to have high cross-modal correlation but low content diversity. These properties pose a common challenge for contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP): they hinder the model's ability to learn robust and generalizable representations. In this work, we propose CLIPin, a unified non-contrastive plug-in that can be seamlessly integrated into CLIP-style architectures to improve multimodal semantic alignment, providing stronger supervision and enhancing alignment robustness. Furthermore, two shared pre-projectors are designed for image and text modalities respectively to facilitate the integration of contrastive and non-contrastive learning in a parameter-compromise manner. Extensive experiments on diverse downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of CLIPin as a plug-and-play component compatible with various contrastive frameworks.

Existing methods that directly train LLMs or bridge LLMs and diffusion models usually suffer from costly training since the backbone LLMs have not seen image representations during pretraining. We present Bifrost-1, a unified framework that bridges pretrained multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) and diffusion models using patch-level CLIP image embeddings as latent variables, which are natively aligned with the MLLM's CLIP visual encoder. These patch-level image embeddings are integrated into the diffusion model with a lightweight adaptation of its ControlNet. To retain the original multimodal reasoning capabilities of MLLMs, we equip the MLLM with a visual generation branch initialized from the original MLLM parameters when predicting the patch-level image embeddings. By seamlessly integrating pretrained MLLMs and diffusion models with patch-level CLIP latents, our framework enables high-fidelity controllable image generation with significant training efficiency. Our experiments demonstrate that Bifrost-1 achieves comparable or better performance than previous methods in terms of visual fidelity and multimodal understanding, with substantially lower compute during training. We also provide comprehensive ablation studies showing the effectiveness of our design choices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://bifrost-1.github.io</p></details> |
| **[CLIP Meets Diffusion: A Synergistic Approach to Anomaly Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11772v2)** | 2025-08-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Anomaly detection is a complex problem due to the ambiguity in defining anomalies, the diversity of anomaly types (e.g., local and global defect), and the scarcity of training data. As such, it necessitates a comprehensive model capable of capturing both low-level and high-level features, even with limited data. To address this, we propose CLIPFUSION, a method that leverages both discriminative and generative foundation models. Specifically, the CLIP-based discriminative model excels at capturing global features, while the diffusion-based generative model effectively captures local details, creating a synergistic and complementary approach. Notably, we introduce a methodology for utilizing cross-attention maps and feature maps extracted from diffusion models specifically for anomaly detection. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (MVTec-AD, VisA) demonstrate that CLIPFUSION consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving outstanding performance in both anomaly segmentation and classification.

However, due to the immaturity of the technology, the quality of the generated images varies, so it is important to develop quality assessment techniques for the generated images. Although some models have been proposed to assess the quality of generated images, they are inadequate when faced with the ever-increasing and diverse categories of generated images. Consequently, the development of more advanced and effective models for evaluating the quality of generated images is urgently needed. Recent research has explored the significant potential of the visual language model CLIP in image quality assessment, finding that it performs well in evaluating the quality of natural images. However, its application to generated images has not been thoroughly investigated. In this paper, we build on this idea and further explore the potential of CLIP in evaluating the quality of generated images. We design CLIP-AGIQA, a CLIP-based regression model for quality assessment of generated images, leveraging rich visual and textual knowledge encapsulated in CLIP. Particularly, we implement multi-category learnable prompts to fully utilize the textual knowledge in CLIP for quality assessment. Extensive experiments on several generated image quality assessment benchmarks, including AGIQA-3K and AIGCIQA2023, demonstrate that CLIP-AGIQA outperforms existing IQA models, achieving excellent results in evaluating the quality of generated images.</p></details> | accepted by ICPR2024 |
| **[LeakyCLIP: Extracting Training Data from CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00756v2)** | 2025-08-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the memorization and privacy leakage risks in Contrastive Language--Image Pretraining (CLIP) is critical for ensuring the security of multimodal models. Recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of extracting sensitive training examples from diffusion models, with conditional diffusion models exhibiting a stronger tendency to memorize and leak information. In this work, we investigate data memorization and extraction risks in CLIP through the lens of CLIP inversion, a process that aims to reconstruct training images from text prompts. To this end, we introduce \textbf{LeakyCLIP}, a novel attack framework designed to achieve high-quality, semantically accurate image reconstruction from CLIP embeddings. We identify three key challenges in CLIP inversion: 1) non-robust features, 2) limited visual semantics in text embeddings, and 3) low reconstruction fidelity. To address these challenges, LeakyCLIP employs 1) adversarial fine-tuning to enhance optimization smoothness, 2) linear transformation-based embedding alignment, and 3) Stable Diffusion-based refinement to improve fidelity. Empirical results demonstrate the superiority of LeakyCLIP, achieving over 358% improvement in Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) for ViT-B-16 compared to baseline methods on LAION-2B subset. Furthermore, we uncover a pervasive leakage risk, showing that training data membership can even be successfully inferred from the metrics of low-fidelity reconstructions. Our work introduces a practical method for CLIP inversion while offering novel insights into the nature and scope of privacy risks in multimodal models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v1)** | 2025-08-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scendi Score: Prompt-Aware Diversity Evaluation via Schur Complement of CLIP Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18645v3)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of CLIP embeddings to assess the fidelity of samples produced by text-to-image generative models has been extensively explored in the literature. While the widely adopted CLIPScore, derived from the cosine similarity of text and image embeddings, effectively measures the alignment of a generated image, it does not quantify the diversity of images generated by a text-to-image model. In this work, we extend the application of CLIP embeddings to quantify and interpret the intrinsic diversity of text-to-image models, which are responsible for generating diverse images from similar text prompts, which we refer to as prompt-aware diversity. To achieve this, we propose a decomposition of the CLIP-based kernel covariance matrix of image data into text-based and non-text-based components. Using the Schur complement of the joint image-text kernel covariance matrix, we perform this decomposition and define the matrix-based entropy of the decomposed component as the Schur Complement ENtopy DIversity (Scendi) score, as a measure of the prompt-aware diversity for prompt-guided generative models. Additionally, we discuss the application of the Schur complement-based decomposition to nullify the influence of a given prompt on the CLIP embedding of an image, enabling focus or defocus of the embedded vectors on specific objects. We present several numerical results that apply our proposed Scendi score to evaluate text-to-image and LLM (text-to-text) models. Our numerical results indicate the success of the Scendi score in capturing the intrinsic diversity of prompt-guided generative models. The codebase is available at https://github.com/aziksh-ospanov/scendi-score.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harnessing Textual Semantic Priors for Knowledge Transfer and Refinement in CLIP-Driven Continual Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01579v1)** | 2025-08-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continual learning (CL) aims to equip models with the ability to learn from a stream of tasks without forgetting previous knowledge. With the progress of vision-language models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), their promise for CL has attracted increasing attention due to their strong generalizability. However, the potential of rich textual semantic priors in CLIP in addressing the stability-plasticity dilemma remains underexplored. During backbone training, most approaches transfer past knowledge without considering semantic relevance, leading to interference from unrelated tasks that disrupt the balance between stability and plasticity. Besides, while text-based classifiers provide strong generalization, they suffer from limited plasticity due to the inherent modality gap in CLIP. Visual classifiers help bridge this gap, but their prototypes lack rich and precise semantics. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic-Enriched Continual Adaptation (SECA), a unified framework that harnesses the anti-forgetting and structured nature of textual priors to guide semantic-aware knowledge transfer in the backbone and reinforce the semantic structure of the visual classifier. Specifically, a Semantic-Guided Adaptive Knowledge Transfer (SG-AKT) module is proposed to assess new images' relevance to diverse historical visual knowledge via textual cues, and aggregate relevant knowledge in an instance-adaptive manner as distillation signals. Moreover, a Semantic-Enhanced Visual Prototype Refinement (SE-VPR) module is introduced to refine visual prototypes using inter-class semantic relations captured in class-wise textual embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[CLIP Brings Better Features to Visual Aesthetics Learners](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15640v2)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Aesthetics Assessment (IAA) is a challenging task due to its subjective nature and expensive manual annotations. Recent large-scale vision-language models, such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), have shown their promising representation capability for various downstream tasks. However, the application of CLIP to resource-constrained and low-data IAA tasks remains limited. While few attempts to leverage CLIP in IAA have mainly focused on carefully designed prompts, we extend beyond this by allowing models from different domains and with different model sizes to acquire knowledge from CLIP. To achieve this, we propose a unified and flexible two-phase CLIP-based Semi-supervised Knowledge Distillation (CSKD) paradigm, aiming to learn a lightweight IAA model while leveraging CLIP's strong generalization capability. Specifically, CSKD employs a feature alignment strategy to facilitate the distillation of heterogeneous CLIP teacher and IAA student models, effectively transferring valuable features from pre-trained visual representations to two lightweight IAA models, respectively. To efficiently adapt to downstream IAA tasks in a low-data regime, the two strong visual aesthetics learners then conduct distillation with unlabeled examples for refining and transferring the task-specific knowledge collaboratively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed CSKD achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple widely used IAA benchmarks. Furthermore, analysis of attention distance and entropy before and after feature alignment shows the effective transfer of CLIP's feature representation to IAA models, which not only provides valuable guidance for the model initialization of IAA but also enhances the aesthetic feature representation of IAA models. Code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | ICME 2025 Oral |
| **[NS-Net: Decoupling CLIP Semantic Information through NULL-Space for Generalizable AI-Generated Image Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01248v1)** | 2025-08-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models, such as GANs and diffusion models, has facilitated the creation of highly realistic images, raising growing concerns over their misuse in security-sensitive domains. While existing detectors perform well under known generative settings, they often fail to generalize to unknown generative models, especially when semantic content between real and fake images is closely aligned. In this paper, we revisit the use of CLIP features for AI-generated image detection and uncover a critical limitation: the high-level semantic information embedded in CLIP's visual features hinders effective discrimination. To address this, we propose NS-Net, a novel detection framework that leverages NULL-Space projection to decouple semantic information from CLIP's visual features, followed by contrastive learning to capture intrinsic distributional differences between real and generated images. Furthermore, we design a Patch Selection strategy to preserve fine-grained artifacts by mitigating semantic bias caused by global image structures. Extensive experiments on an open-world benchmark comprising images generated by 40 diverse generative models show that NS-Net outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving a 7.4\% improvement in detection accuracy, thereby demonstrating strong generalization across both GAN- and diffusion-based image generation techniques.</p></details> |  |

Temporal processing, an extensively researched topic, is one such example that lacks a coherent understanding of its underlying mechanisms. In this study, we investigate temporal processing in a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent performing an interval timing task and explore potential biological counterparts to its emergent behavior. The agent was successfully trained to perform a duration production task, which involved marking successive occurrences of a target interval while viewing a video sequence. Analysis of the agent's internal states revealed oscillatory neural activations, a ubiquitous pattern in biological systems. Interestingly, the agent's actions were predominantly influenced by neurons exhibiting these oscillations with high amplitudes and frequencies corresponding to the target interval. Parallels are drawn between the agent's time-keeping strategy and the Striatal Beat Frequency (SBF) model, a biologically plausible model of interval timing. Furthermore, the agent maintained its oscillatory representations and task performance when tested on different video sequences (including a blank video). Thus, once learned, the agent internalized its time-keeping mechanism and showed minimal reliance on its environment to perform the timing task. A hypothesis about the resemblance between this emergent behavior and certain aspects of the evolution of biological processes like circadian rhythms, has been discussed. This study aims to contribute to recent research efforts of utilizing DNNs to understand biological systems, with a particular emphasis on temporal processing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 Artificial Life Conference</p></details> |
| **[StepWiser: Stepwise Generative Judges for Wiser Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19229v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e., meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict. Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.</p></details> |  |

We propose QuadKAN, a spline-parameterized cross-modal policy instantiated with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). The framework incorporates a spline encoder for proprioception and a spline fusion head for proprioception-vision inputs. This structured function class aligns the state-to-action mapping with the piecewise-smooth nature of gait, improving sample efficiency, reducing action jitter and energy consumption, and providing interpretable posture-action sensitivities. We adopt Multi-Modal Delay Randomization (MMDR) and perform end-to-end training with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Evaluations across diverse terrains, including both even and uneven surfaces and scenarios with static or dynamic obstacles, demonstrate that QuadKAN achieves consistently higher returns, greater distances, and fewer collisions than state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. These results show that spline-parameterized policies offer a simple, effective, and interpretable alternative for robust vision-guided locomotion. A repository will be made available upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>14pag...</summary><p>14pages, 9 figures, Journal paper</p></details> |
| **[Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but often overlooked dimension of intelligence. This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions, we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics. The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive entertainment. Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD D...</summary><p>PhD Dissertation, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, 2025.

However, its effectiveness is often limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input, especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers, estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings, including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the baselines for the blood glucose control task.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables plus appendices</p></details> |
| **[MCI-GRU: Stock Prediction Model Based on Multi-Head Cross-Attention and Improved GRU](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20679v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As financial markets grow increasingly complex in the big data era, accurate stock prediction has become more critical. Traditional time series models, such as GRUs, have been widely used but often struggle to capture the intricate nonlinear dynamics of markets, particularly in the flexible selection and effective utilization of key historical information. Recently, methods like Graph Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning have shown promise in stock prediction but require high data quality and quantity, and they tend to exhibit instability when dealing with data sparsity and noise. Moreover, the training and inference processes for these models are typically complex and computationally expensive, limiting their broad deployment in practical applications. Existing approaches also generally struggle to capture unobservable latent market states effectively, such as market sentiment and expectations, microstructural factors, and participant behavior patterns, leading to an inadequate understanding of market dynamics and subsequently impact prediction accuracy. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a stock prediction model, MCI-GRU, based on a multi-head cross-attention mechanism and an improved GRU. First, we enhance the GRU model by replacing the reset gate with an attention mechanism, thereby increasing the model's flexibility in selecting and utilizing historical information. Second, we design a multi-head cross-attention mechanism for learning unobservable latent market state representations, which are further enriched through interactions with both temporal features and cross-sectional features. Finally, extensive experiments on four main stock markets show that the proposed method outperforms SOTA techniques across multiple metrics. Additionally, its successful application in real-world fund management operations confirms its effectiveness and practicality.</p></details> |  |

Looking to solve this issue, previous work has shown that improved training efficiency can be achieved by separately modeling agent and environment, but usually requiring a supervisory agent mask. In contrast to RL, humans can perfect a new skill from a small number of trials and in most cases do so without a supervisory signal, making neuroscientific studies of human development a valuable source of inspiration for RL. In particular, we explore the idea of motor prediction, which states that humans develop an internal model of themselves and of the consequences that their motor commands have on the immediate sensory inputs. Our insight is that the movement of the agent provides a cue that allows the duality between agent and environment to be learned. To instantiate this idea, we present Ego-Foresight, a self-supervised method for disentangling agent and environment based on motion and prediction. Our main finding is self-supervised agent-awareness by visuomotor prediction of the agent improves sample-efficiency and performance of the underlying RL algorithm. To test our approach, we first study its ability to visually predict agent movement irrespective of the environment, in simulated and real-world robotic data. Then, we integrate Ego-Foresight with a model-free RL algorithm to solve simulated robotic tasks, showing that self-supervised agent-awareness can improve sample-efficiency and performance in RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, conference</p></details> |

When prior knowledge of the domain or task is unavailable, training RL agents in unknown, black-box environments presents an even greater safety risk. We introduce ADVICE (Adaptive Shielding with a Contrastive Autoencoder), a novel post-shielding technique that distinguishes safe and unsafe features of state-action pairs during training, and uses this knowledge to protect the RL agent from executing actions that yield likely hazardous outcomes. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art safe RL exploration techniques shows that ADVICE significantly reduces safety violations (approx 50%) during training, with a competitive outcome reward compared to other techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in ECAI 25</p></details> |

Beyond merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures. The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective partners in clinical practice and medical research.</p></details> |  |

However, scenes that satisfy strict task requirements, such as high-clutter environments with plausible spatial arrangement, are rare and costly to curate manually. Instead, we generate large-scale scene data using procedural models that approximate realistic environments for robotic manipulation, and adapt it to task-specific goals. We do this by training a unified diffusion-based generative model that predicts which objects to place from a fixed asset library, along with their SE(3) poses. This model serves as a flexible scene prior that can be adapted using reinforcement learning-based post training, conditional generation, or inference-time search, steering generation toward downstream objectives even when they differ from the original data distribution. Our method enables goal-directed scene synthesis that respects physical feasibility and scales across scene types. We introduce a novel MCTS-based inference-time search strategy for diffusion models, enforce feasibility via projection and simulation, and release a dataset of over 44 million SE(3) scenes spanning five diverse environments.

Not Anymore -- An Ensemble of RL Defenders Awakens for APT Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19072v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy, adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems. This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive, adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries. An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures robust final predictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MAB Optimizer for Estimating Math Question Difficulty via Inverse CV without NLP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19014v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential. Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based, NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii) variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability, supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic, self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Exploration Bottleneck: Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning for General LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16949v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have underscored the potential of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to facilitate the emergence of reasoning capabilities. Despite the encouraging results, a fundamental dilemma persists as RL improvement relies on learning from high-quality samples, yet the exploration for such samples remains bounded by the inherent limitations of LLMs. This, in effect, creates an undesirable cycle in which what cannot be explored cannot be learned. In this work, we propose Rubric-Scaffolded Reinforcement Learning (RuscaRL), a novel instructional scaffolding framework designed to break the exploration bottleneck for general LLM reasoning. Specifically, RuscaRL introduces checklist-style rubrics as (1) explicit scaffolding for exploration during rollout generation, where different rubrics are provided as external guidance within task instructions to steer diverse high-quality responses. This guidance is gradually decayed over time, encouraging the model to internalize the underlying reasoning patterns; (2) verifiable rewards for exploitation during model training, where we can obtain robust LLM-as-a-Judge scores using rubrics as references, enabling effective RL on general reasoning tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed RuscaRL across various benchmarks, effectively expanding reasoning boundaries under the best-of-N evaluation. Notably, RuscaRL significantly boosts Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 23.6 to 50.3 on HealthBench-500, surpassing GPT-4.1. Furthermore, our fine-tuned variant on Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct achieves 61.1 on HealthBench-500, outperforming leading LLMs including OpenAI-o3.

In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named \textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by 4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof) with merely 859 unlabeled data.

In contrast, artificial neural networks trained with reinforcement learning typically rely on backpropagation (BP), which limits their use in resource-constrained systems or with non-differentiable components. While noise-based alternatives, like reward-modulated Hebbian learning (RMHL), provide a biologically grounded framework for credit assignment, they struggle with temporal delays and hierarchical processing -key challenges in real-world learning. In this work, we derive a novel noise-based learning rule to address these challenges. Drawing inspiration from biological neural circuits, our method uses reward prediction errors as its optimization target to generate increasingly advantageous behavior, and incorporates an eligibility trace to facilitate retrospective credit assignment. Its formulation relies on local information, aligning with biological constraints and enabling neuromorphic implementation. Experimental validation on reinforcement tasks (immediate and delayed rewards) shows our approach significantly outperforms RMHL and achieves performance comparable to BP, although with slower convergence due to its noise-driven updates. While tested on simple architectures, the results highlight the potential of noise-driven, brain-inspired learning for low-power adaptive systems, particularly in scenarios where energy efficiency and biological plausibility are a priority. These findings also offer mechanistic insights into how dopamine-like signals and synaptic stochasticity may jointly enable learning in biological networks, bridging computational models with neurobiological principles.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAEPO: History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18884v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs). Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous (reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly, aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.</p></details> | Under review |

Traditional classifiers, without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning (AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent, simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a $5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment of the Android malware domain.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Acrobatic flight poses a particularly challenging problem due to its complex dynamics, rapid movements, and the importance of precise execution. In this work, we explore the use of PbRL for agile drone control, focusing on the execution of dynamic maneuvers such as powerloops. Building on Preference-based Proximal Policy Optimization (Preference PPO), we propose Reward Ensemble under Confidence (REC), an extension to the reward learning objective that improves preference modeling and learning stability. Our method achieves 88.4% of the shaped reward performance, compared to 55.2% with standard Preference PPO. We train policies in simulation and successfully transfer them to real-world drones, demonstrating multiple acrobatic maneuvers where human preferences emphasize stylistic qualities of motion. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our probabilistic reward model in a representative MuJoCo environment for continuous control. Finally, we highlight the limitations of manually designed rewards, observing only 60.7% agreement with human preferences. These results underscore the effectiveness of PbRL in capturing complex, human-centered objectives across both physical and simulated domains.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

With advancements in deep learning, large language models (LLMs), and edge computing, CETCI has made significant progress with emerging AIoT applications, moving beyond isolated layer optimization to deployable collaborative intelligence systems for AIoT (CISAIOT), a practical research focus in AI, distributed computing, and communications. This survey describes foundational architectures, enabling technologies, and scenarios of CETCI paradigms, offering a tutorial-style review for CISAIOT beginners. We systematically analyze architectural components spanning cloud, edge, and terminal layers, examining core technologies including network virtualization, container orchestration, and software-defined networking, while presenting categorizations of collaboration paradigms that cover task offloading, resource allocation, and optimization across heterogeneous infrastructures. Furthermore, we explain intelligent collaboration learning frameworks by reviewing advances in federated learning, distributed deep learning, edge-cloud model evolution, and reinforcement learning-based methods. Finally, we discuss challenges (e.g., scalability, heterogeneity, interoperability) and future trends (e.g., 6G+, agents, quantum computing, digital twin), highlighting how integration of distributed computing and communication can address open issues and guide development of robust, efficient, and secure collaborative AIoT systems.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose a general framework for learning and deploying impact-rich, rotation-intensive behaviors through centroidal velocity-based rewards and actuator-aware sim-to-real techniques. We identify that conventional link-level reward formulations fail to induce true whole-body rotation and introduce a centroidal angular velocity reward that accurately captures system-wide rotational dynamics. To bridge the sim-to-real gap under extreme conditions, we model motor operating regions (MOR) and apply transmission load regularization to ensure realistic torque commands and mechanical robustness. Using the one-leg hopper front flip as a representative case study, we demonstrate the first successful hardware realization of a full front flip. Our results highlight that incorporating centroidal dynamics and actuator constraints is critical for reliably executing highly dynamic motions.

Traditional methods based on encoder-decoder models have achieved certain success, but the application of LLMs in this field is still underexplored. Current research predominantly relies on supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs to directly generate the corrected sentence, which limits the model's powerful reasoning ability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework based on Rule-Based RL. Through experiments on the Chinese datasets, our Rule-Based RL framework achieves \textbf{state-of-the-art }performance, with a notable increase in \textbf{recall}. This result clearly highlights the advantages of using RL to steer LLMs, offering a more controllable and reliable paradigm for future development in GEC.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released upon publication</p></details> |

Recent proprietary systems like OpenAI's gpt-oss series have introduced discrete operational modes for intuitive reasoning control, but the open-source community has largely failed to achieve such capabilities. In this paper, we introduce ThinkDial, the first open-recipe end-to-end framework that successfully implements gpt-oss-style controllable reasoning through discrete operational modes. Our system enables seamless switching between three distinct reasoning regimes: High mode (full reasoning capability), Medium mode (50 percent token reduction with <10 percent performance degradation), and Low mode (75 percent token reduction with <15 percent performance degradation). We achieve this through an end-to-end training paradigm that integrates budget-mode control throughout the entire pipeline: budget-mode supervised fine-tuning that embeds controllable reasoning capabilities directly into the learning process, and two-phase budget-aware reinforcement learning with adaptive reward shaping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ThinkDial achieves target compression-performance trade-offs with clear response length reductions while maintaining performance thresholds. The framework also exhibits strong generalization capabilities on out-of-distribution tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual-CoG: Stage-Aware Reinforcement Learning with Chain of Guidance for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18032v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities. However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%, 5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Reinforcement Learning via Shuffle Privacy Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11647v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful tool for sequential decision-making, but its application is often hindered by privacy concerns arising from its interaction data. This challenge is particularly acute in advanced Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), where learning from operational and user data can expose systems to privacy inference attacks. Existing differential privacy (DP) models for RL are often inadequate: the centralized model requires a fully trusted server, creating a single point of failure risk, while the local model incurs significant performance degradation that is unsuitable for many control applications. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the emerging shuffle model of privacy, an intermediate trust model that provides strong privacy guarantees without a centralized trust assumption. We present Shuffle Differentially Private Policy Elimination (SDP-PE), the first generic policy elimination-based algorithm for episodic RL under the shuffle model. Our method introduces a novel exponential batching schedule and a ``forgetting'' mechanism to balance the competing demands of privacy and learning performance. Our analysis shows that SDP-PE achieves a near-optimal regret bound, demonstrating a superior privacy-regret trade-off that significantly outperforms the local model. This work establishes the viability of the shuffle model for secure data-driven control in advanced CPS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stability and Generalization for Bellman Residuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18741v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling. The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch SGD.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Quality: Unlocking Diversity in Ad Headline Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18739v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The generation of ad headlines plays a vital role in modern advertising, where both quality and diversity are essential to engage a broad range of audience segments. Current approaches primarily optimize language models for headline quality or click-through rates (CTR), often overlooking the need for diversity and resulting in homogeneous outputs. To address this limitation, we propose DIVER, a novel framework based on large language models (LLMs) that are jointly optimized for both diversity and quality. We first design a semantic- and stylistic-aware data generation pipeline that automatically produces high-quality training pairs with ad content and multiple diverse headlines. To achieve the goal of generating high-quality and diversified ad headlines within a single forward pass, we propose a multi-stage multi-objective optimization framework with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Experiments on real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that DIVER effectively balances quality and diversity. Deployed on a large-scale content-sharing platform serving hundreds of millions of users, our framework improves advertiser value (ADVV) and CTR by 4.0% and 1.4%.</p></details> |  |
| **[SDGO: Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization for Consistent Safety in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15648v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing tasks but remain vulnerable to jailbreaking attacks that induce harmful content generation. In this paper, we reveal a critical safety inconsistency: LLMs can more effectively identify harmful requests as discriminators than defend against them as generators. This insight inspires us to explore aligning the model's inherent discrimination and generation capabilities. To this end, we propose SDGO (Self-Discrimination-Guided Optimization), a reinforcement learning framework that leverages the model's own discrimination capabilities as a reward signal to enhance generation safety through iterative self-improvement. Our method does not require any additional annotated data or external models during the training phase. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SDGO significantly improves model safety compared to both prompt-based and training-based baselines while maintaining helpfulness on general benchmarks. By aligning LLMs' discrimination and generation capabilities, SDGO brings robust performance against out-of-distribution (OOD) jailbreaking attacks. This alignment achieves tighter coupling between these two capabilities, enabling the model's generation capability to be further enhanced with only a small amount of discriminative samples. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/SDGO.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 (Main Conference), 15 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Skill-Aligned Fairness in Multi-Agent Learning for Collaboration in Healthcare](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18708v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fairness in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is often framed as a workload balance problem, overlooking agent expertise and the structured coordination required in real-world domains. In healthcare, equitable task allocation requires workload balance or expertise alignment to prevent burnout and overuse of highly skilled agents. Workload balance refers to distributing an approximately equal number of subtasks or equalised effort across healthcare workers, regardless of their expertise. We make two contributions to address this problem. First, we propose FairSkillMARL, a framework that defines fairness as the dual objective of workload balance and skill-task alignment. Second, we introduce MARLHospital, a customizable healthcare-inspired environment for modeling team compositions and energy-constrained scheduling impacts on fairness, as no existing simulators are well-suited for this problem. We conducted experiments to compare FairSkillMARL in conjunction with four standard MARL methods, and against two state-of-the-art fairness metrics. Our results suggest that fairness based solely on equal workload might lead to task-skill mismatches and highlight the need for more robust metrics that capture skill-task misalignment. Our work provides tools and a foundation for studying fairness in heterogeneous multi-agent systems where aligning effort with expertise is critical.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel technique for training sensorimotor policies with reinforcement learning by imitating predictive models of human motions. Our key insight is that the motion of keypoints on human-inspired robot end-effectors closely mirrors the motion of corresponding human body keypoints. This enables us to use a model trained to predict future motion on human data \emph{zero-shot} on robot data. We train sensorimotor policies to track the predictions of such a model, conditioned on a history of past robot states, while optimizing a relatively sparse task reward. This approach entirely bypasses gradient-based kinematic retargeting and adversarial losses, which limit existing methods from fully leveraging the scale and diversity of modern human-scene interaction datasets. Empirically, we find that our approach can work across robots and tasks, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin. In addition, we find that tracking a human motion model can substitute for carefully designed dense rewards and curricula in manipulation tasks.

In these setups, typical safe reinforcement learning algorithms constrain agents' behavior, limiting exploration -- a crucial component for discovering effective cooperative multiagent behaviors. Moreover, the multiagent literature typically models individual constraints for each agent and has yet to investigate the benefits of using joint team constraints. In this work, we analyze these team constraints from a theoretical and practical perspective and propose entropic exploration for constrained multiagent reinforcement learning (E2C) to address the exploration issue. E2C leverages observation entropy maximization to incentivize exploration and facilitate learning safe and effective cooperative behaviors. Experiments across increasingly complex domains show that E2C agents match or surpass common unconstrained and constrained baselines in task performance while reducing unsafe behaviors by up to $50\%$.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

However, it faced challenges when it came to distinguishing between shadows and their backgrounds. To address this, we developed Deshadow-Anything, considering the generalization of large-scale datasets, and we performed Fine-tuning on large-scale datasets to achieve image shadow removal. The diffusion model can diffuse along the edges and textures of an image, helping to remove shadows while preserving the details of the image. Furthermore, we design Multi-Self-Attention Guidance (MSAG) and adaptive input perturbation (DDPM-AIP) to accelerate the iterative training speed of diffusion.

However, existing 2.5D-based models primarily adopt a single encoder to extract features of target and neighborhood slices, failing to effectively fuse inter-slice information, resulting in suboptimal segmentation performance. In this study, a novel momentum encoder-based inter-slice fusion transformer (MOSformer) is proposed to overcome this issue by leveraging inter-slice information from multi-scale feature maps extracted by different encoders. Specifically, dual encoders are employed to enhance feature distinguishability among different slices. One of the encoders is moving-averaged to maintain consistent slice representations. Moreover, an inter-slice fusion transformer (IF-Trans) module is developed to fuse inter-slice multi-scale features. MOSformer is evaluated on three benchmark datasets (Synapse, ACDC, and AMOS), achieving a new state-of-the-art with 85.63%, 92.19%, and 85.43% DSC, respectively. These results demonstrate MOSformer's competitiveness in medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables. Under Review</p></details> |

However, real-world deployment is stymied by the need for high-quality, meticulously labeled datasets. Synthetic data provides high-quality labels while reducing the need for manual data collection and annotation. However, deep neural networks trained on synthetic data often face the Syn2Real problem, leading to poor performance in real-world deployments. To mitigate the aforementioned gap in image segmentation, we propose RAFT, a novel framework for adapting image segmentation models using minimal labeled real-world data through data and feature augmentations, as well as active learning. To validate RAFT, we perform experiments on the synthetic-to-real "SYNTHIA->Cityscapes" and "GTAV->Cityscapes" benchmarks. We managed to surpass the previous state of the art, HALO. SYNTHIA->Cityscapes experiences an improvement in mIoU* upon domain adaptation of 2.1%/79.9%, and GTAV->Cityscapes experiences a 0.4%/78.2% improvement in mIoU. Furthermore, we test our approach on the real-to-real benchmark of "Cityscapes->ACDC", and again surpass HALO, with a gain in mIoU upon adaptation of 1.3%/73.2%. Finally, we examine the effect of the allocated annotation budget and various components of RAFT upon the final transfer mIoU.</p></details> |  |

Currently, annotation is primarily performed through manual segmentation or classical methods, such as the Frangi filter, which often lack sufficient accuracy. Neural networks have emerged as powerful tools for medical image segmentation, but their development depends on well-annotated training datasets. However, there is a notable lack of publicly available MRA datasets with detailed brain vessel annotations. To address this gap, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning lightweight neural network with Hessian matrices on board for 3D segmentation of complex structures such as tubular structures, which we named HessNet. The solution is a Hessian-based neural network with only 6000 parameters. HessNet can run on the CPU and significantly reduces the resource requirements for training neural networks. The accuracy of vessel segmentation on a minimal training dataset reaches state-of-the-art results. It helps us create a large, semi-manually annotated brain vessel dataset of brain MRA images based on the IXI dataset (annotated 200 images). Annotation was performed by three experts under the supervision of three neurovascular surgeons after applying HessNet. It provides high accuracy of vessel segmentation and allows experts to focus only on the most complex important cases.

Nevertheless, the inherent heterogeneity among MRI sequences poses significant challenges to the generalization capability of deep learning models. These challenges undermine model performance when faced with varying acquisition parameters, thereby severely restricting their clinical utility. In this study, we present PRISM, a foundation model PRe-trained with large-scale multI-Sequence MRI. We collected a total of 64 datasets from both public and private sources, encompassing a wide range of whole-body anatomical structures, with scans spanning diverse MRI sequences. Among them, 336,476 volumetric MRI scans from 34 datasets (8 public and 26 private) were curated to construct the largest multi-organ multi-sequence MRI pretraining corpus to date. We propose a novel pretraining paradigm that disentangles anatomically invariant features from sequence-specific variations in MRI, while preserving high-level semantic representations. We established a benchmark comprising 44 downstream tasks, including disease diagnosis, image segmentation, registration, progression prediction, and report generation. These tasks were evaluated on 32 public datasets and 5 private cohorts. PRISM consistently outperformed both non-pretrained models and existing foundation models, achieving first-rank results in 39 out of 44 downstream benchmarks with statistical significance improvements. These results underscore its ability to learn robust and generalizable representations across unseen data acquired under diverse MRI protocols. PRISM provides a scalable framework for multi-sequence MRI analysis, thereby enhancing the translational potential of AI in radiology. It delivers consistent performance across diverse imaging protocols, reinforcing its clinical applicability.</p></details> |  |

Prevailing methods, often limited by shallow feature representation, inadequate reasoning mechanisms, and weak cross-modal integration, struggle to achieve this depth of cognition, resulting in prevalent issues like incomplete target separation and imprecise segmentation. Inspired by the perceptual strategy of the Hundred-eyed Giant-emphasizing holistic observation, omnidirectional focus, and intensive scrutiny-we introduce ArgusCogito, a novel zero-shot, chain-of-thought framework underpinned by cross-modal synergy and omnidirectional reasoning within Vision-Language Models (VLMs). ArgusCogito orchestrates three cognitively-inspired stages: (1) Conjecture: Constructs a strong cognitive prior through global reasoning with cross-modal fusion (RGB, depth, semantic maps), enabling holistic scene understanding and enhanced target-background disambiguation. (2) Focus: Performs omnidirectional, attention-driven scanning and focused reasoning, guided by semantic priors from Conjecture, enabling precise target localization and region-of-interest refinement. (3) Sculpting: Progressively sculpts high-fidelity segmentation masks by integrating cross-modal information and iteratively generating dense positive/negative point prompts within focused regions, emulating Argus' intensive scrutiny. Extensive evaluations on four challenging COS benchmarks and three Medical Image Segmentation (MIS) benchmarks demonstrate that ArgusCogito achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, validating the framework's exceptional efficacy, superior generalization capability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |

A key challenge in such systems is the effective fusion of features from different modalities, which requires the extraction of rich and diverse semantic representations from each modality. To this end, we propose ProMSC-MIS, a Prompt-based Multimodal Semantic Communication system for Multi-spectral Image Segmentation. Specifically, we propose a pre-training algorithm where features from one modality serve as prompts for another, guiding unimodal semantic encoders to learn diverse and complementary semantic representations. We further introduce a semantic fusion module that combines cross-attention mechanisms and squeeze-and-excitation (SE) networks to effectively fuse cross-modal features. Simulation results show that ProMSC-MIS significantly outperforms benchmark methods across various channel-source compression levels, while maintaining low computational complexity and storage overhead. Our scheme has great potential for applications such as autonomous driving and nighttime surveillance.</p></details> |  |

Generated samples undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVAMD Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To overcome these, we propose E-BayesSAM, an efficient framework combining Token-wise Variational Bayesian Inference (T-VBI) for efficienty Bayesian adaptation and Self-Optimizing Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (SO-KAN) for improving interpretability. T-VBI innovatively reinterprets SAM's output tokens as dynamic probabilistic weights and reparameterizes them as latent variables without auxiliary training, enabling training-free VBI for uncertainty estimation. SO-KAN improves token prediction with learnable spline activations via self-supervised learning, providing insight to prune redundant tokens to boost efficiency and accuracy. Experiments on five ultrasound datasets demonstrated that E-BayesSAM achieves: (i) real-time inference (0.03s/image), (ii) superior segmentation accuracy (average DSC: Pruned E-BayesSAM's 89.0\% vs. E-BayesSAM's 88.0% vs. MedSAM's 88.3%), and (iii) identification of four critical tokens governing SAM's decisions. By unifying efficiency, reliability, and interpretability, E-BayesSAM bridges SAM's versatility with clinical needs, advancing deployment in safety-critical medical applications.

Fine-tuning these models typically requires significant manual effort and domain expertise. In this work, we introduce QTT-SEG, a meta-learning-driven approach for automating and accelerating the fine-tuning of SAM for image segmentation. Built on the Quick-Tune hyperparameter optimization framework, QTT-SEG predicts high-performing configurations using meta-learned cost and performance models, efficiently navigating a search space of over 200 million possibilities. We evaluate QTT-SEG on eight binary and five multiclass segmentation datasets under tight time constraints. Our results show that QTT-SEG consistently improves upon SAM's zero-shot performance and surpasses AutoGluon Multimodal, a strong AutoML baseline, on most binary tasks within three minutes. On multiclass datasets, QTT-SEG delivers consistent gains as well. These findings highlight the promise of meta-learning in automating model adaptation for specialized segmentation tasks.

| **[Unlocking Robust Semantic Segmentation Performance via Label-only Elastic Deformations against Implicit Label Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10383v2)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While previous studies on image segmentation focus on handling severe (or explicit) label noise, real-world datasets also exhibit subtle (or implicit) label imperfections. These arise from inherent challenges, such as ambiguous object boundaries and annotator variability. Although not explicitly present, such mild and latent noise can still impair model performance. Typical data augmentation methods, which apply identical transformations to the image and its label, risk amplifying these subtle imperfections and limiting the model's generalization capacity. In this paper, we introduce NSegment+, a novel augmentation framework that decouples image and label transformations to address such realistic noise for semantic segmentation. By introducing controlled elastic deformations only to segmentation labels while preserving the original images, our method encourages models to focus on learning robust representations of object structures despite minor label inconsistencies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NSegment+ consistently improves performance, achieving mIoU gains of up to +2.29, +2.38, +1.75, and +3.39 in average on Vaihingen, LoveDA, Cityscapes, and PASCAL VOC, respectively-even without bells and whistles, highlighting the importance of addressing implicit label noise. These gains can be further amplified when combined with other training tricks, including CutMix and Label Smoothing.</p></details> |  |
| **[LGMSNet: Thinning a medical image segmentation model via dual-level multiscale fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15476v1)** | 2025-08-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However, existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally, current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios.

The quality of tongue surface segmentation significantly affects the accuracy of tongue image classification and subsequent diagnosis in intelligent tongue diagnosis systems. However, existing research on tongue image segmentation faces notable limitations, and there is a lack of robust and user-friendly segmentation tools. This paper proposes a tongue image segmentation model (TOM) based on multi-teacher knowledge distillation. By incorporating a novel diffusion-based data augmentation method, we enhanced the generalization ability of the segmentation model while reducing its parameter size. Notably, after reducing the parameter count by 96.6% compared to the teacher models, the student model still achieves an impressive segmentation performance of 95.22% mIoU. Furthermore, we packaged and deployed the trained model as both an online and offline segmentation tool (available at https://itongue.cn/), allowing TCM practitioners and researchers to use it without any programming experience. We also present a case study on TCM constitution classification using segmented tongue patches. Experimental results demonstrate that training with tongue patches yields higher classification performance and better interpretability than original tongue images. To our knowledge, this is the first open-source and freely available tongue image segmentation tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tongu...</summary><p>Tongue segmentation, data augmentation, synthetic data for AI training, prompt engineering, Segment Anything Model, knowledge distillation, tongue classification</p></details> |

One such application in real estate could be visualizing a room at different times of day and placing virtual light fixtures. Existing deep learning-based relighting techniques typically exceed the real-time performance capabilities of current MR devices. On the other hand, scene understanding methods, such as on-device scene reconstruction, often yield inaccurate results due to scanning limitations, in turn affecting relighting quality. Finally, simpler 2D image filter-based approaches cannot represent complex geometry and shadows. We introduce a novel method to integrate image segmentation, with lighting propagation via anisotropic diffusion on top of basic scene understanding, and the computational simplicity of filter-based techniques. Our approach corrects on-device scanning inaccuracies, delivering visually appealing and accurate relighting effects in real-time on edge devices, achieving speeds as high as 100 fps. We show a direct comparison between our method and the industry standard, and present a practical demonstration of our method in the aforementioned real estate example.</p></details> |  |
| **[LENS: Learning to Segment Anything with Unified Reinforced Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14153v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-prompted image segmentation enables fine-grained visual understanding and is critical for applications such as human-computer interaction and robotics. However, existing supervised fine-tuning methods typically ignore explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning at test time, which limits their ability to generalize to unseen prompts and domains. To address this issue, we introduce LENS, a scalable reinforcement-learning framework that jointly optimizes the reasoning process and segmentation in an end-to-end manner. We propose unified reinforcement-learning rewards that span sentence-, box-, and segment-level cues, encouraging the model to generate informative CoT rationales while refining mask quality. Using a publicly available 3-billion-parameter vision-language model, i.e., Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct, LENS achieves an average cIoU of 81.2% on the RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg benchmarks, outperforming the strong fine-tuned method, i.e., GLaMM, by up to 5.6%. These results demonstrate that RL-driven CoT reasoning serves as a robust prior for text-prompted segmentation and offers a practical path toward more generalizable Segment Anything models.

| **[MMIS-Net for Retinal Fluid Segmentation and Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13936v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Purpose: Deep learning methods have shown promising results in the segmentation, and detection of diseases in medical images. However, most methods are trained and tested on data from a single source, modality, organ, or disease type, overlooking the combined potential of other available annotated data. Numerous small annotated medical image datasets from various modalities, organs, and diseases are publicly available. In this work, we aim to leverage the synergistic potential of these datasets to improve performance on unseen data. Approach: To this end, we propose a novel algorithm called MMIS-Net (MultiModal Medical Image Segmentation Network), which features Similarity Fusion blocks that utilize supervision and pixel-wise similarity knowledge selection for feature map fusion. Additionally, to address inconsistent class definitions and label contradictions, we created a one-hot label space to handle classes absent in one dataset but annotated in another. MMIS-Net was trained on 10 datasets encompassing 19 organs across 2 modalities to build a single model. Results: The algorithm was evaluated on the RETOUCH grand challenge hidden test set, outperforming large foundation models for medical image segmentation and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We achieved the best mean Dice score of 0.83 and an absolute volume difference of 0.035 for the fluids segmentation task, as well as a perfect Area Under the Curve of 1 for the fluid detection task. Conclusion: The quantitative results highlight the effectiveness of our proposed model due to the incorporation of Similarity Fusion blocks into the network's backbone for supervision and similarity knowledge selection, and the use of a one-hot label space to address label class inconsistencies and contradictions.</p></details> |  |
| **[SCRNet: Spatial-Channel Regulation Network for Medical Ultrasound Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13899v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM) designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM), the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 8 pagegs |

We integrate clinical radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion. Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps, and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new bar for trustworthy, multimodal medical architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blast Hole Seeking and Dipping -- The Navigation and Perception Framework in a Mine Site Inspection Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13785v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In open-pit mining, holes are drilled into the surface of the excavation site and detonated with explosives to facilitate digging. These blast holes need to be inspected internally for investigation of downhole material types and properties. Knowing these properties can lead to significant savings in material handling costs in downstream processes. Manual hole inspection is slow and expensive, with major limitations in revealing the geometric and geological properties of the holes and their contents. This has been the motivation for the development of our autonomous mine-site inspection robot - "DIPPeR". In this paper, the automation aspect of the project is explained. We present a robust blast hole seeking and detection framework that enables target-based navigation and accurate down-hole sensor positioning. The pipeline first processes point-cloud data collected by the on-board LiDAR sensors, extracting the cone-shaped volume of drill-waste above the ground. By projecting the 3D cone points into a virtual depth image, segmentation is achieved in the 2D domain, yielding a circular hole at the image centre and a collared cone face. We then identify the hole centre using a robust detection module while suppressing non-maximum candidates, ensuring precise sensor placement for down-hole inspection and avoiding collisions with the cavity wall. To enable autonomous hole-seeking, the pipeline automatically adjusts its projection parameters during robot navigation to account for variations in point sparsity and hole opening size, ensuring a consistent hole appearance in 2D images. This allows continuous tracking of the target hole as the robot approaches the goal point. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our navigation and perception system in both high-fidelity simulation environments and on-site field tests.

| **[Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13712v1)** | 2025-08-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently, advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g., yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20% labeled data.</p></details> |  |

However, current methods face major challenges in clinical applications due to limited annotated data and restricted category definitions. To address these limitations, we propose PathSegmentor, the first text-prompted segmentation foundation model designed specifically for pathology images. We also introduce PathSeg, the largest and most comprehensive dataset for pathology segmentation, built from 21 public sources and containing 275k image-mask-label triples across 160 diverse categories. With PathSegmentor, users can perform semantic segmentation using natural language prompts, eliminating the need for laborious spatial inputs such as points or boxes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PathSegmentor outperforms specialized models with higher accuracy and broader applicability, while maintaining a compact architecture. It significantly surpasses existing spatial- and text-prompted models by 0.145 and 0.429 in overall Dice scores, respectively, showing strong robustness in segmenting complex structures and generalizing to external datasets. Moreover, PathSegmentor's outputs enhance the interpretability of diagnostic models through feature importance estimation and imaging biomarker discovery, offering pathologists evidence-based support for clinical decision-making. This work advances the development of explainable AI in precision oncology.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by the known sensitivity of methods to dataset challenges, such as small training sets, noisy labels, and out-of-distribution test-set images, TopoMortar is created to enable in two ways investigating methods' effectiveness at improving topology accuracy. First, by eliminating dataset challenges that, as we show, impact the effectiveness of topology loss functions. Second, by allowing to represent different dataset challenges in the same dataset, isolating methods' performance from dataset challenges. TopoMortar includes three types of labels (accurate, pseudo-labels, and noisy labels), two fixed training sets (large and small), and in-distribution and out-of-distribution test-set images. We compared eight loss functions on TopoMortar, and we found that clDice achieved the most topologically accurate segmentations, and that the relative advantageousness of the other loss functions depends on the experimental setting. Additionally, we show that data augmentation and self-distillation can elevate Cross entropy Dice loss to surpass most topology loss functions, and that those simple methods can enhance topology loss functions as well.

By adding a diffusion term into the level set evolution (LSE) equation of the proposed model, we construct a reaction-diffusion (RD) equation, which can gradually regularize the level set function (LSF) to be piecewise constant in each segment domain and gain the stable solution. We further transform the proposed model into classic ROF model by adding a proximity term.

| **[Diffusion Based Ambiguous Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05977v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation often involves inherent uncertainty due to variations in expert annotations. Capturing this uncertainty is an important goal and previous works have used various generative image models for the purpose of representing the full distribution of plausible expert ground truths. In this work, we explore the design space of diffusion models for generative segmentation, investigating the impact of noise schedules, prediction types, and loss weightings. Notably, we find that making the noise schedule harder with input scaling significantly improves performance. We conclude that x- and v-prediction outperform epsilon-prediction, likely because the diffusion process is in the discrete segmentation domain. Many loss weightings achieve similar performance as long as they give enough weight to the end of the diffusion process. We base our experiments on the LIDC-IDRI lung lesion dataset and obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. Additionally, we introduce a randomly cropped variant of the LIDC-IDRI dataset that is better suited for uncertainty in image segmentation. Our model also achieves SOTA in this harder setting.</p></details> | Accepted at SCIA25 |
| **[Unified and Semantically Grounded Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08660v2)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting, where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth shape manipulation.</p></details> |  |

While existing methods leverage multiple depth cues (e.g., estimating depth uncertainty, modeling depth error) to improve depth accuracy, they overlook that accurate depth prediction requires conditioning on other 3D attributes, as these attributes are intrinsically inter-correlated through the 3D to 2D projection, which ultimately limits overall accuracy and stability. Inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in large language models (LLMs), this paper proposes MonoCoP, which leverages a Chain-of-Prediction (CoP) to predict attributes sequentially and conditionally via three key designs. First, it employs a lightweight AttributeNet (AN) for each 3D attribute to learn attribute-specific features. Next, MonoCoP constructs an explicit chain to propagate these learned features from one attribute to the next. Finally, MonoCoP uses a residual connection to aggregate features for each attribute along the chain, ensuring that later attribute predictions are conditioned on all previously processed attributes without forgetting the features of earlier ones. Experimental results show that our MonoCoP achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) performance on the KITTI leaderboard without requiring additional data and further surpasses existing methods on the Waymo and nuScenes frontal datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>I pla...</summary><p>I plan to re-format and re-write this paper</p></details> |

These systems interact with extensive networks of vehicles, roadside infrastructure, and cloud resources to support their machine learning capabilities. However, the widespread use of machine learning in V2X systems raises issues over the privacy of the data involved. This is particularly concerning for smart-transit and driver safety applications which can implicitly reveal user locations or explicitly disclose medical data such as EEG signals. To resolve these issues, we propose SecureV2X, a scalable, multi-agent system for secure neural network inferences deployed between the server and each vehicle. Under this setting, we study two multi-agent V2X applications: secure drowsiness detection, and secure red-light violation detection. Our system achieves strong performance relative to baselines, and scales efficiently to support a large number of secure computation interactions simultaneously. For instance, SecureV2X is $9.4 \times$ faster, requires $143\times$ fewer computational rounds, and involves $16.6\times$ less communication on drowsiness detection compared to other secure systems.

While recent approaches have primarily focused on achieving feature invariance, they ignore that domain diversity also presents significant challenges for the task. First, such invariance-driven strategies often lead to the loss of domain-specific information, resulting in incomplete feature representations. Second, cross-domain feature alignment forces the model to overlook domain-specific discrepancies, thereby increasing the complexity of the training process. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Diversity Invariant Detection Model (DIDM), which achieves a harmonious integration of domain-specific diversity and domain invariance. Our key idea is to learn the invariant representations by keeping the inherent domain-specific features. Specifically, we introduce the Diversity Learning Module (DLM). This module limits the invariant semantics while explicitly enhancing domain-specific feature representation through a proposed feature diversity loss. Furthermore, to ensure cross-domain invariance without sacrificing diversity, we incorporate the Weighted Aligning Module (WAM) to enable feature alignment while maintaining the discriminative domain-specific information. Extensive experiments on multiple diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, achieving superior performance compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

This model is specifically designed for drone-based thermal inspections of PV systems, addressing the unique challenges of detecting small and subtle thermal anomalies, such as hotspots and defective modules, while maintaining real-time performance. Experimental results demonstrate a mean average precision of 90.8%, reflecting a significant improvement over baseline object detection models. With a reduced computational load and robustness under diverse environmental conditions, HOTSPOT-YOLO offers a scalable and reliable solution for large-scale PV inspections. This work highlights the integration of advanced AI techniques with practical engineering applications, revolutionizing automated fault detection in renewable energy systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[VFM-Guided Semi-Supervised Detection Transformer under Source-Free Constraints for Remote Sensing Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11167v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection (SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner, leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed, which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in source-free remote sensing detection tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to IEEE TCSVT</p></details> |

In this work, we advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy. Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models under real-world waste sorting conditions.

Performance Disparities in Underwater Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18729v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules. We publicly release our code and datasets.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Nonetheless, their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge. Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs.

However, these methods suffer from performance degradation in adverse weather conditions. The weather-robust 4D radar provides Doppler and additional geometric information, raising the possibility of addressing this challenge. To this end, we present V2X-R, the first simulated V2X dataset incorporating LiDAR, camera, and 4D radar. V2X-R contains 12,079 scenarios with 37,727 frames of LiDAR and 4D radar point clouds, 150,908 images, and 170,859 annotated 3D vehicle bounding boxes. Subsequently, we propose a novel cooperative LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline for 3D object detection and implement it with various fusion strategies. To achieve weather-robust detection, we additionally propose a Multi-modal Denoising Diffusion (MDD) module in our fusion pipeline. MDD utilizes weather-robust 4D radar feature as a condition to prompt the diffusion model to denoise noisy LiDAR features. Experiments show that our LiDAR-4D radar fusion pipeline demonstrates superior performance in the V2X-R dataset. Over and above this, our MDD module further improved the performance of basic fusion model by up to 5.73%/6.70% in foggy/snowy conditions with barely disrupting normal performance. The dataset and code will be publicly available at: https://github.com/ylwhxht/V2X-R.</p></details> | Accepted by CVPR2025 |
| **[Enhanced Drift-Aware Computer Vision Architecture for Autonomous Driving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17975v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of computer vision in automotive is a trending research in which safety and security are a primary concern. In particular, for autonomous driving, preventing road accidents requires highly accurate object detection under diverse conditions. To address this issue, recently the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released the 8800 norm, providing structured frameworks for managing associated AI relevant risks. However, challenging scenarios such as adverse weather or low lighting often introduce data drift, leading to degraded model performance and potential safety violations. In this work, we present a novel hybrid computer vision architecture trained with thousands of synthetic image data from the road environment to improve robustness in unseen drifted environments. Our dual mode framework utilized YOLO version 8 for swift detection and incorporated a five-layer CNN for verification. The system functioned in sequence and improved the detection accuracy by more than 90\% when tested with drift-augmented road images. The focus was to demonstrate how such a hybrid model can provide better road safety when working together in a hybrid structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Detect Label Errors by Making Them: A Method for Segmentation and Object Detection Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17930v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real label error detection in Cityscapes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Box-Level Class-Balanced Sampling for Active Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17849v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training deep object detectors demands expensive bounding box annotation. Active learning (AL) is a promising technique to alleviate the annotation burden. Performing AL at box-level for object detection, i.e., selecting the most informative boxes to label and supplementing the sparsely-labelled image with pseudo labels, has been shown to be more cost-effective than selecting and labelling the entire image. In box-level AL for object detection, we observe that models at early stage can only perform well on majority classes, making the pseudo labels severely class-imbalanced. We propose a class-balanced sampling strategy to select more objects from minority classes for labelling, so as to make the final training data, \ie, ground truth labels obtained by AL and pseudo labels, more class-balanced to train a better model. We also propose a task-aware soft pseudo labelling strategy to increase the accuracy of pseudo labels. We evaluate our method on public benchmarking datasets and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | Accepted to ICIP2024 |
| **[SCOUT: Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive Data Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17843v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The difficulty of pixel-level annotation has significantly hindered the development of the Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) field. To save on annotation costs, previous works leverage the semi-supervised COD framework that relies on a small number of labeled data and a large volume of unlabeled data. We argue that there is still significant room for improvement in the effective utilization of unlabeled data. To this end, we introduce a Semi-supervised Camouflaged Object Detection by Utilizing Text and Adaptive Data Selection (SCOUT). It includes an Adaptive Data Augment and Selection (ADAS) module and a Text Fusion Module (TFM). The ADSA module selects valuable data for annotation through an adversarial augment and sampling strategy. The TFM module further leverages the selected valuable data by combining camouflage-related knowledge and text-visual interaction. To adapt to this work, we build a new dataset, namely RefTextCOD. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method surpasses previous semi-supervised methods in the COD field and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Recent works introduce self-supervised cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) as a way to transfer these powerful generalization capabilities into 3D LiDAR-based models. However, they either rely on highly complex distillation losses, pseudo-semantic maps, or limit KD to features useful for semantic segmentation only. In this work, we propose CleverDistiller, a self-supervised, cross-modal 2D-to-3D KD framework introducing a set of simple yet effective design choices: Unlike contrastive approaches relying on complex loss design choices, our method employs a direct feature similarity loss in combination with a multi layer perceptron (MLP) projection head to allow the 3D network to learn complex semantic dependencies throughout the projection. Crucially, our approach does not depend on pseudo-semantic maps, allowing for direct knowledge transfer from a VFM without explicit semantic supervision. Additionally, we introduce the auxiliary self-supervised spatial task of occupancy prediction to enhance the semantic knowledge, obtained from a VFM through KD, with 3D spatial reasoning capabilities. Experiments on standard autonomous driving benchmarks for 2D-to-3D KD demonstrate that CleverDistiller achieves state-of-the-art performance in both semantic segmentation and 3D object detection (3DOD) by up to 10% mIoU, especially when fine tuning on really low data amounts, showing the effectiveness of our simple yet powerful KD strategy</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to BMVC 2025</p></details> |
| **[CubeDN: Real-time Drone Detection in 3D Space from Dual mmWave Radar Cubes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17831v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As drone use has become more widespread, there is a critical need to ensure safety and security. A key element of this is robust and accurate drone detection and localization. While cameras and other optical sensors like LiDAR are commonly used for object detection, their performance degrades under adverse lighting and environmental conditions. Therefore, this has generated interest in finding more reliable alternatives, such as millimeter-wave (mmWave) radar. Recent research on mmWave radar object detection has predominantly focused on 2D detection of road users. Although these systems demonstrate excellent performance for 2D problems, they lack the sensing capability to measure elevation, which is essential for 3D drone detection. To address this gap, we propose CubeDN, a single-stage end-to-end radar object detection network specifically designed for flying drones. CubeDN overcomes challenges such as poor elevation resolution by utilizing a dual radar configuration and a novel deep learning pipeline. It simultaneously detects, localizes, and classifies drones of two sizes, achieving decimeter-level tracking accuracy at closer ranges with overall $95\%$ average precision (AP) and $85\%$ average recall (AR). Furthermore, CubeDN completes data processing and inference at 10Hz, making it highly suitable for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their advantages, synthetic event-based vision remains largely unexplored in mainstream robotics simulators. This lack of simulation setup hinders the evaluation of event-driven approaches for robotic manipulation and navigation tasks. This work presents an open-source, user-friendly v2e robotics operating system (ROS) package for Gazebo simulation that enables seamless event stream generation from RGB camera feeds. The package is used to investigate event-based robotic policies (ERP) for real-time navigation and manipulation. Two representative scenarios are evaluated: (1) object following with a mobile robot and (2) object detection and grasping with a robotic manipulator. Transformer-based ERPs are trained by behavior cloning and compared to RGB-based counterparts under various operating conditions. Experimental results show that event-guided policies consistently deliver competitive advantages. The results highlight the potential of event-driven perception to improve real-time robotic navigation and manipulation, providing a foundation for broader integration of event cameras into robotic policy learning.

The practical and economic barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines procedural rendering with AI-driven video generation. Our methodology leverages BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2 world-foundation model to synthesize physically plausible video sequences with temporal diversity, capturing rare viewpoints and adverse conditions. We demonstrate that a YOLO-based detection network trained on a composite dataset, blending real images with our synthetic data, achieves superior performance compared to models trained exclusively on real-world data. Notably, a 1:1 mixture of real and synthetic data yielded the highest accuracy, surpassing the real-only baseline. These findings highlight the viability of a synthetic-first approach as an efficient, cost-effective, and safe alternative for developing reliable perception systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained industrial applications.</p></details> |  |

However, existing researches have been conducted on limited datasets, where the training and testing sets share the same distribution. In this paper, we consider the task of adapting indoor 3D object detectors from one dataset to another, presenting a comprehensive benchmark with ScanNet, SUN RGB-D and 3D Front datasets, as well as our newly proposed large-scale datasets ProcTHOR-OD and ProcFront generated by a 3D simulator. Since indoor point cloud datasets are collected and constructed in different ways, the object detectors are likely to overfit to specific factors within each dataset, such as point cloud quality, bounding box layout and instance features. We conduct experiments across datasets on different adaptation scenarios including synthetic-to-real adaptation, point cloud quality adaptation, layout adaptation and instance feature adaptation, analyzing the impact of different domain gaps on 3D object detectors. We also introduce several approaches to improve adaptation performances, providing baselines for domain adaptive indoor 3D object detection, hoping that future works may propose detectors with stronger generalization ability across domains.

Existing detection methods, whether offline or online, typically rely on dense point cloud reconstruction, which imposes substantial computational overhead and memory constraints, hindering real-time deployment in downstream tasks. To address this, we propose a novel reconstruction-free online framework tailored for memory-efficient and real-time 3D detection. Specifically, given streaming posed RGB-D video input, we leverage Cubify Anything as a pre-trained visual foundation model (VFM) for single-view 3D object detection by bounding boxes, coupled with CLIP to capture open-vocabulary semantics of detected objects. To fuse all detected bounding boxes across different views into a unified one, we employ an association module for correspondences of multi-views and an optimization module to fuse the 3D bounding boxes of the same instance predicted in multi-views. The association module utilizes 3D Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) and a box correspondence matching module, while the optimization module uses an IoU-guided efficient random optimization technique based on particle filtering to enforce multi-view consistency of the 3D bounding boxes while minimizing computational complexity. Extensive experiments on ScanNetV2 and CA-1M datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance among online methods. Benefiting from this novel reconstruction-free paradigm for 3D object detection, our method exhibits great generalization abilities in various scenarios, enabling real-time perception even in environments exceeding 1000 square meters.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lanlan96.github.io/BoxFusion/</p></details> |

Existing sampling-based rebalancing strategies, such as Repeat Factor Sampling (RFS) and Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (IRFS), mitigate this issue by adjusting sample frequencies based on image and instance counts. However, these methods are based on linear adjustments, which limit their effectiveness in long-tailed distributions. This work introduces Exponentially Weighted Instance-Aware Repeat Factor Sampling (E-IRFS), an extension of IRFS that applies exponential scaling to better differentiate between rare and frequent classes. E-IRFS adjusts sampling probabilities using an exponential function applied to the geometric mean of image and instance frequencies, ensuring a more adaptive rebalancing strategy. We evaluate E-IRFS on a dataset derived from the Fireman-UAV-RGBT Dataset and four additional public datasets, using YOLOv11 object detection models to identify fire, smoke, people and lakes in emergency scenarios. The results show that E-IRFS improves detection performance by 22\% over the baseline and outperforms RFS and IRFS, particularly for rare categories. The analysis also highlights that E-IRFS has a stronger effect on lightweight models with limited capacity, as these models rely more on data sampling strategies to address class imbalance. The findings demonstrate that E-IRFS improves rare object detection in resource-constrained environments, making it a suitable solution for real-time applications such as UAV-based emergency monitoring.

However, SEWs face inherent limitations in computational power, memory, and battery life, while offloading computations to external servers is constrained by network conditions and server workload variability. To address these challenges, we propose a Federated Reinforcement Learning (FRL) framework, enabling multiple agents to train collaboratively while preserving data privacy. We implemented synchronous and asynchronous federation strategies, where models are aggregated either at fixed intervals or dynamically based on agent progress. Experimental results show that federated agents exhibit significantly lower performance variability, ensuring greater stability and reliability. These findings underscore the potential of FRL for applications requiring robust real-time AI processing, such as real-time object detection in SEWs.</p></details> |  |

We propose OVODA, a novel framework enabling both open-vocabulary 3D object and attribute detection with no need to know the novel class anchor size. OVODA uses foundation models to bridge the semantic gap between 3D features and texts while jointly detecting attributes, e.g., spatial relationships, motion states, etc. To facilitate such research direction, we propose OVAD, a new dataset that supplements existing 3D object detection benchmarks with comprehensive attribute annotations. OVODA incorporates several key innovations, including foundation model feature concatenation, prompt tuning strategies, and specialized techniques for attribute detection, including perspective-specified prompts and horizontal flip augmentation. Our results on both the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets show that under the condition of no given anchor sizes of novel classes, OVODA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in open-vocabulary 3D object detection while successfully recognizing object attributes.

Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled, high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances and challenging foggy scenes.

| **[Towards Training-Free Underwater 3D Object Detection from Sonar Point Clouds: A Comparison of Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18293v1)** | 2025-08-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift. Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments where traditional machine learning approaches fail.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, submitted to IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering (IEEE-JOE)</p></details> |

VFMs are capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5, AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications. These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification, autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts, noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.</p></details> |  |

| **[SocialTrack: Multi-Object Tracking in Complex Urban Traffic Scenes Inspired by Social Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12777v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a key research direction in the field of multi-object tracking (MOT), UAV-based multi-object tracking has significant application value in the analysis and understanding of urban intelligent transportation systems. However, in complex UAV perspectives, challenges such as small target scale variations, occlusions, nonlinear crossing motions, and motion blur severely hinder the stability of multi-object tracking. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel multi-object tracking framework, SocialTrack, aimed at enhancing the tracking accuracy and robustness of small targets in complex urban traffic environments. The specialized small-target detector enhances the detection performance by employing a multi-scale feature enhancement mechanism. The Velocity Adaptive Cubature Kalman Filter (VACKF) improves the accuracy of trajectory prediction by incorporating a velocity dynamic modeling mechanism. The Group Motion Compensation Strategy (GMCS) models social group motion priors to provide stable state update references for low-quality tracks, significantly improving the target association accuracy in complex dynamic environments. Furthermore, the Spatio-Temporal Memory Prediction (STMP) leverages historical trajectory information to predict the future state of low-quality tracks, effectively mitigating identity switching issues. Extensive experiments on the UAVDT and MOT17 datasets demonstrate that SocialTrack outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across several key metrics. Significant improvements in MOTA and IDF1, among other core performance indicators, highlight its superior robustness and adaptability. Additionally, SocialTrack is highly modular and compatible, allowing for seamless integration with existing trackers to further enhance performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

However, existing datasets and methodologies primarily target mainstream team sports such as soccer and conventional 5-on-5 basketball, often overlooking scenarios involving fixed-camera setups commonly used at amateur levels, less mainstream sports, or datasets that explicitly incorporate pose annotations. In this paper, we propose the TrackID3x3 dataset, the first publicly available comprehensive dataset specifically designed for multi-player tracking, player identification, and pose estimation in 3x3 basketball scenarios. The dataset comprises three distinct subsets (Indoor fixed-camera, Outdoor fixed-camera, and Drone camera footage), capturing diverse full-court camera perspectives and environments. We also introduce the Track-ID task, a simplified variant of the game state reconstruction task that excludes field detection and focuses exclusively on fixed-camera scenarios. To evaluate performance, we propose a baseline algorithm called Track-ID algorithm, tailored to assess tracking and identification quality. Furthermore, our benchmark experiments, utilizing recent multi-object tracking algorithms (e.g., BoT-SORT-ReID) and top-down pose estimation methods (HRNet, RTMPose, and SwinPose), demonstrate robust results and highlight remaining challenges. Our dataset and evaluation benchmarks provide a solid foundation for advancing automated analytics in 3x3 basketball.

However, this aspect of the problem is mostly overlooked or mitigated by employing two-stage association and utilizing low confidence detections in the second stage. Recently proposed BoostTrack attempts to avoid the drawbacks of multiple stage association approach and use low-confidence detections by applying detection confidence boosting. In this paper, we identify the limitations of the confidence boost used in BoostTrack and propose a method to improve its performance. To construct a richer similarity measure and enable a better selection of true positive detections, we propose to use a combination of shape, Mahalanobis distance and novel soft BIoU similarity. We propose a soft detection confidence boost technique which calculates new confidence scores based on the similarity measure and the previous confidence scores, and we introduce varying similarity threshold to account for lower similarity measure between detections and tracklets which are not regularly updated. The proposed additions are mutually independent and can be used in any MOT algorithm. Combined with the BoostTrack+ baseline, our method achieves near state of the art results on the MOT17 dataset and new state of the art HOTA and IDF1 scores on the MOT20 dataset. The source code is available at: https://github.com/vukasin-stanojevic/BoostTrack .</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Filomat, Vol 39, No 16 (2025)</p></details> |
| **[6-DoF Object Tracking with Event-based Optical Flow and Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14776v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tracking the position and orientation of objects in space (i.e., in 6-DoF) in real time is a fundamental problem in robotics for environment interaction. It becomes more challenging when objects move at high-speed due to frame rate limitations in conventional cameras and motion blur. Event cameras are characterized by high temporal resolution, low latency and high dynamic range, that can potentially overcome the impacts of motion blur. Traditional RGB cameras provide rich visual information that is more suitable for the challenging task of single-shot object pose estimation. In this work, we propose using event-based optical flow combined with an RGB based global object pose estimator for 6-DoF pose tracking of objects at high-speed, exploiting the core advantages of both types of vision sensors. Specifically, we propose an event-based optical flow algorithm for object motion measurement to implement an object 6-DoF velocity tracker. By integrating the tracked object 6-DoF velocity with low frequency estimated pose from the global pose estimator, the method can track pose when objects move at high-speed. The proposed algorithm is tested and validated on both synthetic and real world data, demonstrating its effectiveness, especially in high-speed motion scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[SMTrack: End-to-End Trained Spiking Neural Networks for Multi-Object Tracking in RGB Videos](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14607v1)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brain-inspired Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential for low-power computation, yet their application in visual tasks remains largely confined to image classification, object detection, and event-based tracking. In contrast, real-world vision systems still widely use conventional RGB video streams, where the potential of directly-trained SNNs for complex temporal tasks such as multi-object tracking (MOT) remains underexplored. To address this challenge, we propose SMTrack-the first directly trained deep SNN framework for end-to-end multi-object tracking on standard RGB videos. SMTrack introduces an adaptive and scale-aware Normalized Wasserstein Distance loss (Asa-NWDLoss) to improve detection and localization performance under varying object scales and densities. Specifically, the method computes the average object size within each training batch and dynamically adjusts the normalization factor, thereby enhancing sensitivity to small objects. For the association stage, we incorporate the TrackTrack identity module to maintain robust and consistent object trajectories. Extensive evaluations on BEE24, MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack show that SMTrack achieves performance on par with leading ANN-based MOT methods, advancing robust and accurate SNN-based tracking in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Token-based Object Detection with Video](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22562v2)** | 2025-08-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper improves upon the Pix2Seq object detector by extending it for videos. In the process, it introduces a new way to perform end-to-end video object detection that improves upon existing video detectors in two key ways. First, by representing objects as variable-length sequences of discrete tokens, we can succinctly represent widely varying numbers of video objects, with diverse shapes and locations, without having to inject any localization cues in the training process. This eliminates the need to sample the space of all possible boxes that constrains conventional detectors and thus solves the dual problems of loss sparsity during training and heuristics-based postprocessing during inference. Second, it conceptualizes and outputs the video objects as fully integrated and indivisible 3D boxes or tracklets instead of generating image-specific 2D boxes and linking these boxes together to construct the video object, as done in most conventional detectors. This allows it to scale effortlessly with available computational resources by simply increasing the length of the video subsequence that the network takes as input, even generalizing to multi-object tracking if the subsequence can span the entire video. We compare our video detector with the baseline Pix2Seq static detector on several datasets and demonstrate consistent improvement, although with strong signs of being bottlenecked by our limited computational resources. We also compare it with several video detectors on UA-DETRAC to show that it is competitive with the current state of the art even with the computational bottleneck. We make our code and models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE Access</p></details> |

The state-of-the-art approaches usually employ a tracking-by-detection method, and data association plays a critical role. This paper proposes a learning and graph-optimized (LEGO) modular tracker to improve data association performance in the existing literature. The proposed LEGO tracker integrates graph optimization and self-attention mechanisms, which efficiently formulate the association score map, facilitating the accurate and efficient matching of objects across time frames. To further enhance the state update process, the Kalman filter is added to ensure consistent tracking by incorporating temporal coherence in the object states. Our proposed method utilizing LiDAR alone has shown exceptional performance compared to other online tracking approaches, including LiDAR-based and LiDAR-camera fusion-based methods. LEGO ranked 1st at the time of submitting results to KITTI object tracking evaluation ranking board and remains 2nd at the time of submitting this paper, among all online trackers in the KITTI MOT benchmark for cars1</p></details> |  |

The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to FUSION 2025 conference</p></details> |

Despite doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles, previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format of the fast racket sport.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Omni Survey for Multimodality Analysis in Visual Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13000v1)** | 2025-08-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of smart cities has led to the generation of massive amounts of multi-modal data in the context of a range of tasks that enable a comprehensive monitoring of the smart city infrastructure and services. This paper surveys one of the most critical tasks, multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT), from the perspective of multimodality analysis. Generally, MMVOT differs from single-modal tracking in four key aspects, data collection, modality alignment and annotation, model designing, and evaluation. Accordingly, we begin with an introduction to the relevant data modalities, laying the groundwork for their integration. This naturally leads to a discussion of challenges of multi-modal data collection, alignment, and annotation. Subsequently, existing MMVOT methods are categorised, based on different ways to deal with visible (RGB) and X modalities: programming the auxiliary X branch with replicated or non-replicated experimental configurations from the RGB branch. Here X can be thermal infrared (T), depth (D), event (E), near infrared (NIR), language (L), or sonar (S). The final part of the paper addresses evaluation and benchmarking. In summary, we undertake an omni survey of all aspects of multi-modal visual object tracking (VOT), covering six MMVOT tasks and featuring 338 references in total. In addition, we discuss the fundamental rhetorical question: Is multi-modal tracking always guaranteed to provide a superior solution to unimodal tracking with the help of information fusion, and if not, in what circumstances its application is beneficial. Furthermore, for the first time in this field, we analyse the distributions of the object categories in the existing MMVOT datasets, revealing their pronounced long-tail nature and a noticeable lack of animal categories when compared with RGB datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The first comprehensive survey for multi-modal visual object tracking; 6 multi-modal tasks; 338 references</p></details> |

It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity. Key properties of the functional derivative are revealed and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

However, this efficiency often compromises the expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG) and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD) design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.</p></details> |  |
| **[Delving into Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency for Robust 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11323v1)** | 2025-08-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serial Over Parallel: Learning Continual Unification for Multi-Modal Visual Object Tracking and Benchmarking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10655v1)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unifying multiple multi-modal visual object tracking (MMVOT) tasks draws increasing attention due to the complementary nature of different modalities in building robust tracking systems. Existing practices mix all data sensor types in a single training procedure, structuring a parallel paradigm from the data-centric perspective and aiming for a global optimum on the joint distribution of the involved tasks. However, the absence of a unified benchmark where all types of data coexist forces evaluations on separated benchmarks, causing \textit{inconsistency} between training and testing, thus leading to performance \textit{degradation}. To address these issues, this work advances in two aspects: \ding{182} A unified benchmark, coined as UniBench300, is introduced to bridge the inconsistency by incorporating multiple task data, reducing inference passes from three to one and cutting time consumption by 27\%. \ding{183} The unification process is reformulated in a serial format, progressively integrating new tasks. In this way, the performance degradation can be specified as knowledge forgetting of previous tasks, which naturally aligns with the philosophy of continual learning (CL), motivating further exploration of injecting CL into the unification process. Extensive experiments conducted on two baselines and four benchmarks demonstrate the significance of UniBench300 and the superiority of CL in supporting a stable unification process. Moreover, while conducting dedicated analyses, the performance degradation is found to be negatively correlated with network capacity. Additionally, modality discrepancies contribute to varying degradation levels across tasks (RGBT > RGBD > RGBE in MMVOT), offering valuable insights for future multi-modal vision research. Source codes and the proposed benchmark is available at \textit{https://github.com/Zhangyong-Tang/UniBench300}.</p></details> | ACMMM 2025 |

However, vision-based approaches face fundamental limitations in adverse weather conditions, partial occlusions, and precise velocity estimation - critical challenges in safety-sensitive scenarios where accurate motion understanding and long-horizon trajectory prediction are essential for collision avoidance. To address these limitations, we propose SpaRC-AD, a query-based end-to-end camera-radar fusion framework for planning-oriented autonomous driving. Through sparse 3D feature alignment, and doppler-based velocity estimation, we achieve strong 3D scene representations for refinement of agent anchors, map polylines and motion modelling. Our method achieves strong improvements over the state-of-the-art vision-only baselines across multiple autonomous driving tasks, including 3D detection (+4.8% mAP), multi-object tracking (+8.3% AMOTA), online mapping (+1.8% mAP), motion prediction (-4.0% mADE), and trajectory planning (-0.1m L2 and -9% TPC). We achieve both spatial coherence and temporal consistency on multiple challenging benchmarks, including real-world open-loop nuScenes, long-horizon T-nuScenes, and closed-loop simulator Bench2Drive.

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |

Through controlled Online Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements (AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual SLAMMOT Considering Multiple Motion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19134v2)** | 2025-08-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) and Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) are pivotal tasks in the realm of autonomous driving, attracting considerable research attention. While SLAM endeavors to generate real-time maps and determine the vehicle's pose in unfamiliar settings, MOT focuses on the real-time identification and tracking of multiple dynamic objects. Despite their importance, the prevalent approach treats SLAM and MOT as independent modules within an autonomous vehicle system, leading to inherent limitations. Classical SLAM methodologies often rely on a static environment assumption, suitable for indoor rather than dynamic outdoor scenarios. Conversely, conventional MOT techniques typically rely on the vehicle's known state, constraining the accuracy of object state estimations based on this prior. To address these challenges, previous efforts introduced the unified SLAMMOT paradigm, yet primarily focused on simplistic motion patterns. In our team's previous work IMM-SLAMMOT\cite{IMM-SLAMMOT}, we present a novel methodology incorporating consideration of multiple motion models into SLAMMOT i.e. tightly coupled SLAM and MOT, demonstrating its efficacy in LiDAR-based systems. This paper studies feasibility and advantages of instantiating this methodology as visual SLAMMOT, bridging the gap between LiDAR and vision-based sensing mechanisms. Specifically, we propose a solution of visual SLAMMOT considering multiple motion models and validate the inherent advantages of IMM-SLAMMOT in the visual domain.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress, the intrinsic relationship between the two subtasks of tracking and referring in RMOT has not been fully studied. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of their interdependence, revealing that current two-stage Referring-by-Tracking (RBT) frameworks remain fundamentally limited by insufficient modeling of subtask interactions and inflexible reliance on semantic alignment modules like CLIP. To this end, we propose JustHook, a novel two-stage RBT framework where a Hook module is firstly designed to redefine the linkage between subtasks. The Hook is built centered on grid sampling at the feature-level and is used for context-aware target feature extraction. Moreover, we propose a Parallel Combined Decoder (PCD) that learns in a unified joint feature space rather than relying on pre-defined cross-modal embeddings. Our design not only enhances the interpretability and modularity but also significantly improves the generalization. Extensive experiments on Refer-KITTI, Refer-KITTI-V2, and Refer-Dance demonstrate that JustHook achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving the HOTA by +6.9\% on Refer-KITTI-V2 with superior efficiency. Code will be available soon.</p></details> |  |

We present STAC, a cross-cameras surveillance system that leverages spatio-temporal associations for efficient object tracking under constrained network conditions. STAC integrates multi-resolution feature learning, ensuring robustness under variable networked system level optimizations such as frame filtering, FFmpeg-based compression, and Region-of-Interest (RoI) masking, to eliminate redundant content across distributed video streams while preserving downstream model accuracy for object identification and tracking. Evaluated on NVIDIA's AICity Challenge dataset, STAC achieves a 76\% improvement in tracking accuracy and an 8.6x reduction in inference latency over a standard multi-object multi-camera tracking baseline (using YOLOv4 and DeepSORT). Furthermore, 29\% of redundant frames are filtered, significantly reducing data volume without compromising inference quality.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a novel model, DRWKV (Detailed Receptance Weighted Key Value), which integrates our proposed Global Edge Retinex (GER) theory, enabling effective decoupling of illumination and edge structures for enhanced edge fidelity. Secondly, we introduce Evolving WKV Attention, a spiral-scanning mechanism that captures spatial edge continuity and models irregular structures more effectively. Thirdly, we design the Bilateral Spectrum Aligner (Bi-SAB) and a tailored MS2-Loss to jointly align luminance and chrominance features, improving visual naturalness and mitigating artifacts. Extensive experiments on five LLIE benchmarks demonstrate that DRWKV achieves leading performance in PSNR, SSIM, and NIQE while maintaining low computational complexity. Furthermore, DRWKV enhances downstream performance in low-light multi-object tracking tasks, validating its generalization capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[MeMoSORT: Memory-Assisted Filtering and Motion-Adaptive Association Metric for Multi-Person Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09796v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter (MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU (Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of 67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Offline Auto Labeling: BAAS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09585v1)** | 2025-08-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous driving. Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic objects and class types</p></details> |  |
| **[SAGOnline: Segment Any Gaussians Online](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08219v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for explicit 3D scene representation, yet achieving efficient and consistent 3D segmentation remains challenging. Current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs, limited 3D spatial reasoning, and an inability to track multiple objects simultaneously. We present Segment Any Gaussians Online (SAGOnline), a lightweight and zero-shot framework for real-time 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes that addresses these limitations through two key innovations: (1) a decoupled strategy that integrates video foundation models (e.g., SAM2) for view-consistent 2D mask propagation across synthesized views; and (2) a GPU-accelerated 3D mask generation and Gaussian-level instance labeling algorithm that assigns unique identifiers to 3D primitives, enabling lossless multi-object tracking and segmentation across views. SAGOnline achieves state-of-the-art performance on NVOS (92.7% mIoU) and Spin-NeRF (95.2% mIoU) benchmarks, outperforming Feature3DGS, OmniSeg3D-gs, and SA3D by 15--1500 times in inference speed (27 ms/frame). Qualitative results demonstrate robust multi-object segmentation and tracking in complex scenes. Our contributions include: (i) a lightweight and zero-shot framework for 3D segmentation in Gaussian scenes, (ii) explicit labeling of Gaussian primitives enabling simultaneous segmentation and tracking, and (iii) the effective adaptation of 2D video foundation models to the 3D domain. This work allows real-time rendering and 3D scene understanding, paving the way for practical AR/VR and robotic applications.</p></details> | 19 pages, 10 figures |
| **[GRASPTrack: Geometry-Reasoned Association via Segmentation and Projection for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08117v1)** | 2025-08-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) in monocular videos is fundamentally challenged by occlusions and depth ambiguity, issues that conventional tracking-by-detection (TBD) methods struggle to resolve owing to a lack of geometric awareness. To address these limitations, we introduce GRASPTrack, a novel depth-aware MOT framework that integrates monocular depth estimation and instance segmentation into a standard TBD pipeline to generate high-fidelity 3D point clouds from 2D detections, thereby enabling explicit 3D geometric reasoning. These 3D point clouds are then voxelized to enable a precise and robust Voxel-Based 3D Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for spatial association. To further enhance tracking robustness, our approach incorporates Depth-aware Adaptive Noise Compensation, which dynamically adjusts the Kalman filter process noise based on occlusion severity for more reliable state estimation. Additionally, we propose a Depth-enhanced Observation-Centric Momentum, which extends the motion direction consistency from the image plane into 3D space to improve motion-based association cues, particularly for objects with complex trajectories. Extensive experiments on the MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance, significantly improving tracking robustness in complex scenes with frequent occlusions and intricate motion patterns.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present Multiple Fish Tracking Dataset 2025 (MFT25), a comprehensive dataset specifically designed for underwater multiple fish tracking, featuring 15 diverse video sequences with 408,578 meticulously annotated bounding boxes across 48,066 frames. Our dataset captures various underwater environments, fish species, and challenging conditions including occlusions, similar appearances, and erratic motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce Scale-aware and Unscented Tracker (SU-T), a specialized tracking framework featuring an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) optimized for non-linear swimming patterns of fish and a novel Fish-Intersection-over-Union (FishIoU) matching that accounts for the unique morphological characteristics of aquatic species. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our SU-T baseline achieves state-of-the-art performance on MFT25, with 34.1 HOTA and 44.6 IDF1, while revealing fundamental differences between fish tracking and terrestrial object tracking scenarios.

| **[SUIT: Spatial-Spectral Union-Intersection Interaction Network for Hyperspectral Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07250v1)** | 2025-08-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral videos (HSVs), with their inherent spatial-spectral-temporal structure, offer distinct advantages in challenging tracking scenarios such as cluttered backgrounds and small objects. However, existing methods primarily focus on spatial interactions between the template and search regions, often overlooking spectral interactions, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates spectral interactions from both the architectural and training perspectives. At the architectural level, we first establish band-wise long-range spatial relationships between the template and search regions using Transformers. We then model spectral interactions using the inclusion-exclusion principle from set theory, treating them as the union of spatial interactions across all bands. This enables the effective integration of both shared and band-specific spatial cues. At the training level, we introduce a spectral loss to enforce material distribution alignment between the template and predicted regions, enhancing robustness to shape deformation and appearance variations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our tracker achieves state-of-the-art tracking performance. The source code, trained models and results will be publicly available via https://github.com/bearshng/suit to support reproducibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Street Gaussians without 3D Object Tracker](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05548v3)** | 2025-08-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic scene reconstruction in driving scenarios poses significant challenges due to fast-moving objects. Most existing methods rely on labor-intensive manual labeling of object poses to reconstruct dynamic objects in canonical space and move them based on these poses during rendering. While some approaches attempt to use 3D object trackers to replace manual annotations, the limited generalization of 3D trackers -- caused by the scarcity of large-scale 3D datasets -- results in inferior reconstructions in real-world settings. In contrast, 2D foundation models demonstrate strong generalization capabilities. To eliminate the reliance on 3D trackers and enhance robustness across diverse environments, we propose a stable object tracking module by leveraging associations from 2D deep trackers within a 3D object fusion strategy. We address inevitable tracking errors by further introducing a motion learning strategy in an implicit feature space that autonomously corrects trajectory errors and recovers missed detections. Experimental results on Waymo-NOTR and KITTI show that our method outperforms existing approaches. Our code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |

Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on existing benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To advance VOS toward more realistic environments, coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the strengths and limitations of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and over 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces significantly greater scene complexity, including more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), scenarios requiring external knowledge, etc. We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and find similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 presents challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite high accuracy on existing datasets, current VOS methods still struggle under real-world complexities. MOSEv2 is publicly available at https://MOSE.video.</p></details> | <details><summary>MOSEv...</summary><p>MOSEv2 Dataset Report, Project Page: https://mose.video/</p></details> |

Despite advances in vision and language models, this task remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model, allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh. Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing approaches.

| **[Composition and Alignment of Diffusion Models using Constrained Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19104v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at https://github.com/shervinkhalafi/constrained_comp_align.</p></details> |  |
| **[ForgetMe: Evaluating Selective Forgetting in Generative Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12574v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread adoption of diffusion models in image generation has increased the demand for privacy-compliant unlearning. However, due to the high-dimensional nature and complex feature representations of diffusion models, achieving selective unlearning remains challenging, as existing methods struggle to remove sensitive information while preserving the consistency of non-sensitive regions. To address this, we propose an Automatic Dataset Creation Framework based on prompt-based layered editing and training-free local feature removal, constructing the ForgetMe dataset and introducing the Entangled evaluation metric. The Entangled metric quantifies unlearning effectiveness by assessing the similarity and consistency between the target and background regions and supports both paired (Entangled-D) and unpaired (Entangled-S) image data, enabling unsupervised evaluation. The ForgetMe dataset encompasses a diverse set of real and synthetic scenarios, including CUB-200-2011 (Birds), Stanford-Dogs, ImageNet, and a synthetic cat dataset. We apply LoRA fine-tuning on Stable Diffusion to achieve selective unlearning on this dataset and validate the effectiveness of both the ForgetMe dataset and the Entangled metric, establishing them as benchmarks for selective unlearning. Our work provides a scalable and adaptable solution for advancing privacy-preserving generative AI.</p></details> |  |

However, current image generative frameworks predominantly rely on single-source inputs -- either text prompts or individual reference images. In this paper, we focus on the task of controllable image generation using multiple visual references. We introduce MultiRef-bench, a rigorous evaluation framework comprising 990 synthetic and 1,000 real-world samples that require incorporating visual content from multiple reference images. The synthetic samples are synthetically generated through our data engine RefBlend, with 10 reference types and 33 reference combinations. Based on RefBlend, we further construct a dataset MultiRef containing 38k high-quality images to facilitate further research. Our experiments across three interleaved image-text models (i.e., OmniGen, ACE, and Show-o) and six agentic frameworks (e.g., ChatDiT and LLM + SD) reveal that even state-of-the-art systems struggle with multi-reference conditioning, with the best model OmniGen achieving only 66.6% in synthetic samples and 79.0% in real-world cases on average compared to the golden answer. These findings provide valuable directions for developing more flexible and human-like creative tools that can effectively integrate multiple sources of visual inspiration.

| **[Prototype-Guided Diffusion: Visual Conditioning without External Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09922v4)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning - without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns, enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based conditioning in diffusion models.</p></details> |  |

Fractals show self-similarity across sizes; structures that resemble the entire are revealed when zoomed in. In Quantum systems, the probability density or wavefunction may exhibit recurring interference patterns at various energy or length scales. Fractals are produced by basic iterative rules (such as Mandelbrot or Julia sets), and they provide limitless complexity. Despite its simplicity, the Schr\"odinger equation in quantum mechanics produces incredibly intricate patterns of interference and entanglement, particularly in chaotic quantum systems. Quantum computing, the root where lies to the using the principles of quantum-mechanical phenomenon, when applied in fractal image generation, what outcomes are expected? The paper outlines the generation of a Julia set dataset using an approach coupled with building quantum circuit, highlighting the concepts of superposition, randomness, and entanglement as foundational elements to manipulate the generated dataset patterns. As Quantum computing is finding many application areas, the possibility of using quantum circuits for fractal Julia image generation posits a unique direction of future research where it can be applied to quantum generative arts across various ecosystems with a customised approach, such as producing an exciting landscape based on a quantum art theme.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are limited to challenging image-based forecasting, which suffers from redundant information and lacks comprehensive and critical world knowledge, including dynamic, spatial and semantic information. To address these limitations, we propose DreamVLA, a novel VLA framework that integrates comprehensive world knowledge forecasting to enable inverse dynamics modeling, thereby establishing a perception-prediction-action loop for manipulation tasks. Specifically, DreamVLA introduces a dynamic-region-guided world knowledge prediction, integrated with the spatial and semantic cues, which provide compact yet comprehensive representations for action planning. This design aligns with how humans interact with the world by first forming abstract multimodal reasoning chains before acting. To mitigate interference among the dynamic, spatial and semantic information during training, we adopt a block-wise structured attention mechanism that masks their mutual attention, preventing information leakage and keeping each representation clean and disentangled. Moreover, to model the conditional distribution over future actions, we employ a diffusion-based transformer that disentangles action representations from shared latent features. Extensive experiments on both real-world and simulation environments demonstrate that DreamVLA achieves 76.7% success rate on real robot tasks and 4.44 average length on the CALVIN ABC-D benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual-CoG: Stage-Aware Reinforcement Learning with Chain of Guidance for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18032v2)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the promising progress of recent autoregressive models in text-to-image (T2I) generation, their ability to handle multi-attribute and ambiguous prompts remains limited. To address these limitations, existing works have applied chain-of-thought (CoT) to enable stage-aware visual synthesis and employed reinforcement learning (RL) to improve reasoning capabilities. However, most models provide reward signals only at the end of the generation stage. This monolithic final-only guidance makes it difficult to identify which stages contribute positively to the final outcome and may lead to suboptimal policies. To tackle this issue, we propose a Visual-Chain of Guidance (Visual-CoG) paradigm consisting of three stages: semantic reasoning, process refining, and outcome evaluation, with stage-aware rewards providing immediate guidance throughout the image generation pipeline. We further construct a visual cognition benchmark, VisCog-Bench, which comprises four subtasks to evaluate the effectiveness of semantic reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and the proposed VisCog-Bench show improvements of 15%, 5%, and 19%, respectively, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed Visual-CoG. We will release all the resources soon.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1) grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a zero-shot manner.</p></details> |  |
| **[One Framework to Rule Them All: Unifying Multimodal Tasks with LLM Neural-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03001v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale models have exhibited remarkable capabilities across diverse domains, including automated medical services and intelligent customer support. However, as most large models are trained on single-modality corpora, enabling them to effectively process and understand multimodal signals remains a significant challenge. Current research often focuses on designing task-specific or scenario-specific tuning strategies, which limits the scalability and versatility. To address this limitation, we propose a unified framework that concurrently handles multiple tasks and modalities. In this framework, all modalities and tasks are represented as unified tokens and trained using a single, consistent approach. To enable efficient multitask processing, we introduce a novel tuning strategy termed neural tuning, inspired by the concept of sparse distributed representation in the human brain, where only specific subsets of neurons are activated for each task. Furthermore, to advance research in multimodal and multitask learning, we present a new benchmark, MMUD, which includes samples annotated with multiple task labels spanning reasoning segmentation, referring segmentation, image captioning, and text-to-image generation. By applying neural tuning to pretrained large models on the MMUD benchmark, we demonstrate the ability to handle multiple tasks simultaneously in a streamlined and efficient manner. All models, code, and datasets will be released publicly upon publication, fostering further research and innovation in this field.</p></details> |  |

We propose DiffAug a novel framework that combines textguided diffusion-based generation with automatic segmentation validation to address this challenge. Our proposed approach uses latent diffusion models conditioned on medical text descriptions and spatial masks to synthesize abnormalities via inpainting on normal images. Generated samples undergo dynamic quality validation through a latentspace segmentation network that ensures accurate localization while enabling single-step inference. The text prompts, derived from medical literature, guide the generation of diverse abnormality types without requiring manual annotation. Our validation mechanism filters synthetic samples based on spatial accuracy, maintaining quality while operating efficiently through direct latent estimation. Evaluated on three medical imaging benchmarks (CVC-ClinicDB, Kvasir-SEG, REFUGE2), our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance with 8-10% Dice improvements over baselines and reduces false negative rates by up to 28% for challenging cases like small polyps and flat lesions critical for early detection in screening applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CVAMD Workshop at ICCV 2025</p></details> |

To address this, we propose CEIDM, a image generation method based on diffusion model with dual controls for entity and interaction. First, we propose an entity interactive relationships mining approach based on Large Language Models (LLMs), extracting reasonable and rich implicit interactive relationships through chain of thought to guide diffusion models to generate high-quality images that are closer to realistic logic and have more reasonable interactive relationships. Furthermore, We propose an interactive action clustering and offset method to cluster and offset the interactive action features contained in each text prompts. By constructing global and local bidirectional offsets, we enhance semantic understanding and detail supplementation of original actions, making the model's understanding of the concept of interactive "actions" more accurate and generating images with more accurate interactive actions. Finally, we design an entity control network which generates masks with entity semantic guidance, then leveraging multi-scale convolutional network to enhance entity feature and dynamic network to fuse feature. It effectively controls entities and significantly improves image quality.

Previous methods often rely on static, pre-collected preferences or fine-tuning, limiting adaptability to evolving and nuanced user intents. In this paper, we highlight the need for instant preference-aligned T2I generation and propose a training-free framework grounded in multimodal large language model (MLLM) priors. Our framework decouples the task into two components: preference understanding and preference-guided generation. For preference understanding, we leverage MLLMs to automatically extract global preference signals from a reference image and enrich a given prompt using structured instruction design. Our approach supports broader and more fine-grained coverage of user preferences than existing methods. For preference-guided generation, we integrate global keyword-based control and local region-aware cross-attention modulation to steer the diffusion model without additional training, enabling precise alignment across both global attributes and local elements. The entire framework supports multi-round interactive refinement, facilitating real-time and context-aware image generation. Extensive experiments on the Viper dataset and our collected benchmark demonstrate that our method outperforms prior approaches in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations, and opens up new possibilities for dialog-based generation and MLLM-diffusion integration.</p></details> | 17 figures |
| **[Conditional Stochastic Interpolation for Generative Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05579v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a conditional stochastic interpolation (CSI) method for learning conditional distributions. CSI is based on estimating probability flow equations or stochastic differential equations that transport a reference distribution to the target conditional distribution. This is achieved by first learning the conditional drift and score functions based on CSI, which are then used to construct a deterministic process governed by an ordinary differential equation or a diffusion process for conditional sampling. In our proposed approach, we incorporate an adaptive diffusion term to address the instability issues arising in the diffusion process. We derive explicit expressions of the conditional drift and score functions in terms of conditional expectations, which naturally lead to an nonparametric regression approach to estimating these functions. Furthermore, we establish nonasymptotic error bounds for learning the target conditional distribution. We illustrate the application of CSI on image generation using a benchmark image dataset.</p></details> | 60 pages, 4 figures |

Traditional generative architectures such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Auto Encoder (VAEs) have shown great promise for high-resolution image generation but struggle with preserving fine-grained details that are key for accurate diagnosis. To address this issue, we introduce Pixel Perfect MegaMed, the first vision-language foundation model to synthesize images at resolutions of 1024x1024. Our method deploys a multi-scale transformer architecture designed specifically for ultra-high resolution medical image generation, enabling the preservation of both global anatomical context and local image-level details. By leveraging vision-language alignment techniques tailored to medical terminology and imaging modalities, Pixel Perfect MegaMed bridges the gap between textual descriptions and visual representations at unprecedented resolution levels. We apply our model to the CheXpert dataset and demonstrate its ability to generate clinically faithful chest X-rays from text prompts. Beyond visual quality, these high-resolution synthetic images prove valuable for downstream tasks such as classification, showing measurable performance gains when used for data augmentation, particularly in low-data regimes. Our code is accessible through the project website - https://tehraninasab.github.io/pixelperfect-megamed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imperceptible Protection against Style Imitation from Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19254v3)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in diffusion models has profoundly enhanced the fidelity of image generation, but it has raised concerns about copyright infringements. While prior methods have introduced adversarial perturbations to prevent style imitation, most are accompanied by the degradation of artworks' visual quality. Recognizing the importance of maintaining this, we introduce a visually improved protection method while preserving its protection capability. To this end, we devise a perceptual map to highlight areas sensitive to human eyes, guided by instance-aware refinement, which refines the protection intensity accordingly. We also introduce a difficulty-aware protection by predicting how difficult the artwork is to protect and dynamically adjusting the intensity based on this. Lastly, we integrate a perceptual constraints bank to further improve the imperceptibility. Results show that our method substantially elevates the quality of the protected image without compromising on protection efficacy.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose JCo-MVTON (Jointly Controllable Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer for Mask-Free Virtual Try-On), a novel framework that overcomes these limitations by integrating diffusion-based image generation with multi-modal conditional fusion. Built upon a Multi-Modal Diffusion Transformer (MM-DiT) backbone, our approach directly incorporates diverse control signals -- such as the reference person image and the target garment image -- into the denoising process through dedicated conditional pathways that fuse features within the self-attention layers. This fusion is further enhanced with refined positional encodings and attention masks, enabling precise spatial alignment and improved garment-person integration. To address data scarcity and quality, we introduce a bidirectional generation strategy for dataset construction: one pipeline uses a mask-based model to generate realistic reference images, while a symmetric ``Try-Off'' model, trained in a self-supervised manner, recovers the corresponding garment images. The synthesized dataset undergoes rigorous manual curation, allowing iterative improvement in visual fidelity and diversity. Experiments demonstrate that JCo-MVTON achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks including DressCode, significantly outperforming existing methods in both quantitative metrics and human evaluations. Moreover, it shows strong generalization in real-world applications, surpassing commercial systems.</p></details> |  |

It is not species specific and has been applied to Grevy's and plains zebras, giraffes, leopards, and lionfish. We describe two approaches, both based on extracting and matching keypoints or "hotspots". The first tests each new query image sequentially against each database image, generating a score for each database image in isolation, and ranking the results. The second, building on recent techniques for instance recognition, matches the query image against the database using a fast nearest neighbor search. It uses a competitive scoring mechanism derived from the Local Naive Bayes Nearest Neighbor algorithm recently proposed for category recognition. We demonstrate results on databases of more than 1000 images, producing more accurate matches than published methods and matching each query image in just a few seconds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Origi...</summary><p>Original matlab code: https://github.com/Erotemic/hotspotter-matlab-2013, Python port: https://github.com/Erotemic/hotspotter</p></details> |

| **[Bias Amplification in Stable Diffusion's Representation of Stigma Through Skin Tones and Their Homogeneity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17465v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generators (T2Is) are liable to produce images that perpetuate social stereotypes, especially in regards to race or skin tone. We use a comprehensive set of 93 stigmatized identities to determine that three versions of Stable Diffusion (v1.5, v2.1, and XL) systematically associate stigmatized identities with certain skin tones in generated images. We find that SD XL produces skin tones that are 13.53% darker and 23.76% less red (both of which indicate higher likelihood of societal discrimination) than previous models and perpetuate societal stereotypes associating people of color with stigmatized identities. SD XL also shows approximately 30% less variability in skin tones when compared to previous models and 18.89-56.06% compared to human face datasets. Measuring variability through metrics which directly correspond to human perception suggest a similar pattern, where SD XL shows the least amount of variability in skin tones of people with stigmatized identities and depicts most (60.29%) stigmatized identities as being less diverse than non-stigmatized identities. Finally, SD shows more homogenization of skin tones of racial and ethnic identities compared to other stigmatized or non-stigmatized identities, reinforcing incorrect equivalence of biologically-determined skin tone and socially-constructed racial and ethnic identity. Because SD XL is the largest and most complex model and users prefer its generations compared to other models examined in this study, these findings have implications for the dynamics of bias amplification in T2Is, increasing representational harms and challenges generating diverse images depicting people with stigmatized identities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of the 2024 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society; code available at https://github.com/kyrawilson/Image-Generation-Bias</p></details> |
| **[Condition Weaving Meets Expert Modulation: Towards Universal and Controllable Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17364v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The image-to-image generation task aims to produce controllable images by leveraging conditional inputs and prompt instructions. However, existing methods often train separate control branches for each type of condition, leading to redundant model structures and inefficient use of computational resources. To address this, we propose a Unified image-to-image Generation (UniGen) framework that supports diverse conditional inputs while enhancing generation efficiency and expressiveness. Specifically, to tackle the widely existing parameter redundancy and computational inefficiency in controllable conditional generation architectures, we propose the Condition Modulated Expert (CoMoE) module. This module aggregates semantically similar patch features and assigns them to dedicated expert modules for visual representation and conditional modeling. By enabling independent modeling of foreground features under different conditions, CoMoE effectively mitigates feature entanglement and redundant computation in multi-condition scenarios. Furthermore, to bridge the information gap between the backbone and control branches, we propose WeaveNet, a dynamic, snake-like connection mechanism that enables effective interaction between global text-level control from the backbone and fine-grained control from conditional branches. Extensive experiments on the Subjects-200K and MultiGen-20M datasets across various conditional image generation tasks demonstrate that our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its advantages in both versatility and effectiveness. The code has been uploaded to https://github.com/gavin-gqzhang/UniGen.</p></details> |  |
| **[DiCache: Let Diffusion Model Determine Its Own Cache](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17356v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid development of acceleration techniques for diffusion models, especially caching-based acceleration methods. These studies seek to answer two fundamental questions: "When to cache" and "How to use cache", typically relying on predefined empirical laws or dataset-level priors to determine the timing of caching and utilizing handcrafted rules for leveraging multi-step caches. However, given the highly dynamic nature of the diffusion process, they often exhibit limited generalizability and fail on outlier samples. In this paper, a strong correlation is revealed between the variation patterns of the shallow-layer feature differences in the diffusion model and those of final model outputs. Moreover, we have observed that the features from different model layers form similar trajectories. Based on these observations, we present DiCache, a novel training-free adaptive caching strategy for accelerating diffusion models at runtime, answering both when and how to cache within a unified framework. Specifically, DiCache is composed of two principal components: (1) Online Probe Profiling Scheme leverages a shallow-layer online probe to obtain a stable prior for the caching error in real time, enabling the model to autonomously determine caching schedules. (2) Dynamic Cache Trajectory Alignment combines multi-step caches based on shallow-layer probe feature trajectory to better approximate the current feature, facilitating higher visual quality. Extensive experiments validate DiCache's capability in achieving higher efficiency and improved visual fidelity over state-of-the-art methods on various leading diffusion models including WAN 2.1, HunyuanVideo for video generation, and Flux for image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[GigaTok: Scaling Visual Tokenizers to 3 Billion Parameters for Autoregressive Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08736v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In autoregressive (AR) image generation, visual tokenizers compress images into compact discrete latent tokens, enabling efficient training of downstream autoregressive models for visual generation via next-token prediction. While scaling visual tokenizers improves image reconstruction quality, it often degrades downstream generation quality -- a challenge not adequately addressed in existing literature. To address this, we introduce GigaTok, the first approach to simultaneously improve image reconstruction, generation, and representation learning when scaling visual tokenizers. We identify the growing complexity of latent space as the key factor behind the reconstruction vs. generation dilemma. To mitigate this, we propose semantic regularization, which aligns tokenizer features with semantically consistent features from a pre-trained visual encoder. This constraint prevents excessive latent space complexity during scaling, yielding consistent improvements in both reconstruction and downstream autoregressive generation. Building on semantic regularization, we explore three key practices for scaling tokenizers:(1) using 1D tokenizers for better scalability, (2) prioritizing decoder scaling when expanding both encoder and decoder, and (3) employing entropy loss to stabilize training for billion-scale tokenizers. By scaling to $\bf{3 \space billion}$ parameters, GigaTok achieves state-of-the-art performance in reconstruction, downstream AR generation, and downstream AR representation quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICCV ...</summary><p>ICCV 2025.

| **[Multi-Metric Preference Alignment for Generative Speech Restoration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17229v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent generative models have significantly advanced speech restoration tasks, yet their training objectives often misalign with human perceptual preferences, resulting in suboptimal quality. While post-training alignment has proven effective in other generative domains like text and image generation, its application to generative speech restoration remains largely under-explored. This work investigates the challenges of applying preference-based post-training to this task, focusing on how to define a robust preference signal and curate high-quality data to avoid reward hacking. To address these challenges, we propose a multi-metric preference alignment strategy. We construct a new dataset, GenSR-Pref, comprising 80K preference pairs, where each chosen sample is unanimously favored by a complementary suite of metrics covering perceptual quality, signal fidelity, content consistency, and timbre preservation. This principled approach ensures a holistic preference signal. Applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with our dataset, we observe consistent and significant performance gains across three diverse generative paradigms: autoregressive models (AR), masked generative models (MGM), and flow-matching models (FM) on various restoration benchmarks, in both objective and subjective evaluations. Ablation studies confirm the superiority of our multi-metric strategy over single-metric approaches in mitigating reward hacking. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our aligned models can serve as powerful ''data annotators'', generating high-quality pseudo-labels to serve as a supervision signal for traditional discriminative models in data-scarce scenarios like singing voice restoration.

| **[CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017 demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is made publicly available at https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.</p></details> |  |

Because no existing datasets are available for this task, we propose a multimodal pseudo-labeling method to construct high-quality datasets at low cost. We first collect documents that contain multiple images with their captions, and their summaries by excluding factually inconsistent instances. Our approach selects one image from the multiple images accompanying the documents. Using the gold summary, we independently rank both the images and their captions. Then, we annotate a pseudo-label for an image when both the image and its corresponding caption are ranked first in their respective rankings. Finally, we remove documents that contain direct image references within texts. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multimodal pseudo-labeling method constructs more precise datasets and generates higher quality images than text- and image-only pseudo-labeling methods, which consider captions and images separately. We release our code at: https://github.com/HyeyeeonKim/MMCIG</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we show that multi-modal embeddings can be vulnerable to an attack we call "adversarial illusions." Given an image or a sound, an adversary can perturb it to make its embedding close to an arbitrary, adversary-chosen input in another modality. These attacks are cross-modal and targeted: the adversary can align any image or sound with any target of his choice. Adversarial illusions exploit proximity in the embedding space and are thus agnostic to downstream tasks and modalities, enabling a wholesale compromise of current and future tasks, as well as modalities not available to the adversary. Using ImageBind and AudioCLIP embeddings, we demonstrate how adversarially aligned inputs, generated without knowledge of specific downstream tasks, mislead image generation, text generation, zero-shot classification, and audio retrieval. We investigate transferability of illusions across different embeddings and develop a black-box version of our method that we use to demonstrate the first adversarial alignment attack on Amazon's commercial, proprietary Titan embedding. Finally, we analyze countermeasures and evasion attacks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In US...</summary><p>In USENIX Security'24</p></details> |

Our approach leverages textual inversion and diffusion-based guided image generation to augment small style datasets. By systematically generating diverse style samples guided by both the original style images and real face images, we significantly enhance the diversity of the style dataset. Using this augmented dataset, we train fast image-to-image translation networks that outperform diffusion-based methods in speed and quality. Experiments on multiple styles demonstrate that our method improves stylization quality, better preserves source image content, and significantly accelerates inference. Additionally, we provide a systematic evaluation of the augmentation techniques and their impact on stylization performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watermarking Visual Concepts for Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11688v3)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The personalization techniques of diffusion models succeed in generating images with specific concepts. This ability also poses great threats to copyright protection and network security since malicious users can generate unauthorized content and disinformation relevant to a target concept. Model watermarking is an effective solution to trace the malicious generated images and safeguard their copyright. However, existing model watermarking techniques merely achieve image-level tracing without concept traceability. When tracing infringing or harmful concepts, current approaches execute image concept detection and model tracing sequentially, where performance is critically constrained by concept detection accuracy. In this paper, we propose a lightweight concept watermarking framework that efficiently binds target concepts to model watermarks, supporting simultaneous concept identification and model tracing via single-stage watermark verification. To further enhance the robustness of concept watermarking, we propose an adversarial perturbation injection method collaboratively embedded with watermarks during image generation, avoiding watermark removal by model purification attacks. Experimental results demonstrate that ConceptWM significantly outperforms state-of-the-art watermarking methods, improving detection accuracy by 6.3%-19.3% across diverse datasets including COCO and StableDiffusionDB. Additionally, ConceptWM possesses a critical capability absent in other watermarking methods: it sustains a 21.7% FID/CLIP degradation under adversarial fine-tuning of Stable Diffusion models on WikiArt and CelebA-HQ, demonstrating its capability to mitigate model misuse.</p></details> |  |
| **[FaceCrafter: Identity-Conditional Diffusion with Disentangled Control over Facial Pose, Expression, and Emotion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15313v2)** | 2025-08-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human facial images encode a rich spectrum of information, encompassing both stable identity-related traits and mutable attributes such as pose, expression, and emotion. While recent advances in image generation have enabled high-quality identity-conditional face synthesis, precise control over non-identity attributes remains challenging, and disentangling identity from these mutable factors is particularly difficult. To address these limitations, we propose a novel identity-conditional diffusion model that introduces two lightweight control modules designed to independently manipulate facial pose, expression, and emotion without compromising identity preservation. These modules are embedded within the cross-attention layers of the base diffusion model, enabling precise attribute control with minimal parameter overhead. Furthermore, our tailored training strategy, which leverages cross-attention between the identity feature and each non-identity control feature, encourages identity features to remain orthogonal to control signals, enhancing controllability and diversity. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations, along with perceptual user studies, demonstrate that our method surpasses existing approaches in terms of control accuracy over pose, expression, and emotion, while also improving generative diversity under identity-only conditioning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages(excluding references), 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
