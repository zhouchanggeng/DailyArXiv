| **[In-Context Learning with Unpaired Clips for Instruction-based Video Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14648v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid progress of instruction-based image editing, its extension to video remains underexplored, primarily due to the prohibitive cost and complexity of constructing large-scale paired video editing datasets. To address this challenge, we introduce a low-cost pretraining strategy for instruction-based video editing that leverages in-context learning from unpaired video clips. We show that pretraining a foundation video generation model with this strategy endows it with general editing capabilities, such as adding, replacing, or deleting operations, according to input editing instructions. The pretrained model can then be efficiently refined with a small amount of high-quality paired editing data. Built upon HunyuanVideoT2V, our framework first pretrains on approximately 1M real video clips to learn basic editing concepts, and subsequently fine-tunes on fewer than 150k curated editing pairs to extend more editing tasks and improve the editing quality. Comparative experiments show that our method surpasses existing instruction-based video editing approaches in both instruction alignment and visual fidelity, achieving a 12\% improvement in editing instruction following and a 15\% improvement in editing quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CE-GPPO: Coordinating Entropy via Gradient-Preserving Clipping Policy Optimization in Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20712v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a powerful paradigm for optimizing large language models (LLMs) to handle complex reasoning tasks. A core challenge in this process lies in managing policy entropy, which reflects the balance between exploration and exploitation during training. Existing methods, such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) and its variants, discard valuable gradient signals from low-probability tokens due to the clipping mechanism. We systematically analyze the entropy dynamics and reveal that these clipped tokens play a critical yet overlooked role in regulating entropy evolution. We propose \textbf{C}oordinating \textbf{E}ntropy via \textbf{G}radient-\textbf{P}reserving \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization (CE-GPPO), a novel algorithm that reintroduces gradients from clipped tokens in native PPO in a gentle and bounded manner. By controlling the magnitude of gradients from tokens outside the clipping interval, CE-GPPO is able to achieve an exploration-exploitation trade-off. We provide theoretical justification and empirical evidence showing that CE-GPPO effectively mitigates entropy instability. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks show that CE-GPPO consistently outperforms strong baselines across different model scales.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data or Language Supervision: What Makes CLIP Better than DINO?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11835v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>CLIP outperforms self-supervised models like DINO as vision encoders for vision-language models (VLMs), but it remains unclear whether this advantage stems from CLIP's language supervision or its much larger training data. To disentangle these factors, we pre-train CLIP and DINO under controlled settings -- using the same architecture, dataset, and training configuration -- achieving similar ImageNet accuracy. Embedding analysis shows that CLIP captures high-level semantics (e.g., object categories, text), while DINO is more responsive to low-level features like colors and styles. When integrated into VLMs and evaluated on 20 VQA benchmarks, CLIP excels at text-intensive tasks, while DINO slightly outperforms on vision-centric ones. Variants of language supervision (e.g., sigmoid loss, pre-trained language encoders) yield limited gains. Our findings provide scientific insights into vision encoder design and its impact on VLM performance.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |
| **[Clip Your Sequences Fairly: Enforcing Length Fairness for Sequence-Level RL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09177v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose FSPO (Fair Sequence Policy Optimization), a sequence-level reinforcement learning method for LLMs that enforces length-fair clipping on the importance-sampling (IS) weight. We study RL methods with sequence-level IS and identify a mismatch when PPO/GRPO-style clipping is transplanted to sequences: a fixed clip range systematically reweights short vs. long responses, distorting the optimization direction. FSPO introduces a simple remedy: we clip the sequence log-IS ratio with a band that scales as $\sqrt{L}$. Theoretically, we formalize length fairness via a Length Reweighting Error (LRE) and prove that small LRE yields a cosine directional guarantee between the clipped and true updates. Empirically, FSPO flattens clip rates across length bins, stabilizes training, and outperforms baselines across model sizes and evaluation datasets, with the largest gains on the Qwen3-8B-Base model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection: CLIP-SAM Collaboration with Cascaded Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11028v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, the powerful generalization ability exhibited by foundation models has brought forth new solutions for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks. However, guiding these foundation models correctly to address downstream tasks remains a challenge. This paper proposes a novel two-stage framework, for zero-shot anomaly segmentation tasks in industrial anomaly detection. This framework excellently leverages the powerful anomaly localization capability of CLIP and the boundary perception ability of SAM.(1) To mitigate SAM's inclination towards object segmentation, we propose the Co-Feature Point Prompt Generation (PPG) module. This module collaboratively utilizes CLIP and SAM to generate positive and negative point prompts, guiding SAM to focus on segmenting anomalous regions rather than the entire object. (2) To further optimize SAM's segmentation results and mitigate rough boundaries and isolated noise, we introduce the Cascaded Prompts for SAM (CPS) module. This module employs hybrid prompts cascaded with a lightweight decoder of SAM, achieving precise segmentation of anomalous regions. Across multiple datasets, consistent experimental validation demonstrates that our approach achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot anomaly segmentation results. Particularly noteworthy is our performance on the Visa dataset, where we outperform the state-of-the-art methods by 10.3\% and 7.7\% in terms of {$F_1$-max} and AP metrics, respectively.</p></details> | Accepted by PRCV |
| **[FG-CLIP 2: A Bilingual Fine-grained Vision-Language Alignment Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10921v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained vision-language understanding requires precise alignment between visual content and linguistic descriptions, a capability that remains limited in current models, particularly in non-English settings. While models like CLIP perform well on global alignment, they often struggle to capture fine-grained details in object attributes, spatial relations, and linguistic expressions, with limited support for bilingual comprehension. To address these challenges, we introduce FG-CLIP 2, a bilingual vision-language model designed to advance fine-grained alignment for both English and Chinese. Our approach leverages rich fine-grained supervision, including region-text matching and long-caption modeling, alongside multiple discriminative objectives. We further introduce the Textual Intra-modal Contrastive (TIC) loss to better distinguish semantically similar captions. Trained on a carefully curated mixture of large-scale English and Chinese data, FG-CLIP 2 achieves powerful bilingual performance. To enable rigorous evaluation, we present a new benchmark for Chinese multimodal understanding, featuring long-caption retrieval and bounding box classification. Extensive experiments on 29 datasets across 8 tasks show that FG-CLIP 2 outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in both languages. We release the model, code, and benchmark to facilitate future research on bilingual fine-grained alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Second-order Optimization under Heavy-Tailed Noise: Hessian Clipping and Sample Complexity Limits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10690v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Heavy-tailed noise is pervasive in modern machine learning applications, arising from data heterogeneity, outliers, and non-stationary stochastic environments. While second-order methods can significantly accelerate convergence in light-tailed or bounded-noise settings, such algorithms are often brittle and lack guarantees under heavy-tailed noise -- precisely the regimes where robustness is most critical. In this work, we take a first step toward a theoretical understanding of second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. We consider a setting where stochastic gradients and Hessians have only bounded $p$-th moments, for some $p\in (1,2]$, and establish tight lower bounds on the sample complexity of any second-order method. We then develop a variant of normalized stochastic gradient descent that leverages second-order information and provably matches these lower bounds. To address the instability caused by large deviations, we introduce a novel algorithm based on gradient and Hessian clipping, and prove high-probability upper bounds that nearly match the fundamental limits. Our results provide the first comprehensive sample complexity characterization for second-order optimization under heavy-tailed noise. This positions Hessian clipping as a robust and theoretically sound strategy for second-order algorithm design in heavy-tailed regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[HAVIR: HierArchical Vision to Image Reconstruction using CLIP-Guided Versatile Diffusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03122v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reconstruction of visual information from brain activity fosters interdisciplinary integration between neuroscience and computer vision. However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-IN: Enhancing Fine-Grained Visual Understanding in CLIP via Instruction Editing Data and Long Captions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02329v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the success of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like CLIP in aligning vision and language, their proficiency in detailed, fine-grained visual comprehension remains a key challenge. We present CLIP-IN, a novel framework that bolsters CLIP's fine-grained perception through two core innovations. Firstly, we leverage instruction-editing datasets, originally designed for image manipulation, as a unique source of hard negative image-text pairs. Coupled with a symmetric hard negative contrastive loss, this enables the model to effectively distinguish subtle visual-semantic differences. Secondly, CLIP-IN incorporates long descriptive captions, utilizing rotary positional encodings to capture rich semantic context often missed by standard CLIP. Our experiments demonstrate that CLIP-IN achieves substantial gains on the MMVP benchmark and various fine-grained visual recognition tasks, without compromising robust zero-shot performance on broader classification and retrieval tasks. Critically, integrating CLIP-IN's visual representations into Multimodal Large Language Models significantly reduces visual hallucinations and enhances reasoning abilities. This work underscores the considerable potential of synergizing targeted, instruction-based contrastive learning with comprehensive descriptive information to elevate the fine-grained understanding of VLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[RATLIP: Generative Adversarial CLIP Text-to-Image Synthesis Based on Recurrent Affine Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08114v2)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Synthesizing high-quality photorealistic images with textual descriptions as a condition is very challenging. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), the classical model for this task, frequently suffer from low consistency between image and text descriptions and insufficient richness in synthesized images. Recently, conditional affine transformations (CAT), such as conditional batch normalization and instance normalization, have been applied to different layers of GAN to control content synthesis in images. CAT is a multi-layer perceptron that independently predicts data based on batch statistics between neighboring layers, with global textual information unavailable to other layers. To address this issue, we first model CAT and a recurrent neural network (RAT) to ensure that different layers can access global information. We then introduce shuffle attention between RAT to mitigate the characteristic of information forgetting in recurrent neural networks. Moreover, both our generator and discriminator utilize the powerful pre-trained model, Clip, which has been extensively employed for establishing associations between text and images through the learning of multimodal representations in latent space. The discriminator utilizes CLIP's ability to comprehend complex scenes to accurately assess the quality of the generated images. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the CUB, Oxford, and CelebA-tiny datasets to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model over current state-of-the-art models. The code is https://github.com/OxygenLu/RATLIP.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 2024 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics(SMC)</p></details> |
| **[CAPE: A CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble of Complementary Heatmap Cues for Embodied Reference Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21888v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of Embodied Reference Understanding, which involves predicting the object that a person in the scene is referring to through both pointing gesture and language. Accurately identifying the referent requires multimodal understanding: integrating textual instructions, visual pointing, and scene context. However, existing methods often struggle to effectively leverage visual clues for disambiguation. We also observe that, while the referent is often aligned with the head-to-fingertip line, it occasionally aligns more closely with the wrist-to-fingertip line. Therefore, relying on a single line assumption can be overly simplistic and may lead to suboptimal performance. To address this, we propose a dual-model framework, where one model learns from the head-to-fingertip direction and the other from the wrist-to-fingertip direction. We further introduce a Gaussian ray heatmap representation of these lines and use them as input to provide a strong supervisory signal that encourages the model to better attend to pointing cues. To combine the strengths of both models, we present the CLIP-Aware Pointing Ensemble module, which performs a hybrid ensemble based on CLIP features. Additionally, we propose an object center prediction head as an auxiliary task to further enhance referent localization. We validate our approach through extensive experiments and analysis on the benchmark YouRefIt dataset, achieving an improvement of approximately 4 mAP at the 0.25 IoU threshold. We further evaluate our approach on the CAESAR and ISL Pointing datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness in Both Domains: CLIP Needs a Robust Text Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03355v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Adversarial input attacks can cause a significant shift of CLIP embeddings. This can affect the downstream robustness of models incorporating CLIP in the pipeline, such as text-to-image generative models or large vision language models. While some efforts have been done towards making the CLIP image encoders robust, the robustness of text encoders remains unexplored. In this work, we cover this gap in the literature. We propose LEAF: an efficient adversarial finetuning method for the text domain, with the ability to scale to large CLIP models. Our models significantly improve the zero-shot adversarial accuracy in the text domain, while maintaining the vision performance provided by robust image encoders. When combined with text-to-image diffusion models, we can improve the generation quality under adversarial noise. In multimodal retrieval tasks, LEAF improves the recall under adversarial noise over standard CLIP models. Finally, we show that robust text encoders facilitate better reconstruction of input text from its embedding via direct optimization. We open-source our code ( https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/LEAF ) and models ( https://huggingface.co/LEAF-CLIP ).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose UniLIP, a unified framework that adapts CLIP for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks. Code and models are available at https://github.com/nnnth/UniLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Concept Localization in CLIP-based Concept Bottleneck Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07115v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses explainable AI (XAI) through the lens of Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) that do not require explicit concept annotations, relying instead on concepts extracted using CLIP in a zero-shot manner. We show that CLIP, which is central in these techniques, is prone to concept hallucination, incorrectly predicting the presence or absence of concepts within an image in scenarios used in numerous CBMs, hence undermining the faithfulness of explanations. To mitigate this issue, we introduce Concept Hallucination Inhibition via Localized Interpretability (CHILI), a technique that disentangles image embeddings and localizes pixels corresponding to target concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports the generation of saliency-based explanations that are more interpretable.</p></details> |  |
| **[SoftAdaClip: A Smooth Clipping Strategy for Fair and Private Model Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01447v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differential privacy (DP) provides strong protection for sensitive data, but often reduces model performance and fairness, especially for underrepresented groups. One major reason is gradient clipping in DP-SGD, which can disproportionately suppress learning signals for minority subpopulations. Although adaptive clipping can enhance utility, it still relies on uniform hard clipping, which may restrict fairness. To address this, we introduce SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are statistically significant. These findings underscore the importance of integrating smooth transformations with adaptive mechanisms to achieve fair and private model training.</p></details> |  |
| **[DP-Adam-AC: Privacy-preserving Fine-Tuning of Localizable Language Models Using Adam Optimization with Adaptive Clipping](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05288v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have evolved into powerful and ubiquitous tools. Fine-tuning on small datasets allows LLMs to acquire specialized skills for specific tasks efficiently. Although LLMs provide great utility in both general and task-specific use cases, they are limited by two security-related concerns. First, traditional LLM hardware requirements make them infeasible to run locally on consumer-grade devices. A remote network connection with the LLM provider's server is usually required, making the system vulnerable to network attacks. Second, fine-tuning an LLM for a sensitive task may involve sensitive data. Non-private fine-tuning algorithms produce models vulnerable to training data reproduction attacks. Our work addresses these security concerns by enhancing differentially private optimization algorithms and applying them to fine-tune localizable language models. We introduce adaptable gradient clipping along with other engineering enhancements to the standard DP-Adam optimizer to create DP-Adam-AC. We use our optimizer to fine-tune examples of two localizable LLM designs, small language model (Qwen2.5-0.5B) and 1.58 bit quantization (Bitnet-b1.58-2B). We demonstrate promising improvements in loss through experimentation with two synthetic datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward a Holistic Evaluation of Robustness in CLIP Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01534v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models have shown significant potential, particularly in zero-shot classification across diverse distribution shifts. Building on existing evaluations of overall classification robustness, this work aims to provide a more comprehensive assessment of CLIP by introducing several new perspectives. First, we investigate their robustness to variations in specific visual factors. Second, we assess two critical safety objectives--confidence uncertainty and out-of-distribution detection--beyond mere classification accuracy. Third, we evaluate the finesse with which CLIP models bridge the image and text modalities. Fourth, we extend our examination to 3D awareness in CLIP models, moving beyond traditional 2D image understanding. Finally, we explore the interaction between vision and language encoders within modern large multimodal models (LMMs) that utilize CLIP as the visual backbone, focusing on how this interaction impacts classification robustness. In each aspect, we consider the impact of six factors on CLIP models: model architecture, training distribution, training set size, fine-tuning, contrastive loss, and test-time prompts. Our study uncovers several previously unknown insights into CLIP. For instance, the architecture of the visual encoder in CLIP plays a significant role in their robustness against 3D corruption. CLIP models tend to exhibit a bias towards shape when making predictions. Moreover, this bias tends to diminish after fine-tuning on ImageNet. Vision-language models like LLaVA, leveraging the CLIP vision encoder, could exhibit benefits in classification performance for challenging categories over CLIP alone. Our findings are poised to offer valuable guidance for enhancing the robustness and reliability of CLIP models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE TPAMI, extension of NeurIPS'23 work: A Closer Look at the Robustness of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP)</p></details> |
| **[From Long Videos to Engaging Clips: A Human-Inspired Video Editing Framework with Multimodal Narrative Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02790v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of online video content, especially on short video platforms, has created a growing demand for efficient video editing techniques that can condense long-form videos into concise and engaging clips. Existing automatic editing methods predominantly rely on textual cues from ASR transcripts and end-to-end segment selection, often neglecting the rich visual context and leading to incoherent outputs. In this paper, we propose a human-inspired automatic video editing framework (HIVE) that leverages multimodal narrative understanding to address these limitations. Our approach incorporates character extraction, dialogue analysis, and narrative summarization through multimodal large language models, enabling a holistic understanding of the video content. To further enhance coherence, we apply scene-level segmentation and decompose the editing process into three subtasks: highlight detection, opening/ending selection, and pruning of irrelevant content. To facilitate research in this area, we introduce DramaAD, a novel benchmark dataset comprising over 800 short drama episodes and 500 professionally edited advertisement clips. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms existing baselines across both general and advertisement-oriented editing tasks, significantly narrowing the quality gap between automatic and human-edited videos.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by EMNLP 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[microCLIP: Unsupervised CLIP Adaptation via Coarse-Fine Token Fusion for Fine-Grained Image Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02270v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised adaptation of CLIP-based vision-language models (VLMs) for fine-grained image classification requires sensitivity to microscopic local cues. While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation. Our code is available at https://github.com/sathiiii/microCLIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Frames to Clips: Efficient Key Clip Selection for Long-Form Video Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02262v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video Large Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable results on a variety of vision language tasks, yet their practical use is limited by the "needle in a haystack" problem: the massive number of visual tokens produced from raw video frames exhausts the model's context window. Existing solutions alleviate this issue by selecting a sparse set of frames, thereby reducing token count, but such frame-wise selection discards essential temporal dynamics, leading to suboptimal reasoning about motion and event continuity. In this work we systematically explore the impact of temporal information and demonstrate that extending selection from isolated key frames to key clips, which are short, temporally coherent segments, improves video understanding. To maintain a fixed computational budget while accommodating the larger token footprint of clips, we propose an adaptive resolution strategy that dynamically balances spatial resolution and clip length, ensuring a constant token count per video. Experiments on three long-form video benchmarks demonstrate that our training-free approach, F2C, outperforms uniform sampling up to 8.1%, 5.6%, and 10.3% on Video-MME, LongVideoBench and MLVU benchmarks, respectively. These results highlight the importance of preserving temporal coherence in frame selection and provide a practical pathway for scaling Video LLMs to real world video understanding applications.

| **[AniMaker: Multi-Agent Animated Storytelling with MCTS-Driven Clip Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10540v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid advancements in video generation models, generating coherent storytelling videos that span multiple scenes and characters remains challenging. Current methods often rigidly convert pre-generated keyframes into fixed-length clips, resulting in disjointed narratives and pacing issues. Furthermore, the inherent instability of video generation models means that even a single low-quality clip can significantly degrade the entire output animation's logical coherence and visual continuity. To overcome these obstacles, we introduce AniMaker, a multi-agent framework enabling efficient multi-candidate clip generation and storytelling-aware clip selection, thus creating globally consistent and story-coherent animation solely from text input. The framework is structured around specialized agents, including the Director Agent for storyboard generation, the Photography Agent for video clip generation, the Reviewer Agent for evaluation, and the Post-Production Agent for editing and voiceover. Central to AniMaker's approach are two key technical components: MCTS-Gen in Photography Agent, an efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-inspired strategy that intelligently navigates the candidate space to generate high-potential clips while optimizing resource usage; and AniEval in Reviewer Agent, the first framework specifically designed for multi-shot animation evaluation, which assesses critical aspects such as story-level consistency, action completion, and animation-specific features by considering each clip in the context of its preceding and succeeding clips. Experiments demonstrate that AniMaker achieves superior quality as measured by popular metrics including VBench and our proposed AniEval framework, while significantly improving the efficiency of multi-candidate generation, pushing AI-generated storytelling animation closer to production standards.</p></details> |  |
| **[Gradient Shaping Beyond Clipping: A Functional Perspective on Update Magnitude Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01578v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping is widely used to stabilize deep network training, but its formulation as a hard, fixed threshold limits flexibility and ignores gradient distribution dynamics. We propose SPAMP (Statistical Per-layer Adaptive Modulation and Projection), a unified framework that generalizes clipping into smooth, per-layer gradient shaping. SPAMP tracks local gradient statistics, dynamically estimates thresholds, and applies power-based transformations to modulate update magnitudes in a differentiable manner. This perspective recasts clipping and warmup as dual mechanisms for controlling the effective update scale $\eta_t \|g_t\|$, offering a principled alternative to rigid heuristics. Extensive experiments across image and language tasks demonstrate that SPAMP improves stability, convergence, and robustness over existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ACM Multimedia Asia 2025</p></details> |
| **[SeMoBridge: Semantic Modality Bridge for Efficient Few-Shot Adaptation of CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26036v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) excels at zero-shot tasks by aligning image and text embeddings, its performance in few-shot classification is hindered by a critical limitation: intra-modal misalignment. This issue, caused by a persistent modality gap and CLIP's exclusively inter-modal training objective, leaves the embedding spaces uncalibrated, making direct image-to-image comparisons unreliable. Existing methods attempt to address this by refining similarity logits or by computationally expensive per-sample optimization. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SeMoBridge, a lightweight yet powerful approach that directly addresses the misalignment. Our method maps images into the text modality, while keeping their semantic content intact through what we call a Semantic Modality Bridge. SeMoBridge is closed-form and can optionally be trained through multi-modal supervision, combining image and text-alignment losses to optimize the projection. Experiments show that the trained version, SeMoBridge-T, requires only a fraction of the training time while overall outperforming other methods, particularly in low-data scenarios (1, 2, and 4 shots). The code is available at https://github.com/christti98/semobridge.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 12 figures, Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Clip-Low Increases Entropy and Clip-High Decreases Entropy in Reinforcement Learning of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26114v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as the leading approach for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, RLVR is prone to entropy collapse, where the LLM quickly converges to a near-deterministic form, hindering exploration and progress during prolonged RL training. In this work, we reveal that the clipping mechanism in PPO and GRPO induces biases on entropy. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that clip-low increases entropy, while clip-high decreases it. Further, under standard clipping parameters, the effect of clip-high dominates, resulting in an overall entropy reduction even when purely random rewards are provided to the RL algorithm. Our findings highlight an overlooked confounding factor in RLVR: independent of the reward signal, the clipping mechanism influences entropy, which in turn affects the reasoning behavior. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that clipping can be deliberately used to control entropy. Specifically, with a more aggressive clip-low value, one can increase entropy, promote exploration, and ultimately prevent entropy collapse in RLVR training.</p></details> |  |

This poses challenges for scientific research that needs fine-grained control over the training procedure of CLIP models. In this work, we show that by employing smart web search strategies enhanced with knowledge graphs, a robust CLIP model can be trained from scratch with considerably less data. Specifically, we demonstrate that an expert foundation model for living organisms can be built using just 10M images. Moreover, we introduce EntityNet, a dataset comprising 33M images paired with 46M text descriptions, which enables the training of a generic CLIP model in significantly reduced time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for oral presentation at GCPR 2025 (German Conference on Pattern Recognition).

A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The powerful zero-shot generalization capabilities of vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP have enabled new paradigms for safety-related tasks such as out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. However, additional aspects crucial for the computationally efficient and reliable deployment of CLIP are still overlooked. In particular, the impact of quantization on CLIP's performance beyond accuracy remains underexplored. This work presents a large-scale evaluation of quantization on CLIP models, assessing not only in-distribution accuracy but a comprehensive suite of reliability metrics and revealing counterintuitive results driven by pre-training source. We demonstrate that quantization consistently improves calibration for typically underconfident pre-trained models, while often degrading it for overconfident variants. Intriguingly, this degradation in calibration does not preclude gains in other reliability metrics; we find that OOD detection can still improve for these same poorly calibrated models. Furthermore, we identify specific quantization-aware training (QAT) methods that yield simultaneous gains in zero-shot accuracy, calibration, and OOD robustness, challenging the view of a strict efficiency-performance trade-off. These findings offer critical insights for navigating the multi-objective problem of deploying efficient, reliable, and robust VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | Still unpolished |
| **[Differentially Private Clipped-SGD: High-Probability Convergence with Arbitrary Clipping Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23512v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient clipping is a fundamental tool in Deep Learning, improving the high-probability convergence of stochastic first-order methods like SGD, AdaGrad, and Adam under heavy-tailed noise, which is common in training large language models. It is also a crucial component of Differential Privacy (DP) mechanisms. However, existing high-probability convergence analyses typically require the clipping threshold to increase with the number of optimization steps, which is incompatible with standard DP mechanisms like the Gaussian mechanism. In this work, we close this gap by providing the first high-probability convergence analysis for DP-Clipped-SGD with a fixed clipping level, applicable to both convex and non-convex smooth optimization under heavy-tailed noise, characterized by a bounded central $\alpha$-th moment assumption, $\alpha \in (1,2]$. Our results show that, with a fixed clipping level, the method converges to a neighborhood of the optimal solution with a faster rate than the existing ones. The neighborhood can be balanced against the noise introduced by DP, providing a refined trade-off between convergence speed and privacy guarantees.</p></details> | 60 pages |

Additionally, first-order methods with clipping, such as Clip-SGD, exhibit stronger convergence guarantees than SGD under the $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness assumption, a property observed in many DL tasks. However, the high-probability convergence of Clip-SGD under both assumptions -- heavy-tailed noise and $(L_0,L_1)$-smoothness -- has not been fully addressed in the literature. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by establishing the first high-probability convergence bounds for Clip-SGD applied to convex $(L_0,L_1)$-smooth optimization with heavy-tailed noise. Our analysis extends prior results by recovering known bounds for the deterministic case and the stochastic setting with $L_1 = 0$ as special cases. Notably, our rates avoid exponentially large factors and do not rely on restrictive sub-Gaussian noise assumptions, significantly broadening the applicability of gradient clipping.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Bridging the Task Gap: Multi-Task Adversarial Transferability in CLIP and Its Derivatives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23917v1)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoPatch: Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation by Leveraging Untapped Spatial Knowledge in CLIP](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23098v1)** | 2025-09-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 22 Figures, 11 Tables</p></details> |

Given recent advances in large language models (LLMs), we ask whether they, too, can learn to create. We approach this question through the lens of compositional machine design: a task in which machines are assembled from standardized components to meet functional demands like locomotion or manipulation in a simulated physical environment. To support this investigation, we introduce BesiegeField, a testbed built on the machine-building game Besiege, which enables part-based construction, physical simulation and reward-driven evaluation. Using BesiegeField, we benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs with agentic workflows and identify key capabilities required for success, including spatial reasoning, strategic assembly, and instruction-following. As current open-source models fall short, we explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a path to improvement: we curate a cold-start dataset, conduct RL finetuning experiments, and highlight open challenges at the intersection of language, machine design, and physical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>75 pa...</summary><p>75 pages, 31 figures, Project Page: https://besiegefield.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Information Gain-based Policy Optimization: A Simple and Effective Approach for Multi-Turn LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14967v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents are increasingly trained with reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance their ability to interact with external environments through tool use, particularly in search-based settings that require multi-turn reasoning and knowledge acquisition. However, existing approaches typically rely on outcome-based rewards that are only provided at the final answer. This reward sparsity becomes particularly problematic in multi-turn settings, where long trajectories exacerbate two critical issues: (i) advantage collapse, where all rollouts receive identical rewards and provide no useful learning signals, and (ii) lack of fine-grained credit assignment, where dependencies between turns are obscured, especially in long-horizon tasks. In this paper, we propose Information Gain-based Policy Optimization (IGPO), a simple yet effective RL framework that provides dense and intrinsic supervision for multi-turn agent training. IGPO models each interaction turn as an incremental process of acquiring information about the ground truth, and defines turn-level rewards as the marginal increase in the policy's probability of producing the correct answer. Unlike prior process-level reward approaches that depend on external reward models or costly Monte Carlo estimation, IGPO derives intrinsic rewards directly from the model's own belief updates. These intrinsic turn-level rewards are combined with outcome-level supervision to form dense reward trajectories. Extensive experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks demonstrate that IGPO consistently outperforms strong baselines in multi-turn scenarios, achieving higher accuracy and improved sample efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14959v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed \emph{online} via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs \emph{in training}. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Edge devices are limited in computing power and memory, making model efficiency and compression essential. In this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement learning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an efficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the detector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset collected in diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in real-world navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing module, extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input, which are then passed to an RL policy to control goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results show that the student model achieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy per inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5, while keeping the same performance as the teacher model. EdgeNavMamba also maintains high detection accuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while reducing parameters by 31% compared to the baseline. In the MiniWorld simulator, the navigation policy achieves over 90% success across environments of varying complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 11th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (IEEE EdgeCom 2025)</p></details> |
| **[LaSeR: Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14943v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a core paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). To address the lack of verification signals at test time, prior studies incorporate the training of model's self-verification capability into the standard RLVR process, thereby unifying reasoning and verification capabilities within a single LLM. However, previous practice requires the LLM to sequentially generate solutions and self-verifications using two separate prompt templates, which significantly reduces efficiency. In this work, we theoretically reveal that the closed-form solution to the RL objective of self-verification can be reduced to a remarkably simple form: the true reasoning reward of a solution is equal to its last-token self-rewarding score, which is computed as the difference between the policy model's next-token log-probability assigned to any pre-specified token at the solution's last token and a pre-calculated constant, scaled by the KL coefficient. Based on this insight, we propose LaSeR (Reinforcement Learning with Last-Token Self-Rewarding), an algorithm that simply augments the original RLVR loss with a MSE loss that aligns the last-token self-rewarding scores with verifier-based reasoning rewards, jointly optimizing the reasoning and self-rewarding capabilities of LLMs. The optimized self-rewarding scores can be utilized in both training and testing to enhance model performance. Notably, our algorithm derives these scores from the predicted next-token probability distribution of the last token immediately after generation, incurring only the minimal extra cost of one additional token inference. Experiments show that our method not only improves the model's reasoning performance but also equips it with remarkable self-rewarding capability, thereby boosting its inference-time scaling performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress.

In this work, we present VT-Refine, a visuo-tactile policy learning framework that combines real-world demonstrations, high-fidelity tactile simulation, and reinforcement learning to tackle precise, contact-rich bimanual assembly. We begin by training a diffusion policy on a small set of demonstrations using synchronized visual and tactile inputs. This policy is then transferred to a simulated digital twin equipped with simulated tactile sensors and further refined via large-scale reinforcement learning to enhance robustness and generalization. To enable accurate sim-to-real transfer, we leverage high-resolution piezoresistive tactile sensors that provide normal force signals and can be realistically modeled in parallel using GPU-accelerated simulation. Experimental results show that VT-Refine improves assembly performance in both simulation and the real world by increasing data diversity and enabling more effective policy fine-tuning.

| **[Beyond Two-Stage Training: Cooperative SFT and RL for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06948v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective in incentivizing the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), but suffers from severe efficiency challenges due to its trial-and-error nature. While the common practice employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a warm-up stage for RL, this decoupled two-stage approach suffers from catastrophic forgetting: second-stage RL gradually loses SFT-acquired behaviors and inefficiently explores new patterns. This study introduces a novel method for learning reasoning models that employs bilevel optimization to facilitate better cooperation between these training paradigms. By conditioning the SFT objective on the optimal RL policy, our approach enables SFT to meta-learn how to guide RL's optimization process. During training, the lower level performs RL updates while simultaneously receiving SFT supervision, and the upper level explicitly maximizes the cooperative gain-the performance advantage of joint SFT-RL training over RL alone. Empirical evaluations on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines and achieves a better balance between effectiveness and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hard-Label Black-Box Evasion Attack against ML-based Malicious Traffic Detection Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14906v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning (ML)-based malicious traffic detection is a promising security paradigm. It outperforms rule-based traditional detection by identifying various advanced attacks. However, the robustness of these ML models is largely unexplored, thereby allowing attackers to craft adversarial traffic examples that evade detection. Existing evasion attacks typically rely on overly restrictive conditions (e.g., encrypted protocols, Tor, or specialized setups), or require detailed prior knowledge of the target (e.g., training data and model parameters), which is impractical in realistic black-box scenarios. The feasibility of a hard-label black-box evasion attack (i.e., applicable across diverse tasks and protocols without internal target insights) thus remains an open challenge. To this end, we develop NetMasquerade, which leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to manipulate attack flows to mimic benign traffic and evade detection. Specifically, we establish a tailored pre-trained model called Traffic-BERT, utilizing a network-specialized tokenizer and an attention mechanism to extract diverse benign traffic patterns. Subsequently, we integrate Traffic-BERT into the RL framework, allowing NetMasquerade to effectively manipulate malicious packet sequences based on benign traffic patterns with minimal modifications. Experimental results demonstrate that NetMasquerade enables both brute-force and stealthy attacks to evade 6 existing detection methods under 80 attack scenarios, achieving over 96.65% attack success rate. Notably, it can evade the methods that are either empirically or certifiably robust against existing evasion attacks. Finally, NetMasquerade achieves low-latency adversarial traffic generation, demonstrating its practicality in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the widespread success of this paradigm, much of the literature has been devoted to disentangling truly novel behaviors that emerge during RL but are not present in the base models. In our work, we approach this question from a different angle, instead asking whether comparable reasoning capabilites can be elicited from base models at inference time by pure sampling, without any additional training. Inspired by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques for sampling from sharpened distributions, we propose a simple iterative sampling algorithm leveraging the base models' own likelihoods. Over different base models, we show that our algorithm offers substantial boosts in reasoning that nearly match and even outperform those from RL on a wide variety of single-shot tasks, including MATH500, HumanEval, and GPQA. Moreover, our sampler avoids the collapse in diversity over multiple samples that is characteristic of RL-posttraining. Crucially, our method does not require training, curated datasets, or a verifier, suggesting broad applicability beyond easily verifiable domains.</p></details> |  |

However, vendor documentation is often unavailable at test time. It is either misplaced, mismatched, poorly formatted, or incomplete, which makes schema mapping challenging. We introduce a reinforcement learning agent that can self-improve without labeled examples or model weight updates. During inference, the agent: 1) Identifies ambiguous field-mapping attempts. 2) Generates targeted web-search queries to gather external evidence. 3) Applies a confidence-based reward to iteratively refine its mappings. To demonstrate this concept, we converted Microsoft Defender for Endpoint logs into a common schema. Our method increased mapping accuracy from 56.4\%(LLM-only) to 72.73\%(RAG) to 93.94\% over 100 iterations using GPT-4o. At the same time, it reduced the number of low-confidence mappings requiring expert review by 85\%. This new approach provides an evidence-driven, transparent method for solving future industry problems, paving the way for more robust, accountable, scalable, efficient, flexible, adaptable, and collaborative solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Strategyproof Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09561v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in settings where multiple labelers may strategically misreport feedback to steer the learned policy toward their own preferences. We show that existing RLHF algorithms, including recent pluralistic methods, are not strategyproof, and that even a single strategic labeler can cause arbitrarily large misalignment with social welfare. Moreover, we prove that, in the worst case, any strategyproof RLHF algorithm must perform $k$-times worse than the optimal policy, where $k$ is the number of labelers. This suggests a fundamental trade-off between incentive alignment (ensuring labelers report truthfully) and policy alignment (maximizing social welfare). To address this, we propose the Pessimistic Median of MLEs algorithm, which, under appropriate policy coverage assumptions, is approximately strategyproof and converges to the optimal policy as the number of labelers and samples increases. Our results apply to both contextual bandits and Markov decision processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Thinker: Learning to Think Fast and Slow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21097v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be improved by applying Reinforcement Learning (RL) to question-answering (QA) tasks in areas such as math and coding. With a long context length, LLMs may learn to perform search, as indicated by the self-correction behavior observed in DeepSeek R1. However, this search behavior is often imprecise and lacks confidence, resulting in long, redundant responses and highlighting deficiencies in intuition and verification. Inspired by the Dual Process Theory in psychology, we introduce a simple modification to the QA task that includes four stages: Fast Thinking, where the LLM must answer within a strict token budget; Verification, where the model evaluates its initial response; Slow Thinking, where it refines the initial response with more deliberation; and Summarization, where it distills the refinement from the previous stage into precise steps. Our proposed task improves average accuracy from 25.6% to 27.3% for Qwen2.5-1.5B, and from 45.9% to 51.0% for DeepSeek-R1-Qwen-1.5B. Notably, for Qwen2.5-1.5B, the Fast Thinking mode alone achieves 25.2% accuracy using fewer than 1000 tokens, demonstrating substantial inference efficiency gains. These findings suggest that intuition and deliberative reasoning are distinct, complementary systems benefiting from targeted training. Additionally, we have open-sourced both the trained models and the source code.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Our algorithm, based on constraint solving, learns minimal stochastic reward machines from the explorations of a reinforcement learning agent. This algorithm can easily be paired with existing reinforcement learning algorithms for reward machines and guarantees to converge to an optimal policy in the limit.

We present RL-100, a real-world reinforcement learning training framework built on diffusion visuomotor policies trained bu supervised learning. RL-100 introduces a three-stage pipeline. First, imitation learning leverages human priors. Second, iterative offline reinforcement learning uses an Offline Policy Evaluation procedure, abbreviated OPE, to gate PPO-style updates that are applied in the denoising process for conservative and reliable improvement. Third, online reinforcement learning eliminates residual failure modes. An additional lightweight consistency distillation head compresses the multi-step sampling process in diffusion into a single-step policy, enabling high-frequency control with an order-of-magnitude reduction in latency while preserving task performance. The framework is task-, embodiment-, and representation-agnostic and supports both 3D point clouds and 2D RGB inputs, a variety of robot platforms, and both single-step and action-chunk policies. We evaluate RL-100 on seven real-robot tasks spanning dynamic rigid-body control, such as Push-T and Agile Bowling, fluids and granular pouring, deformable cloth folding, precise dexterous unscrewing, and multi-stage orange juicing. RL-100 attains 100\% success across evaluated trials for a total of 900 out of 900 episodes, including up to 250 out of 250 consecutive trials on one task. The method achieves near-human teleoperation or better time efficiency and demonstrates multi-hour robustness with uninterrupted operation lasting up to two hours.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://lei-kun.github.io/RL-100/</p></details> |

Despite the success of large language models and vision language models based on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) in planning tasks, they continue facing challenges in performing long-horizon manipulation tasks in complex real-world environments, owing to their restricted common sense and reasoning capabilities. Considering that aligning general-purpose vision language models to robotic planning tasks via supervised fine-tuning suffers from poor generalization and insufficient physical understanding, we propose RoboGPT-R1, a two-stage fine-tuning framework for embodied planning. In this framework, supervised training acquires foundational knowledge through expert sequences, followed by RL to address the model's shortcomings in visual-spatial understanding and reasoning. To achieve physical understanding and action sequence consistency in multi-step reasoning tasks, we design a rule-based reward function that simultaneously considers long-horizon performance and action constraint in the environment. The reasoning model, trained on Qwen2.5-VL-3B, significantly outperforms the larger-scale model, GPT-4o-mini, by 21.33% and surpasses other work trained on Qwen2.5-VL-7B by 20.33% on the EmbodiedBench benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[SimKO: Simple Pass@K Policy Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14807v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, prevailing RLVR methods exhibit a systematic bias toward exploitation over exploration, as evidenced by improved pass@1 but reduced pass@K (K>1) performance. To understand this issue, we analyze training dynamics of RLVR methods by tracking the token-level probability distributions over vocabulary candidates. Our analysis reveals a consistent probability concentration effect where the top-1 candidate increasingly accumulates probability mass and suppresses that of other candidates. More importantly, stronger over-concentration correlates with worse pass@K performance. Inspired by this finding, we propose Simple Pass@K Optimization (SimKO), a method designed to mitigate the over-concentration issue, thereby encouraging exploration. SimKO operates in an asymmetrical manner. For verified-correct responses, it boosts the probabilities of the top-K candidates. For verified-incorrect responses, it applies stronger penalties to the top-1 candidate. We observe that this asymmetric design is particularly effective at mitigating over-concentration when applied at tokens with high entropy. Across various math and logical-reasoning benchmarks, SimKO consistently yields higher pass@K for a wide range of K, providing a simple way to improve RLVR's exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (20 pages, 10 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/simko/)</p></details> |

While end-to-end vision-based methods promise broader applicability, no system to date simultaneously achieves full sim-to-real transfer, onboard execution, and champion-level performance. In this work, we present SkyDreamer, to the best of our knowledge, the first end-to-end vision-based ADR policy that maps directly from pixel-level representations to motor commands. SkyDreamer builds on informed Dreamer, a model-based reinforcement learning approach where the world model decodes to privileged information only available during training. By extending this concept to end-to-end vision-based ADR, the world model effectively functions as an implicit state and parameter estimator, greatly improving interpretability. SkyDreamer runs fully onboard without external aid, resolves visual ambiguities by tracking progress using the state decoded from the world model's hidden state, and requires no extrinsic camera calibration, enabling rapid deployment across different drones without retraining. Real-world experiments show that SkyDreamer achieves robust, high-speed flight, executing tight maneuvers such as an inverted loop, a split-S and a ladder, reaching speeds of up to 21 m/s and accelerations of up to 6 g. It further demonstrates a non-trivial visual sim-to-real transfer by operating on poor-quality segmentation masks, and exhibits robustness to battery depletion by accurately estimating the maximum attainable motor RPM and adjusting its flight path in real-time. These results highlight SkyDreamer's adaptability to important aspects of the reality gap, bringing robustness while still achieving extremely high-speed, agile flight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Neural Descriptor Fields for Learning Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14768v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world dexterous manipulation often encounters unexpected errors and disturbances, which can lead to catastrophic failures, such as dropping the manipulated object. To address this challenge, we focus on the problem of catching a falling object while it remains within grasping range and, importantly, resetting the system to a configuration favorable for resuming the primary manipulation task. We propose Contact-Aware Dynamic Recovery (CADRE), a reinforcement learning framework that incorporates a Neural Descriptor Field (NDF)-inspired module to extract implicit contact features. Compared to methods that rely solely on object pose or point cloud input, NDFs can directly reason about finger-object correspondence and adapt to different object geometries. Our experiments show that incorporating contact features improves training efficiency, enhances convergence performance for RL training, and ultimately leads to more successful recoveries. Additionally, we demonstrate that CADRE can generalize zero-shot to unseen objects with different geometries.</p></details> |  |

To address this limitation, we propose AutoRubric-R1V, a framework that integrates RLVR with process-level supervision through automatically collected rubric-based generative rewards. Our key innovation lies in a scalable self-aggregation method that distills consistent reasoning checkpoints from successful trajectories, enabling problem-specific rubric construction without human annotation or stronger teacher models. By jointly leveraging rubric-based and outcome rewards, AutoRubric-R1V achieves state-of-the-art performance on six multimodal reasoning benchmarks and substantially improves reasoning faithfulness in dedicated evaluations.</p></details> |  |

We evaluated INDAGO-Nexus on three DRL agents: humanoid walker, self-driving car, and parking agent.

| **[Cognitive-Aligned Spatio-Temporal Large Language Models For Next Point-of-Interest Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14702v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation task aims to predict the users' immediate next destinations based on their preferences and historical check-ins, holding significant value in location-based services. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in recommender systems, which treat the next POI prediction in a generative manner. However, these LLMs, pretrained primarily on vast corpora of unstructured text, lack the native understanding of structured geographical entities and sequential mobility patterns required for next POI prediction tasks. Moreover, in industrial-scale POI prediction applications, incorporating world knowledge and alignment of human cognition, such as seasons, weather conditions, holidays, and users' profiles (such as habits, occupation, and preferences), can enhance the user experience while improving recommendation performance. To address these issues, we propose CoAST (Cognitive-Aligned Spatial-Temporal LLMs), a framework employing natural language as an interface, allowing for the incorporation of world knowledge, spatio-temporal trajectory patterns, profiles, and situational information. Specifically, CoAST mainly comprises of 2 stages: (1) Recommendation Knowledge Acquisition through continued pretraining on the enriched spatial-temporal trajectory data of the desensitized users; (2) Cognitive Alignment to align cognitive judgments with human preferences using enriched training data through Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase. Extensive offline experiments on various real-world datasets and online experiments deployed in "Guess Where You Go" of AMAP App homepage demonstrate the effectiveness of CoAST.</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Offline Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20030v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by the recent successes of Inverse Optimization (IO) across various application domains, we propose a novel offline Reinforcement Learning (ORL) algorithm for continuous state and action spaces, leveraging the convex loss function called ``sub-optimality loss" from the IO literature. To mitigate the distribution shift commonly observed in ORL problems, we further employ a robust and non-causal Model Predictive Control (MPC) expert steering a nominal model of the dynamics using in-hindsight information stemming from the model mismatch. Unlike the existing literature, our robust MPC expert enjoys an exact and tractable convex reformulation. In the second part of this study, we show that the IO hypothesis class, trained by the proposed convex loss function, enjoys ample expressiveness and achieves competitive performance comparing with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in the low-data regime of the MuJoCo benchmark while utilizing three orders of magnitude fewer parameters, thereby requiring significantly fewer computational resources. To facilitate the reproducibility of our results, we provide an open-source package implementing the proposed algorithms and the experiments.</p></details> | preprint |

Through mathematical analysis, we reveal that standard SFT gradients implicitly encode a problematic reward structure that may severely restrict the generalization capabilities of model. To rectify this, we propose Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT), stabilizing gradient updates for each token by dynamically rescaling the objective function with the probability of this token. Remarkably, this single-line code change significantly outperforms standard SFT across multiple challenging benchmarks and base models, demonstrating greatly improved generalization. Additionally, our approach shows competitive results in offline RL settings, offering an effective yet simpler alternative. This work bridges theoretical insight and practical solutions, substantially advancing SFT performance. The code will be available at https://github.com/yongliang-wu/DFT.</p></details> | 14 pages, 3 figures |
| **[An Efficient Rubric-based Generative Verifier for Search-Augmented LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14660v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Search augmentation empowers Large Language Models with retrieval capabilities to overcome the limitations imposed by static parameters. Recently, Reinforcement Learning leverages tailored reward signals as a viable technique to enhance LLMs performing tasks involving search. However, existing reward modeling for search-augmented LLMs faces several limitations. Rule-based rewards, such as Exact Match, are verifiable but fragile to variations in expression and cannot be applied to long-form workloads. In contrast, generative rewards improve robustness, but designing verifiable and stable rewards for long-form workloads in dynamic corpora remains challenging and also incurs high computational costs. In this paper, we propose a unified and verifiable paradigm, "nugget-as-rubric", which treats atomic information points as structured evaluation criteria for different search-augmentation workloads. Short-form tasks correspond to a single rubric, whereas long-form tasks expand to multiple rubrics aligned with the question's information needs. To support long-form settings, we design an automatic rubric construction pipeline based on query rewriting, which can automatically retrieve passages relevant to each question and extract rubrics from them, both from static corpora and from dynamic online web content. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Search-Gen-V}, a 4B-parameter efficient generative verifier under our proposed verifiable paradigm, which is trained via the idea of distillation and a two-stage strategy. Experimental results show that Search-Gen-V achieves strong verification accuracy across different workloads, making it a scalable, robust, and efficient verifiable reward constructor for search-augmented LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Bidding Games: Reinforcement Learning for MEV Extraction on Polygon Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14642v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In blockchain networks, the strategic ordering of transactions within blocks has emerged as a significant source of profit extraction, known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). The transition from spam-based Priority Gas Auctions to structured auction mechanisms like Polygon Atlas has transformed MEV extraction from public bidding wars into sealed-bid competitions under extreme time constraints. While this shift reduces network congestion, it introduces complex strategic challenges where searchers must make optimal bidding decisions within a sub-second window without knowledge of competitor behavior or presence. Traditional game-theoretic approaches struggle in this high-frequency, partially observable environment due to their reliance on complete information and static equilibrium assumptions. We present a reinforcement learning framework for MEV extraction on Polygon Atlas and make three contributions: (1) A novel simulation environment that accurately models the stochastic arrival of arbitrage opportunities and probabilistic competition in Atlas auctions; (2) A PPO-based bidding agent optimized for real-time constraints, capable of adaptive strategy formulation in continuous action spaces while maintaining production-ready inference speeds; (3) Empirical validation demonstrating our history-conditioned agent captures 49\% of available profits when deployed alongside existing searchers and 81\% when replacing the market leader, significantly outperforming static bidding strategies. Our work establishes that reinforcement learning provides a critical advantage in high-frequency MEV environments where traditional optimization methods fail, offering immediate value for industrial participants and protocol designers alike.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATGen: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Test Case Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14635v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, yet their outputs often contain subtle bugs, for which effective test cases are a critical bottleneck. Existing test generation methods, whether based on prompting or supervised fine-tuning, rely on static datasets. This imposes a ``fixed-difficulty ceiling'', fundamentally limiting their ability to uncover novel or more complex bugs beyond their training scope. To overcome this, we introduce ATGen, a framework that trains a test case generator via adversarial reinforcement learning. ATGen pits a test generator against an adversarial code generator that continuously crafts harder bugs to evade the current policy. This dynamic loop creates a curriculum of increasing difficulty challenging current policy. The test generator is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) to jointly maximize ``Output Accuracy'' and ``Attack Success'', enabling it to learn a progressively stronger policy that breaks the fixed-difficulty ceiling of static training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ATGen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. We further validate its practical utility, showing it serves as both a more effective filter for Best-of-N inference and a higher-quality reward source for training code generation models. Our work establishes a new, dynamic paradigm for improving the reliability of LLM-generated code.</p></details> |  |
| **[MR.Rec: Synergizing Memory and Reasoning for Personalized Recommendation Assistant with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14629v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems faces key challenges in delivering deep personalization and intelligent reasoning, especially for interactive scenarios. Current methods are often constrained by limited context windows and single-turn reasoning, hindering their ability to capture dynamic user preferences and proactively reason over recommendation contexts. To address these limitations, we propose MR.Rec, a novel framework that synergizes memory and reasoning for LLM-based recommendations. To achieve personalization, we develop a comprehensive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that efficiently indexes and retrieves relevant external memory to enhance LLM personalization capabilities. Furthermore, to enable the synergy between memory and reasoning, our RAG system goes beyond conventional query-based retrieval by integrating reasoning enhanced memory retrieval. Finally, we design a reinforcement learning framework that trains the LLM to autonomously learn effective strategies for both memory utilization and reasoning refinement. By combining dynamic memory retrieval with adaptive reasoning, this approach ensures more accurate, context-aware, and highly personalized recommendations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MR.Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics, validating its efficacy in delivering intelligent and personalized recommendations. We will release code and data upon paper notification.</p></details> |  |
| **[RLAIF-SPA: Optimizing LLM-based Emotional Speech Synthesis via RLAIF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14628v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-To-Speech synthesis has achieved near-human quality in neutral speech, but emotional expressiveness remains a challenge. Existing methods often rely on costly emotion annotations or optimize indirect objectives that fail to capture the emotional expressiveness and perceptual naturalness of speech, leading to generated speech that is accurate but emotionally flat. To address these challenges, we propose the RLAIF-SPA framework, incorporating a Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) mechanism to employ Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Large Language Model (LLM) techniques to respectively judge semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional label alignment as a direct reward for emotional expressiveness and intelligibility optimization. Specifically, it leverages Prosodic Label Alignment to enhance expressive quality by jointly considering semantic accuracy and prosodic-emotional alignment along four fine-grained dimensions: Structure, Emotion, Speed, and Tone. In addition, it incorporates Semantic Accuracy Feedback to ensure the generation of clear and accurate speech. Experiments on the Libri Speech dataset show that RLAIF-SPA outperforms Chat-TTS, with a 26.1% reduction in WER, a 9.1% increase in SIM-O, and over 10% improvement in human evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-driven Number Sequence Calculation: Enhancing the inductive Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14620v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) make remarkable progress in reasoning tasks. Among different reasoning modes, inductive reasoning, due to its better alignment with human learning, attracts increasing interest. However, research on inductive reasoning faces certain challenges. First, existing inductive data mostly focuses on superficial regularities while lacking more complex internal patterns. Second, current works merely prompt LLMs or finetune on simple prompt-response pairs, but do not provide precise thinking processes nor implement difficulty control. Unlike previous work, we address these challenges by introducing \textit{CodeSeq}, a synthetic post-training dataset built from number sequences. We package number sequences into algorithmic problems to discover their general terms, defining a general term generation (GTG) task correspondingly. Our pipeline generates supervised finetuning data by reflecting on failed test cases and incorporating iterative corrections, thereby teaching LLMs to learn autonomous case generation and self-checking. Additionally, it leverages reinforcement learning with a novel Case-Synergy Solvability Scaling Reward based on both solvability, estimated from the problem pass rate, and the success rate of self-directed case generation, enabling models to learn more effectively from both successes and failures. Experimental results show that the models trained with \textit{CodeSeq} improve on various reasoning tasks and can preserve the models' OOD performance.</p></details> |  |

Although retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) achieves significant advances in this task by combining knowledge-base querying, it still struggles with the quality of multimodal queries and the relevance of retrieved results. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel three-stage method, termed Wiki-PRF, including Processing, Retrieval and Filtering stages. The processing stage dynamically invokes visual tools to extract precise multimodal information for retrieval. The retrieval stage integrates visual and text features to achieve multimodal knowledge retrieval. The filtering stage performs relevance filtering and concentration on retrieval results. To this end, we introduce a visual language model trained with answer accuracy and format consistency as reward signals via a reinforcement learning manner. This enhances the model's reasoning, tool invocation for accurate queries, and filtering of irrelevant content. Experiments on benchmark datasets (E-VQA and InfoSeek) show significant improvements~(36.0 and 42.8) in answer quality, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

While self-supervised learning (SSL) methods effectively model low-level spatiotemporal patterns, they often struggle to grasp the semantic meaning of these interactions. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) offer powerful contextual reasoning but are computationally expensive for frame-by-frame analysis and lack fine-grained spatial localization. We introduce HyCoVAD, Hybrid Complex Video Anomaly Detection, a hybrid SSL-LLM model that combines a multi-task SSL temporal analyzer with LLM validator. The SSL module is built upon an nnFormer backbone which is a transformer-based model for image segmentation. It is trained with multiple proxy tasks, learns from video frames to identify those suspected of anomaly. The selected frames are then forwarded to the LLM, which enriches the analysis with semantic context by applying structured, rule-based reasoning to validate the presence of anomalies. Experiments on the challenging ComplexVAD dataset show that HyCoVAD achieves a 72.5% frame-level AUC, outperforming existing baselines by 12.5% while reducing LLM computation. We release our interaction anomaly taxonomy, adaptive thresholding protocol, and code to facilitate future research in complex VAD scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>The s...</summary><p>The submission was made prematurely.

However, many approaches struggle with reliability in the target domain, an issue particularly critical in medical image segmentation, where accuracy and anatomical validity are essential. This challenge is further exacerbated in spatio-temporal data, where the lack of temporal consistency can significantly degrade segmentation quality, and particularly in echocardiography, where the presence of artifacts and noise can further hinder segmentation performance. To address these issues, we present RL4Seg3D, an unsupervised domain adaptation framework for 2D + time echocardiography segmentation. RL4Seg3D integrates novel reward functions and a fusion scheme to enhance key landmark precision in its segmentations while processing full-sized input videos. By leveraging reinforcement learning for image segmentation, our approach improves accuracy, anatomical validity, and temporal consistency while also providing, as a beneficial side effect, a robust uncertainty estimator, which can be used at test time to further enhance segmentation performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on over 30,000 echocardiographic videos, showing that it outperforms standard domain adaptation techniques without the need for any labels on the target domain.

While deep learning has advanced automated segmentation, most models remain task-specific, lacking generalizability across modalities and institutions. Vision foundation models (FMs) pretrained on billion-scale natural images offer powerful and transferable representations. However, adapting them to medical imaging faces two key challenges: (1) the ViT backbone of most foundation models still underperform specialized CNNs on medical image segmentation, and (2) the large domain gap between natural and medical images limits transferability. We introduce MedDINOv3, a simple and effective framework for adapting DINOv3 to medical segmentation. We first revisit plain ViTs and design a simple and effective architecture with multi-scale token aggregation. Then, we perform domain-adaptive pretraining on CT-3M, a curated collection of 3.87M axial CT slices, using a multi-stage DINOv3 recipe to learn robust dense features. MedDINOv3 matches or exceeds state-of-the-art performance across four segmentation benchmarks, demonstrating the potential of vision foundation models as unified backbones for medical image segmentation.

| **[Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Content Alignment for Hippocampus Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13075v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models for medical image segmentation often struggle when deployed across different datasets due to domain shifts - variations in both image appearance, known as style, and population-dependent anatomical characteristics, referred to as content. This paper presents a novel unsupervised domain adaptation framework that directly addresses domain shifts encountered in cross-domain hippocampus segmentation from MRI, with specific emphasis on content variations. Our approach combines efficient style harmonisation through z-normalisation with a bidirectional deformable image registration (DIR) strategy. The DIR network is jointly trained with segmentation and discriminator networks to guide the registration with respect to a region of interest and generate anatomically plausible transformations that align source images to the target domain. We validate our approach through comprehensive evaluations on both a synthetic dataset using Morpho-MNIST (for controlled validation of core principles) and three MRI hippocampus datasets representing populations with varying degrees of atrophy. Across all experiments, our method outperforms existing baselines. For hippocampus segmentation, when transferring from young, healthy populations to clinical dementia patients, our framework achieves up to 15% relative improvement in Dice score compared to standard augmentation methods, with the largest gains observed in scenarios with substantial content shift. These results highlight the efficacy of our approach for accurate hippocampus segmentation across diverse populations.</p></details> |  |

We present GenCellAgent, a training-free multi-agent framework that orchestrates specialist segmenters and generalist vision-language models via a planner-executor-evaluator loop (choose tool $\rightarrow$ run $\rightarrow$ quality-check) with long-term memory. The system (i) automatically routes images to the best tool, (ii) adapts on the fly using a few reference images when imaging conditions differ from what a tool expects, (iii) supports text-guided segmentation of organelles not covered by existing models, and (iv) commits expert edits to memory, enabling self-evolution and personalized workflows. Across four cell-segmentation benchmarks, this routing yields a 15.7\% mean accuracy gain over state-of-the-art baselines. On endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria from new datasets, GenCellAgent improves average IoU by 37.6\% over specialist models. It also segments novel objects such as the Golgi apparatus via iterative text-guided refinement, with light human correction further boosting performance. Together, these capabilities provide a practical path to robust, adaptable cellular image segmentation without retraining, while reducing annotation burden and matching user preferences.</p></details> | 43 pages |

| **[J-RAS: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation via Retrieval-Augmented Joint Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09953v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image segmentation, the process of dividing images into meaningful regions, is critical in medical applications for accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease monitoring. Although manual segmentation by healthcare professionals produces precise outcomes, it is time-consuming, costly, and prone to variability due to differences in human expertise. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have been developed to address these limitations by automating segmentation tasks; however, they often require large, annotated datasets that are rarely available in practice and frequently struggle to generalize across diverse imaging conditions due to inter-patient variability and rare pathological cases. In this paper, we propose Joint Retrieval Augmented Segmentation (J-RAS), a joint training method for guided image segmentation that integrates a segmentation model with a retrieval model. Both models are jointly optimized, enabling the segmentation model to leverage retrieved image-mask pairs to enrich its anatomical understanding, while the retrieval model learns segmentation-relevant features beyond simple visual similarity. This joint optimization ensures that retrieval actively contributes meaningful contextual cues to guide boundary delineation, thereby enhancing the overall segmentation performance. We validate J-RAS across multiple segmentation backbones, including U-Net, TransUNet, SAM, and SegFormer, on two benchmark datasets: ACDC and M&Ms, demonstrating consistent improvements. For example, on the ACDC dataset, SegFormer without J-RAS achieves a mean Dice score of 0.8708$\pm$0.042 and a mean Hausdorff Distance (HD) of 1.8130$\pm$2.49, whereas with J-RAS, the performance improves substantially to a mean Dice score of 0.9115$\pm$0.031 and a mean HD of 1.1489$\pm$0.30. These results highlight the method's effectiveness and its generalizability across architectures and datasets.</p></details> |  |

Recent multimodal learning integrates text and images for segmentation, known as referring or text-guided image segmentation. However, common augmentations like rotation and flipping disrupt spatial alignment between image and text, weakening performance. To address this, we propose an early fusion framework that combines text and visual features before augmentation, preserving spatial consistency. We also design a lightweight generator that projects text embeddings into visual space, bridging semantic gaps. Visualization of generated pseudo-images shows accurate region localization. Our method is evaluated on three medical imaging tasks and four segmentation frameworks, achieving state-of-the-art results.

Complex scenario of ultrasound image, in which the coupled interference of internal and external factors is severe, brings a unique challenge for localize the object region automatically and precisely in ultrasound images. In this study, we seek to propose a more general and robust Benchmark Attention Adaptive Framework (BAAF) to assist doctors segment or diagnose lesions and tissues in ultrasound images more quickly and accurately. Different from existing attention schemes, the BAAF consists of a parallel hybrid attention module (PHAM) and an adaptive calibration mechanism (ACM). Specifically, BAAF first coarsely calibrates the input features from the channel and spatial dimensions, and then adaptively selects more robust lesion or tissue characterizations from the coarse-calibrated feature maps. The design of BAAF further optimizes the "what" and "where" focus and selection problems in CNNs and seeks to improve the segmentation accuracy of lesions or tissues in medical ultrasound images. The method is evaluated on four medical ultrasound segmentation tasks, and the adequate experimental results demonstrate the remarkable performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the comparison with existing attention mechanisms also demonstrates the superiority of BAAF. This work provides the possibility for automated medical ultrasound assisted diagnosis and reduces reliance on human accuracy and precision.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures |

This is why we created the Calibration and Uncertainty for multiRater Volume Assessment in multiorgan Segmentation (CURVAS), which highlights the critical role of multiple annotators in establishing a more comprehensive ground truth, emphasizing that segmentation is inherently subjective and that leveraging inter-annotator variability is essential for robust model evaluation. Seven teams participated in the challenge, submitting a variety of DL models evaluated using metrics such as Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Expected Calibration Error (ECE), and Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS). By incorporating consensus and dissensus ground truth, we assess how DL models handle uncertainty and whether their confidence estimates align with true segmentation performance. Our findings reinforce the importance of well-calibrated models, as better calibration is strongly correlated with the quality of the results. Furthermore, we demonstrate that segmentation models trained on diverse datasets and enriched with pre-trained knowledge exhibit greater robustness, particularly in cases deviating from standard anatomical structures. Notably, the best-performing models achieved high DSC and well-calibrated uncertainty estimates. This work underscores the need for multi-annotator ground truth, thorough calibration assessments, and uncertainty-aware evaluations to develop trustworthy and clinically reliable DL-based medical image segmentation models.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This challenge was hosted in MICCAI 2024</p></details> |
| **[DPL: Spatial-Conditioned Diffusion Prototype Enhancement for One-Shot Medical Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12159v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot medical image segmentation faces fundamental challenges in prototype representation due to limited annotated data and significant anatomical variability across patients. Traditional prototype-based methods rely on deterministic averaging of support features, creating brittle representations that fail to capture intra-class diversity essential for robust generalization. This work introduces Diffusion Prototype Learning (DPL), a novel framework that reformulates prototype construction through diffusion-based feature space exploration. DPL models one-shot prototypes as learnable probability distributions, enabling controlled generation of diverse yet semantically coherent prototype variants from minimal labeled data. The framework operates through three core innovations: (1) a diffusion-based prototype enhancement module that transforms single support prototypes into diverse variant sets via forward-reverse diffusion processes, (2) a spatial-aware conditioning mechanism that leverages geometric properties derived from prototype feature statistics, and (3) a conservative fusion strategy that preserves prototype fidelity while maximizing representational diversity. DPL ensures training-inference consistency by using the same diffusion enhancement and fusion pipeline in both phases. This process generates enhanced prototypes that serve as the final representations for similarity calculations, while the diffusion process itself acts as a regularizer. Extensive experiments on abdominal MRI and CT datasets demonstrate significant improvements respectively, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in one-shot medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IVCNZ 2025.

| **[Boosting Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08549v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA). Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network (DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation. Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models, which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data, The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations, we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Uncertainty-Supervised Interpretable and Robust Evidential Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17098v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches. However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions. In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed method can achieve competitive segmentation performance and superior results in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios while significantly improving the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty estimation.

We introduce EEMS, a new model for segmentation, combining an Edge-Aware Enhancement Unit (EAEU) and a Multi-scale Prompt Generation Unit (MSPGU). EAEU enhances edge perception via multi-frequency feature extraction, accurately defining boundaries. MSPGU integrates high-level semantic and low-level spatial features using a prompt-guided approach, ensuring precise target localization. The Dual-Source Adaptive Gated Fusion Unit (DAGFU) merges edge features from EAEU with semantic features from MSPGU, enhancing segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Current methods often struggle with limited structural representation and insufficient contextual modeling, affecting generalization in complex clinical scenarios. We propose the DTEA model, featuring a new skip connection framework with the Semantic Topology Reconfiguration (STR) and Entropic Perturbation Gating (EPG) modules. STR reorganizes multi-scale semantic features into a dynamic hypergraph to better model cross-resolution anatomical dependencies, enhancing structural and semantic representation. EPG assesses channel stability after perturbation and filters high-entropy channels to emphasize clinically important regions and improve spatial attention. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show our framework achieves superior segmentation accuracy and better generalization across various clinical settings.

Some recent works have focused on extending VLMs to open vocabulary single label action classification in videos. However, previous methods fall short in holistic video understanding which requires the ability to simultaneously recognize multiple actions and entities e.g., objects in the video in an open vocabulary setting. We formulate this problem as open vocabulary multilabel video classification and propose a method to adapt a pre-trained VLM such as CLIP to solve this task. We leverage large language models (LLMs) to provide semantic guidance to the VLM about class labels to improve its open vocabulary performance with two key contributions. First, we propose an end-to-end trainable architecture that learns to prompt an LLM to generate soft attributes for the CLIP text-encoder to enable it to recognize novel classes. Second, we integrate a temporal modeling module into CLIP's vision encoder to effectively model the spatio-temporal dynamics of video concepts as well as propose a novel regularized finetuning technique to ensure strong open vocabulary classification performance in the video domain. Our extensive experimentation showcases the efficacy of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ECCV 2024</p></details> |

Although foundation models generally perform well in segmentation tasks, they often struggle to focus on foreground areas in complex, low-contrast backgrounds, where some malignant tumors closely resemble normal organs, complicating contextual differentiation. To address these challenges, we propose the Foreground-Aware Spectrum Segmentation (FASS) framework. First, we introduce a foreground-aware module to amplify the distinction between background and the entire volume space, allowing the model to concentrate more effectively on target areas. Next, a feature-level frequency enhancement module, based on wavelet transform, extracts discriminative high-frequency features to enhance boundary recognition and detail perception. Eventually, we introduce an edge constraint module to preserve geometric continuity in segmentation boundaries. Extensive experiments on multiple medical datasets demonstrate superior performance across all metrics, validating the effectiveness of our framework, particularly in robustness under complex conditions and fine structure recognition. Our framework significantly enhances segmentation of low-contrast images, paving the way for applications in more diverse and complex medical imaging scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeRIS: Decoupling Perception and Cognition for Enhanced Referring Image Segmentation through Loopback Synergy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01738v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a challenging task that aims to segment objects in an image based on natural language expressions. While prior studies have predominantly concentrated on improving vision-language interactions and achieving fine-grained localization, a systematic analysis of the fundamental bottlenecks in existing RIS frameworks remains underexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose DeRIS, a novel framework that decomposes RIS into two key components: perception and cognition. This modular decomposition facilitates a systematic analysis of the primary bottlenecks impeding RIS performance. Our findings reveal that the predominant limitation lies not in perceptual deficiencies, but in the insufficient multi-modal cognitive capacity of current models. To mitigate this, we propose a Loopback Synergy mechanism, which enhances the synergy between the perception and cognition modules, thereby enabling precise segmentation while simultaneously improving robust image-text comprehension. Additionally, we analyze and introduce a simple non-referent sample conversion data augmentation to address the long-tail distribution issue related to target existence judgement in general scenarios. Notably, DeRIS demonstrates inherent adaptability to both non- and multi-referents scenarios without requiring specialized architectural modifications, enhancing its general applicability. The codes and models are available at https://github.com/Dmmm1997/DeRIS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning from Disagreement: A Group Decision Simulation Framework for Robust Medical Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10462v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation annotation suffers from inter-rater variability (IRV) due to differences in annotators' expertise and the inherent blurriness of medical images. Standard approaches that simply average expert labels are flawed, as they discard the valuable clinical uncertainty revealed in disagreements. We introduce a fundamentally new approach with our group decision simulation framework, which works by mimicking the collaborative decision-making process of a clinical panel. Under this framework, an Expert Signature Generator (ESG) learns to represent individual annotator styles in a unique latent space. A Simulated Consultation Module (SCM) then intelligently generates the final segmentation by sampling from this space. This method achieved state-of-the-art results on challenging CBCT and MRI datasets (92.11% and 90.72% Dice scores). By treating expert disagreement as a useful signal instead of noise, our work provides a clear path toward more robust and trustworthy AI systems for healthcare.</p></details> |  |

SAM2 employs a masked autoencoder-pretrained Hierarchical Vision Transformer for multi-scale feature decoding, enabling rapid inference in low-resource settings; however, fine-tuning remains challenging. To address this, SAM2LoRA integrates a low-rank adapter into both the image encoder and mask decoder, requiring fewer than 5\% of the original trainable parameters. Our analysis indicates that for cross-dataset fundus segmentation tasks, a composite loss function combining segmentationBCE, SoftDice, and FocalTversky losses is essential for optimal network tuning. Evaluated on 11 challenging fundus segmentation datasets, SAM2LoRA demonstrates high performance in both blood vessel and optic disc segmentation under cross-dataset training conditions. It achieves Dice scores of up to 0.86 and 0.93 for blood vessel and optic disc segmentation, respectively, and AUC values of up to 0.98 and 0.99, achieving state-of-the-art performance while substantially reducing training overhead.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 2025 International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA)</p></details> |
| **[SaFiRe: Saccade-Fixation Reiteration with Mamba for Referring Image Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10160v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment the target object in an image given a natural language expression. While recent methods leverage pre-trained vision backbones and more training corpus to achieve impressive results, they predominantly focus on simple expressions--short, clear noun phrases like "red car" or "left girl". This simplification often reduces RIS to a key word/concept matching problem, limiting the model's ability to handle referential ambiguity in expressions. In this work, we identify two challenging real-world scenarios: object-distracting expressions, which involve multiple entities with contextual cues, and category-implicit expressions, where the object class is not explicitly stated. To address the challenges, we propose a novel framework, SaFiRe, which mimics the human two-phase cognitive process--first forming a global understanding, then refining it through detail-oriented inspection. This is naturally supported by Mamba's scan-then-update property, which aligns with our phased design and enables efficient multi-cycle refinement with linear complexity. We further introduce aRefCOCO, a new benchmark designed to evaluate RIS models under ambiguous referring expressions. Extensive experiments on both standard and proposed datasets demonstrate the superiority of SaFiRe over state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

In scenarios where optimum handwriting samples are available, whether they be in the form of a single line, a sentence, or an entire page, writer identification algorithms have demonstrated noteworthy levels of accuracy. However, in scenarios where only a limited number of handwritten samples are available, particularly in the form of word images, there is a significant scope for improvement. In this paper, we propose a writer identification system based on an attention-driven Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system is trained utilizing image segments, known as fragments, extracted from word images, employing a pyramid-based strategy. This methodology enables the system to capture a comprehensive representation of the data, encompassing both fine-grained details and coarse features across various levels of abstraction. These extracted fragments serve as the training data for the convolutional network, enabling it to learn a more robust representation compared to traditional convolution-based networks trained on word images. Additionally, the paper explores the integration of an attention mechanism to enhance the representational power of the learned features. The efficacy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated on three benchmark databases, demonstrating its proficiency in writer identification tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited access to handwriting data.</p></details> |  |
| **[OmniSAM: Omnidirectional Segment Anything Model for UDA in Panoramic Semantic Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07098v3)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has emerged as a strong base model in various pinhole imaging segmentation tasks. However, when applying it to $360^\circ$ domain, the significant field-of-view (FoV) gap between pinhole ($70^\circ \times 70^\circ$) and panoramic images ($180^\circ \times 360^\circ$) poses unique challenges. Two major concerns for this application includes 1) inevitable distortion and object deformation brought by the large FoV disparity between domains; 2) the lack of pixel-level semantic understanding that the original SAM2 cannot provide. To address these issues, we propose a novel OmniSAM framework, which makes the first attempt to apply SAM2 for panoramic semantic segmentation. Specifically, to bridge the first gap, OmniSAM first divides the panorama into sequences of patches. These patches are then treated as image sequences in similar manners as in video segmentation tasks. We then leverage the SAM2's memory mechanism to extract cross-patch correspondences that embeds the cross-FoV dependencies, improving feature continuity and the prediction consistency along mask boundaries. For the second gap, OmniSAM fine-tunes the pretrained image encoder and reutilize the mask decoder for semantic prediction. An FoV-based prototypical adaptation module with dynamic pseudo label update mechanism is also introduced to facilitate the alignment of memory and backbone features, thereby improving model generalization ability across different sizes of source models. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that OmniSAM outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by large margins, e.g., 79.06% (+10.22%) on SPin8-to-SPan8, 62.46% (+6.58%) on CS13-to-DP13.</p></details> |  |

CNNs, however, are constrained by limited receptive fields, while Transformers face scalability challenges due to quadratic computational complexity. To over-come these issues, recent studies have explored alternative architectures. The Mamba model, a selective state-space design, achieves near-linear complexity and effectively captures long-range dependencies. Its vision-oriented variant, the Visual State Space (VSS) model, extends these strengths to image feature learning. In parallel, the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) enhanc-es nonlinear expressiveness by replacing fixed activation functions with learnable ones. Moti-vated by these advances, we propose the VSS-Enhanced KAN (VKAN) module, which integrates VSS with the Expanded Field Convolutional KAN (EFC-KAN) as a replacement for Transformer modules, thereby strengthening feature extraction. We further embed VKAN into a U-Net frame-work, resulting in MedVKAN, an efficient medical image segmentation model. Extensive exper-iments on five public datasets demonstrate that MedVKAN achieves state-of-the-art performance on four datasets and ranks second on the remaining one. These results underscore the effective-ness of combining Mamba and KAN while introducing a novel and computationally efficient feature extraction framework.

However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval - HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment. Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.</p></details> | Under Review |

While the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) has shown remarkable success in video object segmentation by leveraging temporal cues, its direct application to 3D medical images faces two fundamental domain gaps: 1) the bidirectional anatomical continuity between slices contrasts sharply with the unidirectional temporal flow in videos, and 2) precise boundary delineation, crucial for morphological analysis, is often underexplored in video tasks. To bridge these gaps, we propose SAM2-3dMed, an adaptation of SAM2 for 3D medical imaging. Our framework introduces two key innovations: 1) a Slice Relative Position Prediction (SRPP) module explicitly models bidirectional inter-slice dependencies by guiding SAM2 to predict the relative positions of different slices in a self-supervised manner; 2) a Boundary Detection (BD) module enhances segmentation accuracy along critical organ and tissue boundaries. Extensive experiments on three diverse medical datasets (the Lung, Spleen, and Pancreas in the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset) demonstrate that SAM2-3dMed significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in segmentation overlap and boundary precision. Our approach not only advances 3D medical image segmentation performance but also offers a general paradigm for adapting video-centric foundation models to spatial volumetric data.</p></details> |  |

Edge devices are limited in computing power and memory, making model efficiency and compression essential. In this work, we propose EdgeNavMamba, a reinforcement learning-based framework for goal-directed navigation using an efficient Mamba object detection model. To train and evaluate the detector, we introduce a custom shape detection dataset collected in diverse indoor settings, reflecting visual cues common in real-world navigation. The object detector serves as a pre-processing module, extracting bounding boxes (BBOX) from visual input, which are then passed to an RL policy to control goal-oriented navigation. Experimental results show that the student model achieved a reduction of 67% in size, and up to 73% in energy per inference on edge devices of NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano and Raspberry Pi 5, while keeping the same performance as the teacher model. EdgeNavMamba also maintains high detection accuracy in MiniWorld and IsaacLab simulators while reducing parameters by 31% compared to the baseline. In the MiniWorld simulator, the navigation policy achieves over 90% success across environments of varying complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 11th IEEE International Conference on Edge Computing and Scalable Cloud (IEEE EdgeCom 2025)</p></details> |

However, their success rate drops significantly when faced with object concepts outside the training data, such as unseen object descriptions and textures in the dataset. To address this, we propose a novel agentic framework, VLA^2, which leverages OpenVLA as the execution backbone and effectively leverages external modules such as web retrieval and object detection to provide visual and textual knowledge about target objects to the VLA. This approach mitigates generalization failure when handling out-of-distribution objects. Based on the LIBERO simulation environment, we introduced novel objects and object descriptions to construct a new evaluation benchmark with three difficulty levels to test the effectiveness of our method. Our framework successfully outperformed the current state-of-the-art models on our designed hard-level generalization benchmark. Compared to the standalone OpenVLA baseline, VLA^2 achieves a 44.2% improvement in the success rate in the hard-level benchmark and an average improvement of 20.2% in all customized environments without any performance degradation on in-domain tasks.

| **[CoT-PL: Visual Chain-of-Thought Reasoning Meets Pseudo-Labeling for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14792v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) seeks to recognize and localize object categories beyond those seen during training. Recent approaches typically leverage vision-language models (VLMs) to generate pseudo-labels using image-text alignment, allowing detectors to generalize to unseen classes without explicit supervision. However, these methods depend heavily on direct image-text matching, neglecting the intermediate reasoning steps essential for interpreting semantically complex scenes. This results in limited robustness when confronted with crowded or occluded visual contexts. In this paper, we introduce CoT-PL, a new framework that employs structured visual chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into the pseudo-labeling process. CoT-PL decomposes object understanding into three interpretable steps: (1) region perception even for unseen objects, (2) category recognition via zero-shot reasoning, and (3) background grounding to separate semantically complex objects. Crucially, the third step naturally motivates our contrastive background learning (CBL) that uses the pre-computed background cues as negatives to promote feature disentanglement between objects and background. In this way, CoT reasoning and CBL form an integrated pipeline tailored to robust pseudo-labeling in crowded or occluded scenes. Notably, in these two settings, our novel-class pseudo-label quality achieves relative improvements of 103.4% and 168.4% over the best prior, respectively. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that CoT-PL achieves +7.7 AP50 on open-vocabulary COCO and +2.9 mask AP on LVIS for novel classes, setting a new state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 13 Figures, 12 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module for Multi-Scale Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14726v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent object detection methods have made remarkable progress by leveraging attention mechanisms to improve feature discriminability. However, most existing approaches are confined to refining single-layer or fusing dual-layer features, overlooking the rich inter-layer dependencies across multi-scale representations. This limits their ability to capture comprehensive contextual information essential for detecting objects with large scale variations. In this paper, we propose a novel Cross-Layer Feature Self-Attention Module (CFSAM), which holistically models both local and global dependencies within multi-scale feature maps. CFSAM consists of three key components: a convolutional local feature extractor, a Transformer-based global modeling unit that efficiently captures cross-layer interactions, and a feature fusion mechanism to restore and enhance the original representations. When integrated into the SSD300 framework, CFSAM significantly boosts detection performance, achieving 78.6% mAP on PASCAL VOC (vs. 75.5% baseline) and 52.1% mAP on COCO (vs. 43.1% baseline), outperforming existing attention modules. Moreover, the module accelerates convergence during training without introducing substantial computational overhead. Our work highlights the importance of explicit cross-layer attention modeling in advancing multi-scale object detection.</p></details> |  |

A key limitation of existing VLMs lies in their inaccurate visual grounding of infographic elements, including charts and human-recognizable objects (HROs) such as icons and images. However, chart understanding often requires identifying relevant elements and reasoning over them. To address this limitation, we introduce InfoDet, a dataset designed to support the development of accurate object detection models for charts and HROs in infographics.

While deep learning-based object detectors have achieved impressive performance, they remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks, particularly those involving universal perturbations. In this work, we propose a minimally distorted universal adversarial attack tailored for video object detection, which leverages nuclear norm regularization to promote structured perturbations concentrated in the background. To optimize this formulation efficiently, we employ an adaptive, optimistic exponentiated gradient method that enhances both scalability and convergence. Our results demonstrate that the proposed attack outperforms both low-rank projected gradient descent and Frank-Wolfe based attacks in effectiveness while maintaining high stealthiness.

| **[Beat Detection as Object Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14391v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent beat and downbeat tracking models (e.g., RNNs, TCNs, Transformers) output frame-level activations. We propose reframing this task as object detection, where beats and downbeats are modeled as temporal "objects." Adapting the FCOS detector from computer vision to 1D audio, we replace its original backbone with WaveBeat's temporal feature extractor and add a Feature Pyramid Network to capture multi-scale temporal patterns. The model predicts overlapping beat/downbeat intervals with confidence scores, followed by non-maximum suppression (NMS) to select final predictions. This NMS step serves a similar role to DBNs in traditional trackers, but is simpler and less heuristic. Evaluated on standard music datasets, our approach achieves competitive results, showing that object detection techniques can effectively model musical beats with minimal adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Falcon offers a unified, prompt-based paradigm that effectively executes comprehensive and complex remote sensing tasks. Falcon demonstrates powerful understanding and reasoning abilities at the image, region, and pixel levels. Specifically, given simple natural language instructions and remote sensing images, Falcon can produce impressive results in text form across 14 distinct tasks, i.e., image classification, object detection, segmentation, image captioning, and etc. To facilitate Falcon's training and empower its representation capacity to encode rich spatial and semantic information, we developed Falcon_SFT, a large-scale, multi-task, instruction-tuning dataset in the field of remote sensing. The Falcon_SFT dataset consists of approximately 78 million high-quality data samples, covering 5.6 million multi-spatial resolution and multi-view remote sensing images with diverse instructions. It features hierarchical annotations and undergoes manual sampling verification to ensure high data quality and reliability. Extensive comparative experiments are conducted, which verify that Falcon achieves remarkable performance over 67 datasets and 14 tasks, despite having only 0.7B parameters. We release the complete dataset, code, and model weights at https://github.com/TianHuiLab/Falcon, hoping to help further develop the open-source community.</p></details> |  |
| **[ELASTIC: Efficient Once For All Iterative Search for Object Detection on Microcontrollers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21999v2)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying high-performance object detectors on TinyML platforms poses significant challenges due to tight hardware constraints and the modular complexity of modern detection pipelines. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) offers a path toward automation, but existing methods either restrict optimization to individual modules, sacrificing cross-module synergy, or require global searches that are computationally intractable. We propose ELASTIC (Efficient Once for AlL IterAtive Search for ObjecT DetectIon on MiCrocontrollers), a unified, hardware-aware NAS framework that alternates optimization across modules (e.g., backbone, neck, and head) in a cyclic fashion. ELASTIC introduces a novel Population Passthrough mechanism in evolutionary search that retains high-quality candidates between search stages, yielding faster convergence, up to an 8% final mAP gain, and eliminates search instability observed without population passthrough. In a controlled comparison, empirical results show ELASTIC achieves +4.75% higher mAP and 2x faster convergence than progressive NAS strategies on SVHN, and delivers a +9.09% mAP improvement on PascalVOC given the same search budget. ELASTIC achieves 72.3% mAP on PascalVOC, outperforming MCUNET by 20.9% and TinyissimoYOLO by 16.3%. When deployed on MAX78000/MAX78002 microcontrollers, ELASTICderived models outperform Analog Devices' TinySSD baselines, reducing energy by up to 71.6%, lowering latency by up to 2.4x, and improving mAP by up to 6.99 percentage points across multiple datasets.</p></details> | 8 pages, 7 figures |

Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling, the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition, the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/ucf-ut.</p></details> |  |

The review begins with the most recent release, YOLO26 (or YOLOv26), which introduces key innovations including Distribution Focal Loss (DFL) removal, native NMS-free inference, Progressive Loss Balancing (ProgLoss), Small-Target-Aware Label Assignment (STAL), and the MuSGD optimizer for stable training. The progression is then traced through YOLO11, with its hybrid task assignment and efficiency-focused modules; YOLOv8, which advanced with a decoupled detection head and anchor-free predictions; and YOLOv5, which established the modular PyTorch foundation that enabled modern YOLO development. Benchmarking on the MS COCO dataset provides a detailed quantitative comparison of YOLOv5, YOLOv8, YOLO11, and YOLO26 (YOLOv26), alongside cross-comparisons with YOLOv12, YOLOv13, RT-DETR, and DEIM(DETR with Improved Matching). Metrics including precision, recall, F1 score, mean Average Precision, and inference speed are analyzed to highlight trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. Deployment and application perspectives are further discussed, covering export formats, quantization strategies, and real-world use in robotics, agriculture, surveillance, and manufacturing. Finally, the paper identifies challenges and future directions, including dense-scene limitations, hybrid CNN-Transformer integration, open-vocabulary detection, and edge-aware training approaches.

| **[Fusion Meets Diverse Conditions: A High-diversity Benchmark and Baseline for UAV-based Multimodal Object Detection with Condition Cues](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13620v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)-based object detection with visible (RGB) and infrared (IR) images facilitates robust around-the-clock detection, driven by advancements in deep learning techniques and the availability of high-quality dataset. However, the existing dataset struggles to fully capture real-world complexity for limited imaging conditions. To this end, we introduce a high-diversity dataset ATR-UMOD covering varying scenarios, spanning altitudes from 80m to 300m, angles from 0{\deg} to 75{\deg}, and all-day, all-year time variations in rich weather and illumination conditions. Moreover, each RGB-IR image pair is annotated with 6 condition attributes, offering valuable high-level contextual information. To meet the challenge raised by such diverse conditions, we propose a novel prompt-guided condition-aware dynamic fusion (PCDF) to adaptively reassign multimodal contributions by leveraging annotated condition cues. By encoding imaging conditions as text prompts, PCDF effectively models the relationship between conditions and multimodal contributions through a task-specific soft-gating transformation. A prompt-guided condition-decoupling module further ensures the availability in practice without condition annotations. Experiments on ATR-UMOD dataset reveal the effectiveness of PCDF.</p></details> |  |

We adopt a task-oriented perspective to systematically review the applications and advancements of multimodal fusion methods and VLMs in the field of robot vision. For semantic scene understanding tasks, we categorize fusion approaches into encoder-decoder frameworks, attention-based architectures, and graph neural networks. Meanwhile, we also analyze the architectural characteristics and practical implementations of these fusion strategies in key tasks such as simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), 3D object detection, navigation, and manipulation. We compare the evolutionary paths and applicability of VLMs based on large language models (LLMs) with traditional multimodal fusion methods.Additionally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of commonly used datasets, evaluating their applicability and challenges in real-world robotic scenarios. Building on this analysis, we identify key challenges in current research, including cross-modal alignment, efficient fusion, real-time deployment, and domain adaptation. We propose future directions such as self-supervised learning for robust multimodal representations, structured spatial memory and environment modeling to enhance spatial intelligence, and the integration of adversarial robustness and human feedback mechanisms to enable ethically aligned system deployment. Through a comprehensive review, comparative analysis, and forward-looking discussion, we provide a valuable reference for advancing multimodal perception and interaction in robotic vision.

| **[What "Not" to Detect: Negation-Aware VLMs via Structured Reasoning and Token Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13232v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) suffer from a critical failure in understanding negation, often referred to as affirmative bias. This limitation is particularly severe in described object detection (DOD) tasks. To address this, we propose two primary contributions: (1) a new dataset pipeline and (2) a novel, lightweight adaptation recipe. First, we introduce CoVAND, a dataset constructed with a systematic chain-of-thought (CoT) and VQA-based pipeline to generate high-quality, instance-grounded negation data. Second, we propose NegToMe, a novel text token merging module that directly tackles the architectural cause of affirmative bias. NegToMe fundamentally addresses the structural loss of negation cues in tokenization, grouping them with attributes into coherent semantic phrases. It maintains correct polarity at the input level, enabling robust negation understanding even with limited data. For instance, to prevent a model from treating the fragmented tokens "not" and "girl" as simply "girl", NegToMe binds them into a single token whose meaning is correctly distinguished from that of "girl" alone. This module is integrated with a parameter-efficient and strategic LoRA fine-tuning approach. Our method significantly improves performance on challenging negation benchmarks with a lowered false positive rate, boosting NMS-AP by up to +10.8 points on OVDEval and demonstrating generalization to SoTA VLMs. This work marks a crucial step forward in addressing negation understanding for real-world detection applications.</p></details> | 38 pages |
| **[An Analytical Framework to Enhance Autonomous Vehicle Perception for Smart Cities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13230v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The driving environment perception has a vital role for autonomous driving and nowadays has been actively explored for its realization. The research community and relevant stakeholders necessitate the development of Deep Learning (DL) models and AI-enabled solutions to enhance autonomous vehicles (AVs) for smart mobility. There is a need to develop a model that accurately perceives multiple objects on the road and predicts the driver's perception to control the car's movements. This article proposes a novel utility-based analytical model that enables perception systems of AVs to understand the driving environment. The article consists of modules: acquiring a custom dataset having distinctive objects, i.e., motorcyclists, rickshaws, etc; a DL-based model (YOLOv8s) for object detection; and a module to measure the utility of perception service from the performance values of trained model instances. The perception model is validated based on the object detection task, and its process is benchmarked by state-of-the-art deep learning models' performance metrics from the nuScense dataset. The experimental results show three best-performing YOLOv8s instances based on mAP@0.5 values, i.e., SGD-based (0.832), Adam-based (0.810), and AdamW-based (0.822). However, the AdamW-based model (i.e., car: 0.921, motorcyclist: 0.899, truck: 0.793, etc.) still outperforms the SGD-based model (i.e., car: 0.915, motorcyclist: 0.892, truck: 0.781, etc.) because it has better class-level performance values, confirmed by the proposed perception model. We validate that the proposed function is capable of finding the right perception for AVs. The results above encourage using the proposed perception model to evaluate the utility of learning models and determine the appropriate perception for AVs.</p></details> | 32 pages, 14 figures |

Inspired by the recent success of RL in both LLMs and MLLMs, in this paper, we explore how RL can enhance visual perception ability of MLLMs. Then we develop a novel RL-based framework, Deep Inspection and Perception with RL (DIP-R1) designed to enhance the visual perception capabilities of MLLMs, by comprehending complex scenes and looking through visual instances closely. DIP-R1 guides MLLMs through detailed inspection of visual scene via three simply designed rule-based reward modeling. First, we adopt a standard reasoning reward encouraging the model to include three-step reasoning process: 1) comprehending entire visual scene, 2) observing for looking through interested but ambiguous regions, and 3) decision-making for predicting answer. Second, a variance-guided looking reward is designed to encourage MLLM to examine uncertain regions during the observing process, guiding it to inspect ambiguous areas and mitigate perceptual uncertainty. This reward promotes variance-driven visual exploration, enabling MLLM to reason about region-level uncertainty and explicitly indicate interpretable uncertain regions. Third, we model a weighted precision-recall accuracy reward enhancing accurate decision-making. We verify its effectiveness across diverse fine-grained object detection data consisting of challenging real-world scenes, such as densely crowded scenes. Built upon existing MLLMs, DIP-R1 achieves consistent and significant improvement across various in-domain and out-of-domain scenarios, outperforming various existing baselines and SFT method. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of integrating RL into MLLMs for enhancing capabilities in complex real-world perception tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[SHAN: Object-Level Privacy Detection via Inference on Scene Heterogeneous Graph](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09172v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of social platforms, protecting privacy has become an important issue. Privacy object detection aims to accurately locate private objects in images. It is the foundation of safeguarding individuals' privacy rights and ensuring responsible data handling practices in the digital age. Since privacy of object is not shift-invariant, the essence of the privacy object detection task is inferring object privacy based on scene information. However, privacy object detection has long been studied as a subproblem of common object detection tasks. Therefore, existing methods suffer from serious deficiencies in accuracy, generalization, and interpretability. Moreover, creating large-scale privacy datasets is difficult due to legal constraints and existing privacy datasets lack label granularity. The granularity of existing privacy detection methods remains limited to the image level. To address the above two issues, we introduce two benchmark datasets for object-level privacy detection and propose SHAN, Scene Heterogeneous graph Attention Network, a model constructs a scene heterogeneous graph from an image and utilizes self-attention mechanisms for scene inference to obtain object privacy. Through experiments, we demonstrated that SHAN performs excellently in privacy object detection tasks, with all metrics surpassing those of the baseline model.</p></details> | <details><summary>I wou...</summary><p>I would like to formally request the withdrawal of my manuscript from arXiv.

| **[Detect Anything via Next Point Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12798v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection has long been dominated by traditional coordinate regression-based models, such as YOLO, DETR, and Grounding DINO. Although recent efforts have attempted to leverage MLLMs to tackle this task, they face challenges like low recall rate, duplicate predictions, coordinate misalignment, etc. In this work, we bridge this gap and propose Rex-Omni, a 3B-scale MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art object perception performance. On benchmarks like COCO and LVIS, Rex-Omni attains performance comparable to or exceeding regression-based models (e.g., DINO, Grounding DINO) in a zero-shot setting. This is enabled by three key designs: 1) Task Formulation: we use special tokens to represent quantized coordinates from 0 to 999, reducing the model's learning difficulty and improving token efficiency for coordinate prediction; 2) Data Engines: we construct multiple data engines to generate high-quality grounding, referring, and pointing data, providing semantically rich supervision for training; \3) Training Pipelines: we employ a two-stage training process, combining supervised fine-tuning on 22 million data with GRPO-based reinforcement post-training. This RL post-training leverages geometry-aware rewards to effectively bridge the discrete-to-continuous coordinate prediction gap, improve box accuracy, and mitigate undesirable behaviors like duplicate predictions that stem from the teacher-guided nature of the initial SFT stage. Beyond conventional detection, Rex-Omni's inherent language understanding enables versatile capabilities such as object referring, pointing, visual prompting, GUI grounding, spatial referring, OCR and key-pointing, all systematically evaluated on dedicated benchmarks. We believe that Rex-Omni paves the way for more versatile and language-aware visual perception systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>homep...</summary><p>homepage: https://rex-omni.github.io/</p></details> |

To this end, we present PYRONEAR-2025, a new dataset composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models. The data is sourced from: (i) web-scraped videos of wildfires from public networks of cameras for wildfire detection in-the-wild, (ii) videos from our in-house network of cameras, and (iii) a small portion of synthetic and real images. This dataset includes around 150,000 manual annotations on 50,000 images, covering 640 wildfires, PYRONEAR-2025 surpasses existing datasets in size and diversity. It includes data from France, Spain, Chile and the United States. Finally, it is composed of both images and videos, allowing for the training and evaluation of smoke plume detection models, including sequential models. We ran cross-dataset experiments using a lightweight state-of-the-art object detection model, as the ones used in-real-life, and found out the proposed dataset is particularly challenging, with F1 score of around 70\%, but more stable than existing datasets. Finally, its use in concordance with other public datasets helps to reach higher results overall. Last but not least, the video part of the dataset can be used to train a lightweight sequential model, improving global recall while maintaining precision for earlier detections.

Existing methods tend to ignore the physical principles of underwater imaging or simply treat degradation phenomena in underwater images as interference factors that must be eliminated, failing to fully exploit the valuable information they contain. We propose WaterFlow, a rectified flow-based framework for underwater salient object detection that innovatively incorporates underwater physical imaging information as explicit priors directly into the network training process and introduces temporal dimension modeling, significantly enhancing the model's capability for salient object identification. On the USOD10K dataset, WaterFlow achieves a 0.072 gain in S_m, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. The code will be published after the acceptance.</p></details> |  |

However, complementarity between such heterogeneous architectures has not been well exploited in self-supervised learning. Thus, we propose Heterogeneous Self-Supervised Learning (HSSL), which enforces a base model to learn from an auxiliary head whose architecture is heterogeneous from the base model. In this process, HSSL endows the base model with new characteristics in a representation learning way without structural changes. To comprehensively understand the HSSL, we conduct experiments on various heterogeneous pairs containing a base model and an auxiliary head. We discover that the representation quality of the base model moves up as their architecture discrepancy grows. This observation motivates us to propose a search strategy that quickly determines the most suitable auxiliary head for a specific base model to learn and several simple but effective methods to enlarge the model discrepancy. The HSSL is compatible with various self-supervised methods, achieving superior performances on various downstream tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, and object detection.

However, many AI applications are limited by a lack of expertise and resources, which forces a reliance on general-purpose models. Success with these models often requires domain-specific data for fine-tuning, which can be costly and inefficient. Thus, using synthetic data for fine-tuning is a popular, cost-effective alternative to gathering real-world data. This work investigates the impact of synthetic data on the performance of object detection models, compared to models trained on real-world data only, specifically within the domain of warehouse logistics. To this end, we examined the impact of synthetic data generated using the NVIDIA Omniverse Replicator tool on the effectiveness of object detection models in real-world scenarios. It comprises experiments focused on pallet detection in a warehouse setting, utilizing both real and various synthetic dataset generation strategies. Our findings provide valuable insights into the practical applications of synthetic image data in computer vision, suggesting that a balanced integration of synthetic and real data can lead to robust and efficient object detection models.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables.

However, despite these empirical successes, there remains limited understanding of how spiking transformers fundamentally process event-based data. Current approaches primarily focus on architectural modifications without analyzing the underlying signal processing characteristics. In this work, we analyze spiking transformers through the frequency spectrum domain and discover that they behave as high-pass filters, contrasting with Vision Transformers (ViTs) that act as low-pass filters. This frequency domain analysis reveals why certain designs work well for event-based data, which contains valuable high-frequency information but is also sparse and noisy. Based on this observation, we propose SpikePool, which replaces spike-based self-attention with max pooling attention, a low-pass filtering operation, to create a selective band-pass filtering effect. This design preserves meaningful high-frequency content while capturing critical features and suppressing noise, achieving a better balance for event-based data processing. Our approach demonstrates competitive results on event-based datasets for both classification and object detection tasks while significantly reducing training and inference time by up to 42.5% and 32.8%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face two key challenges: underwater image degradation, including low contrast and color distortion, and the natural camouflage of marine organisms. Traditional image enhancement techniques struggle to restore critical features in degraded images, while camouflaged object detection (COD) methods developed for terrestrial scenes often fail to adapt to underwater environments due to the lack of consideration for underwater optical characteristics. To address these issues, we propose APGNet, an Adaptive Prior-Guided Network, which integrates a Siamese architecture with a novel prior-guided mechanism to enhance robustness and detection accuracy. First, we employ the Multi-Scale Retinex with Color Restoration (MSRCR) algorithm for data augmentation, generating illumination-invariant images to mitigate degradation effects. Second, we design an Extended Receptive Field (ERF) module combined with a Multi-Scale Progressive Decoder (MPD) to capture multi-scale contextual information and refine feature representations. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive prior-guided mechanism that hierarchically fuses position and boundary priors by embedding spatial attention in high-level features for coarse localization and using deformable convolution to refine contours in low-level features. Extensive experimental results on two public MAS datasets demonstrate that our proposed method APGNet outperforms 15 state-of-art methods under widely used evaluation metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages. accepted by ACM MM Asia 2025</p></details> |

While camouflaged object detection is a crucial task in computer vision with diverse real-world applications, this research topic has been constrained by limited data availability. We propose a framework for synthesizing camouflage data to enhance the detection of camouflaged objects in natural scenes. Our approach employs a generative model to produce realistic camouflage images, which can be used to train existing object detection models. Specifically, we use a camouflage environment generator supervised by a camouflage distribution classifier to synthesize the camouflage images, which are then fed into our generator to expand the dataset. Our framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art method on three datasets (COD10k, CAMO, and CHAMELEON), demonstrating its effectiveness in improving camouflaged object detection. This approach can serve as a plug-and-play data generation and augmentation module for existing camouflaged object detection tasks and provides a novel way to introduce more diversity and distributions into current camouflage datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, multi-modal methods face significant challenges in feature alignment, and gaining features locally can be oversimplified for complex 3D object detection tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel model, NV3D, which utilizes local features acquired from voxel neighbors, as normal vectors computed per voxel basis using K-nearest neighbors (KNN) and principal component analysis (PCA). This informative feature enables NV3D to determine the relationship between the surface and pertinent target entities, including cars, pedestrians, or cyclists. During the normal vector extraction process, NV3D offers two distinct sampling strategies: normal vector density-based sampling and FOV-aware bin-based sampling, allowing elimination of up to 55% of data while maintaining performance. In addition, we applied element-wise attention fusion, which accepts voxel features as the query and value and normal vector features as the key, similar to the attention mechanism. Our method is trained on the KITTI dataset and has demonstrated superior performance in car and cyclist detection owing to their spatial shapes. In the validation set, NV3D without sampling achieves 86.60% and 80.18% mean Average Precision (mAP), greater than the baseline Voxel R-CNN by 2.61% and 4.23% mAP, respectively. With both samplings, NV3D achieves 85.54% mAP in car detection, exceeding the baseline by 1.56% mAP, despite roughly 55% of voxels being filtered out.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness on Inland Waterways: A YOLO-Based Fusion of Satellite and AIS for Vessel Characterization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11449v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) for inland waterways remains challenged by cooperative system vulnerabilities. This paper presents a novel framework that fuses high-resolution satellite imagery with vessel trajectory data from the Automatic Identification System (AIS). This work addresses the limitations of AIS-based monitoring by leveraging non-cooperative satellite imagery and implementing a fusion approach that links visual detections with AIS data to identify dark vessels, validate cooperative traffic, and support advanced MDA. The You Only Look Once (YOLO) v11 object detection model is used to detect and characterize vessels and barges by vessel type, barge cover, operational status, barge count, and direction of travel. An annotated data set of 4,550 instances was developed from $5{,}973~\mathrm{mi}^2$ of Lower Mississippi River imagery. Evaluation on a held-out test set demonstrated vessel classification (tugboat, crane barge, bulk carrier, cargo ship, and hopper barge) with an F1 score of 95.8\%; barge cover (covered or uncovered) detection yielded an F1 score of 91.6\%; operational status (staged or in motion) classification reached an F1 score of 99.4\%. Directionality (upstream, downstream) yielded 93.8\% accuracy. The barge count estimation resulted in a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.4 barges. Spatial transferability analysis across geographically disjoint river segments showed accuracy was maintained as high as 98\%. These results underscore the viability of integrating non-cooperative satellite sensing with AIS fusion. This approach enables near-real-time fleet inventories, supports anomaly detection, and generates high-quality data for inland waterway surveillance. Future work will expand annotated datasets, incorporate temporal tracking, and explore multi-modal deep learning to further enhance operational scalability.</p></details> |  |

Despite recent progress in video understanding, existing methods predominantly address either coarse-grained action recognition or generic object tracking, thereby overlooking the challenge of jointly detecting and tracking multiple objects according to their actions while grounding them temporally. To address this gap, we introduce Spatio-temporal Video Action Grounding (SVAG), a novel task that requires models to simultaneously detect, track, and temporally localize all referent objects in videos based on natural language descriptions of their actions. To support this task, we construct SVAG-Bench, a large-scale benchmark comprising 688 videos, 19,590 annotated records, and 903 unique verbs, covering a diverse range of objects, actions, and real-world scenes. We further propose SVAGFormer, a baseline framework that adapts state of the art vision language models for joint spatial and temporal grounding, and introduce SVAGEval, a standardized evaluation toolkit for fair and reproducible benchmarking. Empirical results show that existing models perform poorly on SVAG, particularly in dense or complex scenes, underscoring the need for more advanced reasoning over fine-grained object-action interactions in long videos.</p></details> |  |

However, the scarcity of high-quality panoramic training data-caused by inherent kinematic constraints and complex sensor calibration challenges-fundamentally limits the development of robust perception systems tailored to these embodied platforms. To address this issue, we propose QuaDreamer-the first panoramic data generation engine specifically designed for quadruped robots. QuaDreamer focuses on mimicking the motion paradigm of quadruped robots to generate highly controllable, realistic panoramic videos, providing a data source for downstream tasks. Specifically, to effectively capture the unique vertical vibration characteristics exhibited during quadruped locomotion, we introduce Vertical Jitter Encoding (VJE). VJE extracts controllable vertical signals through frequency-domain feature filtering and provides high-quality prompts. To facilitate high-quality panoramic video generation under jitter signal control, we propose a Scene-Object Controller (SOC) that effectively manages object motion and boosts background jitter control through the attention mechanism. To address panoramic distortions in wide-FoV video generation, we propose the Panoramic Enhancer (PE)-a dual-stream architecture that synergizes frequency-texture refinement for local detail enhancement with spatial-structure correction for global geometric consistency. We further demonstrate that the generated video sequences can serve as training data for the quadruped robot's panoramic visual perception model, enhancing the performance of multi-object tracking in 360-degree scenes.

However, existing methods rely on static textual descriptions from large language models, which lack adaptability to real-time target state changes and prone to hallucinations. To address these challenges, we propose a unified multimodal vision-language tracking framework, named EPIPTrack, which leverages explicit and implicit prompts for dynamic target modeling and semantic alignment. Specifically, explicit prompts transform spatial motion information into natural language descriptions to provide spatiotemporal guidance. Implicit prompts combine pseudo-words with learnable descriptors to construct individualized knowledge representations capturing appearance attributes. Both prompts undergo dynamic adjustment via the CLIP text encoder to respond to changes in target state. Furthermore, we design a Discriminative Feature Augmentor to enhance visual and cross-modal representations. Extensive experiments on MOT17, MOT20, and DanceTrack demonstrate that EPIPTrack outperforms existing trackers in diverse scenarios, exhibiting robust adaptability and superior performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[MMOT: The First Challenging Benchmark for Drone-based Multispectral Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12565v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Drone-based multi-object tracking is essential yet highly challenging due to small targets, severe occlusions, and cluttered backgrounds. Existing RGB-based tracking algorithms heavily depend on spatial appearance cues such as color and texture, which often degrade in aerial views, compromising reliability. Multispectral imagery, capturing pixel-level spectral reflectance, provides crucial cues that enhance object discriminability under degraded spatial conditions. However, the lack of dedicated multispectral UAV datasets has hindered progress in this domain. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMOT, the first challenging benchmark for drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking. It features three key characteristics: (i) Large Scale - 125 video sequences with over 488.8K annotations across eight categories; (ii) Comprehensive Challenges - covering diverse conditions such as extreme small targets, high-density scenarios, severe occlusions, and complex motion; and (iii) Precise Oriented Annotations - enabling accurate localization and reduced ambiguity under aerial perspectives. To better extract spectral features and leverage oriented annotations, we further present a multispectral and orientation-aware MOT scheme adapting existing methods, featuring: (i) a lightweight Spectral 3D-Stem integrating spectral features while preserving compatibility with RGB pretraining; (ii) an orientation-aware Kalman filter for precise state estimation; and (iii) an end-to-end orientation-adaptive transformer. Extensive experiments across representative trackers consistently show that multispectral input markedly improves tracking performance over RGB baselines, particularly for small and densely packed objects. We believe our work will advance drone-based multispectral multi-object tracking research. Our MMOT, code, and benchmarks are publicly available at https://github.com/Annzstbl/MMOT.</p></details> |  |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16 million QA pairs over 285K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, achieving near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |
| **[LTGS: Long-Term Gaussian Scene Chronology From Sparse View Updates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09881v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in novel-view synthesis can create the photo-realistic visualization of real-world environments from conventional camera captures. However, acquiring everyday environments from casual captures faces challenges due to frequent scene changes, which require dense observations both spatially and temporally. We propose long-term Gaussian scene chronology from sparse-view updates, coined LTGS, an efficient scene representation that can embrace everyday changes from highly under-constrained casual captures. Given an incomplete and unstructured Gaussian splatting representation obtained from an initial set of input images, we robustly model the long-term chronology of the scene despite abrupt movements and subtle environmental variations. We construct objects as template Gaussians, which serve as structural, reusable priors for shared object tracks. Then, the object templates undergo a further refinement pipeline that modulates the priors to adapt to temporally varying environments based on few-shot observations. Once trained, our framework is generalizable across multiple time steps through simple transformations, significantly enhancing the scalability for a temporal evolution of 3D environments. As existing datasets do not explicitly represent the long-term real-world changes with a sparse capture setup, we collect real-world datasets to evaluate the practicality of our pipeline. Experiments demonstrate that our framework achieves superior reconstruction quality compared to other baselines while enabling fast and light-weight updates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Self-Supervised depth and mask aware Association for Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09878v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking (MOT) methods often rely on Intersection-over-Union (IoU) for association. However, this becomes unreliable when objects are similar or occluded. Also, computing IoU for segmentation masks is computationally expensive. In this work, we use segmentation masks to capture object shapes, but we do not compute segmentation IoU. Instead, we fuse depth and mask features and pass them through a compact encoder trained self-supervised. This encoder produces stable object representations, which we use as an additional similarity cue alongside bounding box IoU and re-identification features for matching. We obtain depth maps from a zero-shot depth estimator and object masks from a promptable visual segmentation model to obtain fine-grained spatial cues. Our MOT method is the first to use the self-supervised encoder to refine segmentation masks without computing masks IoU. MOT can be divided into joint detection-ReID (JDR) and tracking-by-detection (TBD) models. The latter are computationally more efficient. Experiments of our TBD method on challenging benchmarks with non-linear motion, occlusion, and crowded scenes, such as SportsMOT and DanceTrack, show that our method outperforms the TBD state-of-the-art on most metrics, while achieving competitive performance on simpler benchmarks with linear motion, such as MOT17.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contour Errors: An Ego-Centric Metric for Reliable 3D Multi-Object Tracking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04122v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding reliable matches is essential in multi-object tracking to ensure the accuracy and reliability of perception systems in safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. Effective matching mitigates perception errors, enhancing object identification and tracking for improved performance and safety. However, traditional metrics such as Intersection over Union (IoU) and Center Point Distances (CPDs), which are effective in 2D image planes, often fail to find critical matches in complex 3D scenes. To address this limitation, we introduce Contour Errors (CEs), an ego or object-centric metric for identifying matches of interest in tracking scenarios from a functional perspective. By comparing bounding boxes in the ego vehicle's frame, contour errors provide a more functionally relevant assessment of object matches. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that contour errors improve the reliability of matches over the state-of-the-art 2D IoU and CPD metrics in tracking-by-detection methods. In 3D car tracking, our results show that Contour Errors reduce functional failures (FPs/FNs) by 80% at close ranges and 60% at far ranges compared to IoU in the evaluation stage.</p></details> |  |

However, complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.</p></details> |  |

It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity. Key properties of the functional derivative are revealed and discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

However, existing algorithms often involve complex designs and multiple loss functions, making model training and deployment challenging. Furthermore, their reliance on fixed probability distribution assumptions (e.g., Laplacian or Gaussian) hinders their ability to adapt to diverse target characteristics such as varying sizes and motion patterns, ultimately affecting tracking precision and robustness. To address these issues, we propose BEVTrack, a simple yet effective motion-based tracking method. BEVTrack directly estimates object motion in Bird's-Eye View (BEV) using a single regression loss. To enhance accuracy for targets with diverse attributes, it learns adaptive likelihood functions tailored to individual targets, avoiding the limitations of fixed distribution assumptions in previous methods. This approach provides valuable priors for tracking and significantly boosts performance. Comprehensive experiments on KITTI, NuScenes, and Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that BEVTrack achieves state-of-the-art results while operating at 200 FPS, enabling real-time applicability. The code will be released at https://github.com/xmm-prio/BEVTrack.</p></details> | IJCAI version |

However, current fusion methods achieve high performance at the cost of significant computational overhead and struggle to efficiently extract the sparse, asynchronous information from event streams, failing to leverage the energy-efficient advantages of event-driven spiking paradigms. To address this challenge, we propose the first fully Spiking Frame-Event Tracking framework called SpikeFET. This network achieves synergistic integration of convolutional local feature extraction and Transformer-based global modeling within the spiking paradigm, effectively fusing frame and event data. To overcome the degradation of translation invariance caused by convolutional padding, we introduce a Random Patchwork Module (RPM) that eliminates positional bias through randomized spatial reorganization and learnable type encoding while preserving residual structures. Furthermore, we propose a Spatial-Temporal Regularization (STR) strategy that overcomes similarity metric degradation from asymmetric features by enforcing spatio-temporal consistency among temporal template features in latent space. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior tracking accuracy over existing methods while significantly reducing power consumption, attaining an optimal balance between performance and efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

While recent advances in general motion tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these policies lack the precision and object awareness required for loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion, serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements. An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness over strong baselines.

Multispectral imagery, which captures pixel-level spectral reflectance, enhances target discriminability. However, the availability of multispectral tracking datasets remains limited. To bridge this gap, we introduce MSITrack, the largest and most diverse multispectral single object tracking dataset to date. MSITrack offers the following key features: (i) More Challenging Attributes-including interference from similar objects and similarity in color and texture between targets and backgrounds in natural scenarios, along with a wide range of real-world tracking challenges; (ii) Richer and More Natural Scenes-spanning 55 object categories and 300 distinct natural scenes, MSITrack far exceeds the scope of existing benchmarks. Many of these scenes and categories are introduced to the multispectral tracking domain for the first time; (iii) Larger Scale-300 videos comprising over 129k frames of multispectral imagery. To ensure annotation precision, each frame has undergone meticulous processing, manual labeling and multi-stage verification. Extensive evaluations using representative trackers demonstrate that the multispectral data in MSITrack significantly improves performance over RGB-only baselines, highlighting its potential to drive future advancements in the field.

While recent generative video-to-audio models achieve strong semantic and temporal fidelity, they largely remain limited to mono or fail to deliver object-aware stereo imaging, constrained by the lack of professionally mixed, spatially accurate video-to-audio datasets. First, we develop and train a base model that generates stereo audio from video, achieving state-of-the-art in both semantic accuracy and synchronization. Next, to overcome dataset limitations, we introduce a synthetic data generation pipeline that combines video analysis, object tracking, and audio synthesis with dynamic panning and distance-based loudness controls, enabling spatially accurate object-aware sound. Finally, we fine-tune the base model on this synthetic dataset, yielding clear object-audio correspondence. Since no established metrics exist, we introduce stereo object-awareness measures and validate it through a human listening study, showing strong correlation with perception. This work establishes the first end-to-end framework for stereo object-aware video-to-audio generation, addressing a critical gap and setting a new benchmark in the field.</p></details> |  |

However, they still underutilize two essentials: modality-specific frequency structure and long-range temporal dependencies. We present Learning Frequency and Memory-Aware Prompts, a dual-adapter framework that injects lightweight prompts into a frozen RGB tracker. A frequency-guided visual adapter adaptively transfers complementary cues across modalities by jointly calibrating spatial, channel, and frequency components, narrowing the modality gap without full fine-tuning. A multilevel memory adapter with short, long, and permanent memory stores, updates, and retrieves reliable temporal context, enabling consistent propagation across frames and robust recovery from occlusion, motion blur, and illumination changes. This unified design preserves the efficiency of prompt learning while strengthening cross-modal interaction and temporal coherence. Extensive experiments on RGB-Thermal, RGB-Depth, and RGB-Event benchmarks show consistent state-of-the-art results over fully fine-tuned and adapter-based baselines, together with favorable parameter efficiency and runtime.

However, its strict reliance on precise temporal synchronization exposes it to new vulnerabilities. In this paper, we introduce DejaVu, an attack that exploits the in-vehicular network and induces delays across sensor streams to create subtle temporal misalignments, severely degrading downstream MMF-based perception tasks. Our comprehensive attack analysis across different models and datasets reveals the sensors' task-specific imbalanced sensitivities: object detection is overly dependent on LiDAR inputs, while object tracking is highly reliant on the camera inputs. Consequently, with a single-frame LiDAR delay, an attacker can reduce the car detection mAP by up to 88.5%, while with a three-frame camera delay, multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA) for car drops by 73%. We further demonstrated two attack scenarios using an automotive Ethernet testbed for hardware-in-the-loop validation and the Autoware stack for end-to-end AD simulation, demonstrating the feasibility of the DejaVu attack and its severe impact, such as collisions and phantom braking.</p></details> | 15 pages |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a new class of prompt-based attacks that exploit the multimodal language interpretation abilities of Large Visual-Language Models (LVLMs). CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents; drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, and aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> |  |

While approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and rule-based reward mechanisms demonstrate promise in text and image domains, their application to video understanding remains limited. This paper presents a systematic exploration of Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) with GRPO for video MLLMs, aiming to enhance spatio-temporal perception while maintaining general capabilities. Our experiments reveal that RFT is highly data-efficient for task-specific improvements. Through multi-task RFT on spatio-temporal perception objectives with limited samples, we develop VideoChat-R1, a powerful video MLLM that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatio-temporal perception tasks without sacrificing chat ability, while exhibiting emerging spatio-temporal reasoning abilities. Compared to Qwen2.5-VL-7B, VideoChat-R1 boosts performance several-fold in tasks like temporal grounding (+31.8) and object tracking (+31.2). Additionally, it significantly improves on general QA benchmarks such as VideoMME (+0.9), MVBench (+1.0), and Perception Test (+0.9). Our findings underscore the potential of RFT for specialized task enhancement of Video MLLMs. We hope our work offers valuable insights for future RL research in video MLLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborating Vision, Depth, and Thermal Signals for Multi-Modal Tracking: Dataset and Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24741v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing multi-modal object tracking approaches primarily focus on dual-modal paradigms, such as RGB-Depth or RGB-Thermal, yet remain challenged in complex scenarios due to limited input modalities. To address this gap, this work introduces a novel multi-modal tracking task that leverages three complementary modalities, including visible RGB, Depth (D), and Thermal Infrared (TIR), aiming to enhance robustness in complex scenarios. To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack. RDTTrack integrates tri-modal information for robust tracking by leveraging a pretrained RGB-only tracking model and prompt learning techniques. In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Recent DETR-based frameworks offer end-to-end solutions but typically process detection and tracking queries jointly within a single Transformer Decoder layer, leading to conflicts and degraded association accuracy. We introduce the Motion-Aware Transformer (MATR), which explicitly predicts object movements across frames to update track queries in advance. By reducing query collisions, MATR enables more consistent training and improves both detection and association. Extensive experiments on DanceTrack, SportsMOT, and BDD100k show that MATR delivers significant gains across standard metrics. On DanceTrack, MATR improves HOTA by more than 9 points over MOTR without additional data and reaches a new state-of-the-art score of 71.3 with supplementary data. MATR also achieves state-of-the-art results on SportsMOT (72.2 HOTA) and BDD100k (54.7 mTETA, 41.6 mHOTA) without relying on external datasets. These results demonstrate that explicitly modeling motion within end-to-end Transformers offers a simple yet highly effective approach to advancing multi-object tracking.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a generalized tracking framework capable of handling multiple object types, with a particular emphasis on vehicle tracking in complex traffic scenes. The proposed method incorporates two key components: (1) an occlusion-aware re-identification mechanism that enhances identity preservation for heavily occluded objects, and (2) a road-structure-aware tracklet refinement strategy that utilizes semantic scene priors such as lane directions, crosswalks, and road boundaries to improve trajectory continuity and accuracy. In addition, we introduce a new benchmark dataset comprising diverse vehicle classes with frame-level tracking annotations, specifically curated to support evaluation of vehicle-focused tracking methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves robust performance on both the newly introduced dataset and several public benchmarks, highlighting its effectiveness in general-purpose object tracking. While our framework is designed for generalized multi-class tracking, it also achieves strong performance on conventional benchmarks, with HOTA scores of 66.4 on MOT17 and 65.7 on MOT20 test sets.

Traditional tracking systems often rely on hand-crafted features and motion models, which can struggle to maintain consistent object identities in crowded or fast-moving scenes. We present a lidar-based two-staged DETR inspired transformer; a smoother and tracker. The smoother stage refines lidar object detections, from any off-the-shelf detector, across a moving temporal window. The tracker stage uses a DETR-based attention block to maintain tracks across time by associating tracked objects with the refined detections using the point cloud as context. The model is trained on the datasets nuScenes and KITTI in both online and offline (forward peeking) modes demonstrating strong performance across metrics such as ID-switch and multiple object tracking accuracy (MOTA). The numerical results indicate that the online mode outperforms the lidar-only baseline and SOTA models on the nuScenes dataset, with an aMOTA of 0.724 and an aMOTP of 0.475, while the offline mode provides an additional 3 pp aMOTP.</p></details> | Camera-ready copy |

Infrastructure-based vision sensors offer scalable and efficient solutions for continuous real-time monitoring, facilitating automated detection of accidents directly from captured images. This research investigates the zero-shot capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for detecting and describing traffic accidents using images from infrastructure cameras, thus minimizing reliance on extensive labeled datasets. Main contributions include: (1) Evaluation of MLLMs using the simulated DeepAccident dataset from CARLA, explicitly addressing the scarcity of diverse, realistic, infrastructure-based accident data through controlled simulations; (2) Comparative performance analysis between Gemini 1.5 and 2.0, Gemma 3 and Pixtral models in accident identification and descriptive capabilities without prior fine-tuning; and (3) Integration of advanced visual analytics, specifically YOLO for object detection, Deep SORT for multi-object tracking, and Segment Anything (SAM) for instance segmentation, into enhanced prompts to improve model accuracy and explainability. Key numerical results show Pixtral as the top performer with an F1-score of 0.71 and 83% recall, while Gemini models gained precision with enhanced prompts (e.g., Gemini 1.5 rose to 90%) but suffered notable F1 and recall losses. Gemma 3 offered the most balanced performance with minimal metric fluctuation. These findings demonstrate the substantial potential of integrating MLLMs with advanced visual analytics techniques, enhancing their applicability in real-world automated traffic monitoring systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Automated Vehicle Validation Conference (IAVVC 2025).

| **[An Analysis of Kalman Filter based Object Tracking Methods for Fast-Moving Tiny Objects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18451v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unpredictable movement patterns and small visual mark make precise tracking of fast-moving tiny objects like a racquetball one of the challenging problems in computer vision. This challenge is particularly relevant for sport robotics applications, where lightweight and accurate tracking systems can improve robot perception and planning capabilities. While Kalman filter-based tracking methods have shown success in general object tracking scenarios, their performance degrades substantially when dealing with rapidly moving objects that exhibit irregular bouncing behavior. In this study, we evaluate the performance of five state-of-the-art Kalman filter-based tracking methods-OCSORT, DeepOCSORT, ByteTrack, BoTSORT, and StrongSORT-using a custom dataset containing 10,000 annotated racquetball frames captured at 720p-1280p resolution. We focus our analysis on two critical performance factors: inference speed and update frequency per image, examining how these parameters affect tracking accuracy and reliability for fast-moving tiny objects. Our experimental evaluation across four distinct scenarios reveals that DeepOCSORT achieves the lowest tracking error with an average ADE of 31.15 pixels compared to ByteTrack's 114.3 pixels, while ByteTrack demonstrates the fastest processing at 26.6ms average inference time versus DeepOCSORT's 26.8ms. However, our results show that all Kalman filter-based trackers exhibit significant tracking drift with spatial errors ranging from 3-11cm (ADE values: 31-114 pixels), indicating fundamental limitations in handling the unpredictable motion patterns of fast-moving tiny objects like racquetballs. Our analysis demonstrates that current tracking approaches require substantial improvements, with error rates 3-4x higher than standard object tracking benchmarks, highlighting the need for specialized methodologies for fast-moving tiny object tracking applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[MOSEv2: A More Challenging Dataset for Video Object Segmentation in Complex Scenes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05630v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video object segmentation (VOS) aims to segment specified target objects throughout a video. Although state-of-the-art methods have achieved impressive performance (e.g., 90+% J&F) on benchmarks such as DAVIS and YouTube-VOS, these datasets primarily contain salient, dominant, and isolated objects, limiting their generalization to real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, the coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSEv1) dataset was introduced to facilitate VOS research in complex scenes. Building on the foundations and insights of MOSEv1, we present MOSEv2, a significantly more challenging dataset designed to further advance VOS methods under real-world conditions. MOSEv2 consists of 5,024 videos and 701,976 high-quality masks for 10,074 objects across 200 categories. Compared to its predecessor, MOSEv2 introduces much greater scene complexity, including {more frequent object disappearance and reappearance, severe occlusions and crowding, smaller objects, as well as a range of new challenges such as adverse weather (e.g., rain, snow, fog), low-light scenes (e.g., nighttime, underwater), multi-shot sequences, camouflaged objects, non-physical targets (e.g., shadows, reflections), and scenarios requiring external knowledge.} We benchmark 20 representative VOS methods under 5 different settings and observe consistent performance drops on MOSEv2. For example, SAM2 drops from 76.4% on MOSEv1 to only 50.9% on MOSEv2. We further evaluate 9 video object tracking methods and observe similar declines, demonstrating that MOSEv2 poses challenges across tasks. These results highlight that despite strong performance on existing datasets, current VOS methods still fall short under real-world complexities. Based on our analysis of the observed challenges, we further propose several practical tricks that enhance model performance.

Trackers relying on these 2D cues are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations, leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference, without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost. By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges. Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47, respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking.

To address these challenges, we present \textbf{StableTracker}, a learning-based control policy that enables quadrotors to robustly follow the moving target from arbitrary perspectives. The policy is trained using backpropagation-through-time via differentiable simulation, allowing the quadrotor to maintain the target at the center of the visual field in both horizontal and vertical directions, while keeping a fixed relative distance, thereby functioning as an autonomous aerial camera. We compare StableTracker against both state-of-the-art traditional algorithms and learning baselines. Simulation experiments demonstrate that our policy achieves superior accuracy, stability and generalization across varying safe distances, trajectories, and target velocities. Furthermore, a real-world experiment on a quadrotor with an onboard computer validated practicality of the proposed approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding author requires to do so</p></details> |

LBM decomposes visual representations into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025.

In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise intensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the estimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that integrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and a Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the predicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary sensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation results show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the conventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector fusion are also presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Yet, the scarcity of large-scale paired datasets containing multiple images of the same individual forces most approaches to adopt reconstruction-based training. This reliance often leads to a failure mode we term copy-paste, where the model directly replicates the reference face rather than preserving identity across natural variations in pose, expression, or lighting. Such over-similarity undermines controllability and limits the expressive power of generation. To address these limitations, we (1) construct a large-scale paired dataset MultiID-2M, tailored for multi-person scenarios, providing diverse references for each identity; (2) introduce a benchmark that quantifies both copy-paste artifacts and the trade-off between identity fidelity and variation; and (3) propose a novel training paradigm with a contrastive identity loss that leverages paired data to balance fidelity with diversity. These contributions culminate in WithAnyone, a diffusion-based model that effectively mitigates copy-paste while preserving high identity similarity. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that WithAnyone significantly reduces copy-paste artifacts, improves controllability over pose and expression, and maintains strong perceptual quality. User studies further validate that our method achieves high identity fidelity while enabling expressive controllable generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 Pa...</summary><p>23 Pages; Project Page: https://doby-xu.github.io/WithAnyone/; Code: https://github.com/Doby-Xu/WithAnyone</p></details> |
| **[ScaleWeaver: Weaving Efficient Controllable T2I Generation with Multi-Scale Reference Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14882v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image generation with visual autoregressive~(VAR) models has recently achieved impressive advances in generation fidelity and inference efficiency. While control mechanisms have been explored for diffusion models, enabling precise and flexible control within VAR paradigm remains underexplored. To bridge this critical gap, in this paper, we introduce ScaleWeaver, a novel framework designed to achieve high-fidelity, controllable generation upon advanced VAR models through parameter-efficient fine-tuning. The core module in ScaleWeaver is the improved MMDiT block with the proposed Reference Attention module, which efficiently and effectively incorporates conditional information. Different from MM Attention, the proposed Reference Attention module discards the unnecessary attention from image$\rightarrow$condition, reducing computational cost while stabilizing control injection. Besides, it strategically emphasizes parameter reuse, leveraging the capability of the VAR backbone itself with a few introduced parameters to process control information, and equipping a zero-initialized linear projection to ensure that control signals are incorporated effectively without disrupting the generative capability of the base model. Extensive experiments show that ScaleWeaver delivers high-quality generation and precise control while attaining superior efficiency over diffusion-based methods, making ScaleWeaver a practical and effective solution for controllable text-to-image generation within the visual autoregressive paradigm. Code and models will be released.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has primarily examined demographic and cultural biases, the ability of these models to accurately represent historical contexts remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a benchmark for evaluating how TTI models depict historical contexts. The benchmark combines HistVis, a dataset of 30,000 synthetic images generated by three state-of-the-art diffusion models from carefully designed prompts covering universal human activities across multiple historical periods, with a reproducible evaluation protocol. We evaluate generated imagery across three key aspects: (1) Implicit Stylistic Associations: examining default visual styles associated with specific eras; (2) Historical Consistency: identifying anachronisms such as modern artifacts in pre-modern contexts; and (3) Demographic Representation: comparing generated racial and gender distributions against historically plausible baselines. Our findings reveal systematic inaccuracies in historically themed generated imagery, as TTI models frequently stereotype past eras by incorporating unstated stylistic cues, introduce anachronisms, and fail to reflect plausible demographic patterns. By providing a reproducible benchmark for historical representation in generated imagery, this work provides an initial step toward building more historically accurate TTI models.</p></details> |  |

This study examined whether six text-to-image models (Janus-Pro-7B VL2 vs. VL3, DALL-E 3 v. April 2024 vs. August 2025, Stable Diffusion v. 1.6 vs. 3.5, SDXL v. April 2024 vs. FLUX.1 Pro, and Midjourney v. 5.1 vs. 7) perpetuate non-rational beliefs regarding autism by comparing images generated in 2024-2025 with controls. 53 prompts aimed at neutrally visualizing concrete objects and abstract concepts related to autism were used against 53 controls (baseline total N=302, follow-up experimental 280 images plus 265 controls). Expert assessment measuring the presence of common autism-related stereotypes employed a framework of 10 deductive codes followed by statistical analysis. Autistic individuals were depicted with striking homogeneity in skin color (white), gender (male), and age (young), often engaged in solitary activities, interacting with objects rather than people, and exhibiting stereotypical emotional expressions such as sadness, anger, or emotional flatness. In contrast, the images of neurotypical individuals were more diverse and lacked such traits. We found significant differences between the models; however, with a moderate effect size, and no differences between baseline and follow-up summary values, with the ratio of stereotypical themes to the number of images similar across all models. The control prompts showed a significantly lower degree of stereotyping with large size effects, confirming the hidden biases of the models. In summary, despite improvements in the technical aspects of image generation, the level of reproduction of potentially harmful autism-related stereotypes remained largely unaffected.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of a publication accepted to Identity-Aware AI 2025 (ECAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Consistent text-to-image generation via scene de-contextualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14553v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes. This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Image Representation with Decoupled Classical Visual Descriptors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14536v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploring and understanding efficient image representations is a long-standing challenge in computer vision. While deep learning has achieved remarkable progress across image understanding tasks, its internal representations are often opaque, making it difficult to interpret how visual information is processed. In contrast, classical visual descriptors (e.g. edge, colour, and intensity distribution) have long been fundamental to image analysis and remain intuitively understandable to humans. Motivated by this gap, we ask a central question: Can modern learning benefit from these classical cues? In this paper, we answer it with VisualSplit, a framework that explicitly decomposes images into decoupled classical descriptors, treating each as an independent but complementary component of visual knowledge. Through a reconstruction-driven pre-training scheme, VisualSplit learns to capture the essence of each visual descriptor while preserving their interpretability. By explicitly decomposing visual attributes, our method inherently facilitates effective attribute control in various advanced visual tasks, including image generation and editing, extending beyond conventional classification and segmentation, suggesting the effectiveness of this new learning approach for visual understanding.

| **[Noise Projection: Closing the Prompt-Agnostic Gap Behind Text-to-Image Misalignment in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14526v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In text-to-image generation, different initial noises induce distinct denoising paths with a pretrained Stable Diffusion (SD) model. While this pattern could output diverse images, some of them may fail to align well with the prompt. Existing methods alleviate this issue either by altering the denoising dynamics or by drawing multiple noises and conducting post-selection. In this paper, we attribute the misalignment to a training-inference mismatch: during training, prompt-conditioned noises lie in a prompt-specific subset of the latent space, whereas at inference the noise is drawn from a prompt-agnostic Gaussian prior. To close this gap, we propose a noise projector that applies text-conditioned refinement to the initial noise before denoising. Conditioned on the prompt embedding, it maps the noise to a prompt-aware counterpart that better matches the distribution observed during SD training, without modifying the SD model. Our framework consists of these steps: we first sample some noises and obtain token-level feedback for their corresponding images from a vision-language model (VLM), then distill these signals into a reward model, and finally optimize the noise projector via a quasi-direct preference optimization. Our design has two benefits: (i) it requires no reference images or handcrafted priors, and (ii) it incurs small inference cost, replacing multi-sample selection with a single forward pass. Extensive experiments further show that our prompt-aware noise projection improves text-image alignment across diverse prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appen...</summary><p>Appendix will be appended soon</p></details> |

However, these models still struggle with prompts involving multiple objects, often resulting in object neglect or object mixing. Through extensive studies, we identify four problematic scenarios, Similar Shapes, Similar Textures, Dissimilar Background Biases, and Many Objects, where inter-object relationships frequently lead to such failures. Motivated by two key observations about CLIP embeddings, we propose DOS (Directional Object Separation), a method that modifies three types of CLIP text embeddings before passing them into text-to-image models. Experimental results show that DOS consistently improves the success rate of multi-object image generation and reduces object mixing. In human evaluations, DOS significantly outperforms four competing methods, receiving 26.24%-43.04% more votes across four benchmarks. These results highlight DOS as a practical and effective solution for improving multi-object image generation.</p></details> |  |

While prior methods emphasize identity preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation.

Despite recent advancements in Text-to-Image (T2I) generation and their performance in generating high-quality images for explicit descriptions, evaluating these models remains challenging. Existing evaluation methods focus largely on assessing alignment with explicit, detailed descriptions, but evaluating alignment with visually implicit prompts remains an open problem. Additionally, creativity and persuasiveness are essential qualities that enhance the effectiveness of advertisement images, yet are seldom measured. To address this, we propose three novel metrics for evaluating the creativity, alignment, and persuasiveness of generated images. Our findings reveal that current T2I models struggle with creativity, persuasiveness, and alignment when the input text is implicit messages. We further introduce a simple yet effective approach to enhance T2I models' capabilities in producing images that are better aligned, more creative, and more persuasive.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies often use image-based reconstruction errors as an important feature for determining whether an image is AI-generated. However, these approaches typically incur high computational costs and also fail to capture intrinsic noisy features present in the raw images. To solve these problems, we innovatively refine error extraction by using bit-plane-based image processing, as lower bit planes indeed represent noise patterns in images. We introduce an effective bit-planes guided noisy image generation and exploit various image normalization strategies, including scaling and thresholding. Then, to amplify the noise signal for easier AI-generated image detection, we design a maximum gradient patch selection that applies multi-directional gradients to compute the noise score and selects the region with the highest score. Finally, we propose a lightweight and effective classification head and explore two different structures: noise-based classifier and noise-guided classifier. Extensive experiments on the GenImage benchmark demonstrate the outstanding performance of our method, which achieves an average accuracy of \textbf{98.9\%} (\textbf{11.9}\%~$\uparrow$) and shows excellent cross-generator generalization capability. Particularly, our method achieves an accuracy of over 98.2\% from GAN to Diffusion and over 99.2\% from Diffusion to GAN. Moreover, it performs error extraction at the millisecond level, nearly a hundred times faster than existing methods.

| **[CausalVerse: Benchmarking Causal Representation Learning with Configurable High-Fidelity Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14049v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal Representation Learning (CRL) aims to uncover the data-generating process and identify the underlying causal variables and relations, whose evaluation remains inherently challenging due to the requirement of known ground-truth causal variables and causal structure. Existing evaluations often rely on either simplistic synthetic datasets or downstream performance on real-world tasks, generally suffering a dilemma between realism and evaluative precision. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark for CRL using high-fidelity simulated visual data that retains both realistic visual complexity and, more importantly, access to ground-truth causal generating processes. The dataset comprises around 200 thousand images and 3 million video frames across 24 sub-scenes in four domains: static image generation, dynamic physical simulations, robotic manipulations, and traffic situation analysis. These scenarios range from static to dynamic settings, simple to complex structures, and single to multi-agent interactions, offering a comprehensive testbed that hopefully bridges the gap between rigorous evaluation and real-world applicability. In addition, we provide flexible access to the underlying causal structures, allowing users to modify or configure them to align with the required assumptions in CRL, such as available domain labels, temporal dependencies, or intervention histories. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluated representative CRL methods across diverse paradigms and offered empirical insights to assist practitioners and newcomers in choosing or extending appropriate CRL frameworks to properly address specific types of real problems that can benefit from the CRL perspective.

| **[Generative Universal Verifier as Multimodal Meta-Reasoner](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13804v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Generative Universal Verifier, a novel concept and plugin designed for next-generation multimodal reasoning in vision-language models and unified multimodal models, providing the fundamental capability of reflection and refinement on visual outcomes during the reasoning and generation process. This work makes three main contributions: (1) We build ViVerBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning 16 categories of critical tasks for evaluating visual outcomes in multimodal reasoning. Results show that existing VLMs consistently underperform across these tasks, underscoring a substantial gap from human-level capability in reliable visual verification. (2) We design two automated pipelines to construct large-scale visual verification data and train OmniVerifier-7B, the first omni-capable generative verifier trained for universal visual verification and achieves notable gains on ViVerBench(+8.3). Through training, we identify three atomic capabilities in visual verification and demonstrate how they generalize and interact synergistically. (3) We propose OmniVerifier-TTS, a sequential test-time scaling paradigm that leverages the universal verifier to bridge image generation and editing within unified models, enhancing the upper bound of generative ability through iterative fine-grained optimization. Beyond generation, we extend universal verifier to broader world-modeling interleaved reasoning scenarios. Empirically, OmniVerifier-TTS achieves improvements on T2I-ReasonBench(+3.7), and GenEval++(+4.3), outperforming existing parallel test-time scaling methods, such as Best-of-N. By endowing multimodal reasoning with reliable visual verification, OmniVerifier advances both reliable reflection during generation and scalable test-time refinement, marking a step toward more trustworthy and controllable next-generation reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

However, when applied to e-commerce scenarios, these general models often encounter consistency limitations. To address this challenge, we introduce TBStar-Edit, an new image editing model tailored for the e-commerce domain. Through rigorous data engineering, model architecture design and training strategy, TBStar-Edit achieves precise and high-fidelity image editing while maintaining the integrity of product appearance and layout. Specifically, for data engineering, we establish a comprehensive data construction pipeline, encompassing data collection, construction, filtering, and augmentation, to acquire high-quality, instruction-following, and strongly consistent editing data to support model training. For model architecture design, we design a hierarchical model framework consisting of a base model, pattern shifting modules, and consistency enhancement modules. For model training, we adopt a two-stage training strategy to enhance the consistency preservation: first stage for editing pattern shifting, and second stage for consistency enhancement. Each stage involves training different modules with separate datasets. Finally, we conduct extensive evaluations of TBStar-Edit on a self-proposed e-commerce benchmark, and the results demonstrate that TBStar-Edit outperforms existing general-domain editing models in both objective metrics (VIE Score) and subjective user preference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning Meets Masked Generative Models: Mask-GRPO for Text-to-Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13418v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has garnered increasing attention in text-to-image (T2I) generation. However, most existing RL approaches are tailored to either diffusion models or autoregressive models, overlooking an important alternative: masked generative models. In this work, we propose Mask-GRPO, the first method to incorporate Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)-based RL into this overlooked paradigm. Our core insight is to redefine the transition probability, which is different from current approaches, and formulate the unmasking process as a multi-step decision-making problem. To further enhance our method, we explore several useful strategies, including removing the KL constraint, applying the reduction strategy, and filtering out low-quality samples. Using Mask-GRPO, we improve a base model, Show-o, with substantial improvements on standard T2I benchmarks and preference alignment, outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches. The code is available on https://github.com/xingzhejun/Mask-GRPO</p></details> |  |
| **[SafeGuider: Robust and Practical Content Safety Control for Text-to-Image Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05173v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image models have shown remarkable capabilities in generating high-quality images from natural language descriptions. However, these models are highly vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which can bypass safety measures and produce harmful content. Despite various defensive strategies, achieving robustness against attacks while maintaining practical utility in real-world applications remains a significant challenge. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study of the text encoder in the Stable Diffusion (SD) model, which is a widely used and representative text-to-image model. Our findings reveal that the [EOS] token acts as a semantic aggregator, exhibiting distinct distributional patterns between benign and adversarial prompts in its embedding space. Building on this insight, we introduce SafeGuider, a two-step framework designed for robust safety control without compromising generation quality. SafeGuider combines an embedding-level recognition model with a safety-aware feature erasure beam search algorithm. This integration enables the framework to maintain high-quality image generation for benign prompts while ensuring robust defense against both in-domain and out-of-domain attacks. SafeGuider demonstrates exceptional effectiveness in minimizing attack success rates, achieving a maximum rate of only 5.48\% across various attack scenarios. Moreover, instead of refusing to generate or producing black images for unsafe prompts, SafeGuider generates safe and meaningful images, enhancing its practical utility. In addition, SafeGuider is not limited to the SD model and can be effectively applied to other text-to-image models, such as the Flux model, demonstrating its versatility and adaptability across different architectures. We hope that SafeGuider can shed some light on the practical deployment of secure text-to-image systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM CCS 2025, Code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/pgqihere/safeguider)</p></details> |
| **[End-to-End Multi-Modal Diffusion Mamba](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13253v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current end-to-end multi-modal models utilize different encoders and decoders to process input and output information. This separation hinders the joint representation learning of various modalities. To unify multi-modal processing, we propose a novel architecture called MDM (Multi-modal Diffusion Mamba). MDM utilizes a Mamba-based multi-step selection diffusion model to progressively generate and refine modality-specific information through a unified variational autoencoder for both encoding and decoding. This innovative approach allows MDM to achieve superior performance when processing high-dimensional data, particularly in generating high-resolution images and extended text sequences simultaneously. Our evaluations in areas such as image generation, image captioning, visual question answering, text comprehension, and reasoning tasks demonstrate that MDM significantly outperforms existing end-to-end models (MonoFormer, LlamaGen, and Chameleon etc.) and competes effectively with SOTA models like GPT-4V, Gemini Pro, and Mistral. Our results validate MDM's effectiveness in unifying multi-modal processes while maintaining computational efficiency, establishing a new direction for end-to-end multi-modal architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[TempFlow-GRPO: When Timing Matters for GRPO in Flow Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04324v4)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent flow matching models for text-to-image generation have achieved remarkable quality, yet their integration with reinforcement learning for human preference alignment remains suboptimal, hindering fine-grained reward-based optimization. We observe that the key impediment to effective GRPO training of flow models is the temporal uniformity assumption in existing approaches: sparse terminal rewards with uniform credit assignment fail to capture the varying criticality of decisions across generation timesteps, resulting in inefficient exploration and suboptimal convergence. To remedy this shortcoming, we introduce \textbf{TempFlow-GRPO} (Temporal Flow GRPO), a principled GRPO framework that captures and exploits the temporal structure inherent in flow-based generation. TempFlow-GRPO introduces three key innovations: (i) a trajectory branching mechanism that provides process rewards by concentrating stochasticity at designated branching points, enabling precise credit assignment without requiring specialized intermediate reward models; (ii) a noise-aware weighting scheme that modulates policy optimization according to the intrinsic exploration potential of each timestep, prioritizing learning during high-impact early stages while ensuring stable refinement in later phases; and (iii) a seed group strategy that controls for initialization effects to isolate exploration contributions. These innovations endow the model with temporally-aware optimization that respects the underlying generative dynamics, leading to state-of-the-art performance in human preference alignment and text-to-image benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Text-to-Image Generation with Input-Side Inference-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12041v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have achieved impressive results, yet existing models often struggle with simple or underspecified prompts, leading to suboptimal image-text alignment, aesthetics, and quality. We propose a prompt rewriting framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to refine user inputs before feeding them into T2I backbones. Our approach introduces a carefully designed reward system and an iterative direct preference optimization (DPO) training pipeline, enabling the rewriter to enhance prompts without requiring supervised fine-tuning data. We evaluate our method across diverse T2I models and benchmarks. Results show that our prompt rewriter consistently improves image-text alignment, visual quality, and aesthetics, outperforming strong baselines. Furthermore, we demonstrate strong transferability by showing that a prompt rewriter trained on one T2I backbone generalizes effectively to others without needing to be retrained. We also systematically study scalability, evaluating how performance gains scale with the capacity of the large LLM used as the rewriter. These findings highlight that prompt rewriting is an effective, scalable, and practical model-agnostic strategy for improving T2I systems. We plan to release the code and trained prompt rewriters soon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion-Classifier Synergy: Reward-Aligned Learning via Mutual Boosting Loop for FSCIL](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03608v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to sequentially learn new classes from minimal examples without forgetting prior knowledge, a task complicated by the stability-plasticity dilemma and data scarcity. Current FSCIL methods often struggle with generalization due to their reliance on limited datasets. While diffusion models offer a path for data augmentation, their direct application can lead to semantic misalignment or ineffective guidance. This paper introduces Diffusion-Classifier Synergy (DCS), a novel framework that establishes a mutual boosting loop between diffusion model and FSCIL classifier. DCS utilizes a reward-aligned learning strategy, where a dynamic, multi-faceted reward function derived from the classifier's state directs the diffusion model. This reward system operates at two levels: the feature level ensures semantic coherence and diversity using prototype-anchored maximum mean discrepancy and dimension-wise variance matching, while the logits level promotes exploratory image generation and enhances inter-class discriminability through confidence recalibration and cross-session confusion-aware mechanisms. This co-evolutionary process, where generated images refine the classifier and an improved classifier state yields better reward signals, demonstrably achieves state-of-the-art performance on FSCIL benchmarks, significantly enhancing both knowledge retention and new class learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Counting Hallucinations in Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13080v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generative tasks, such as image and video synthesis. However, they still often produce hallucinated samples (hallucinations) that conflict with real-world knowledge, such as generating an implausible duplicate cup floating beside another cup. Despite their prevalence, the lack of feasible methodologies for systematically quantifying such hallucinations hinders progress in addressing this challenge and obscures potential pathways for designing next-generation generative models under factual constraints. In this work, we bridge this gap by focusing on a specific form of hallucination, which we term counting hallucination, referring to the generation of an incorrect number of instances or structured objects, such as a hand image with six fingers, despite such patterns being absent from the training data. To this end, we construct a dataset suite CountHalluSet, with well-defined counting criteria, comprising ToyShape, SimObject, and RealHand. Using these datasets, we develop a standardized evaluation protocol for quantifying counting hallucinations, and systematically examine how different sampling conditions in DPMs, including solver type, ODE solver order, sampling steps, and initial noise, affect counting hallucination levels. Furthermore, we analyze their correlation with common evaluation metrics such as FID, revealing that this widely used image quality metric fails to capture counting hallucinations consistently. This work aims to take the first step toward systematically quantifying hallucinations in diffusion models and offer new insights into the investigation of hallucination phenomena in image generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniFusion: Vision-Language Model as Unified Encoder in Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12789v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although recent advances in visual generation have been remarkable, most existing architectures still depend on distinct encoders for images and text. This separation constrains diffusion models' ability to perform cross-modal reasoning and knowledge transfer. Prior attempts to bridge this gap often use the last layer information from VLM, employ multiple visual encoders, or train large unified models jointly for text and image generation, which demands substantial computational resources and large-scale data, limiting its accessibility.We present UniFusion, a diffusion-based generative model conditioned on a frozen large vision-language model (VLM) that serves as a unified multimodal encoder. At the core of UniFusion is the Layerwise Attention Pooling (LAP) mechanism that extracts both high level semantics and low level details from text and visual tokens of a frozen VLM to condition a diffusion generative model. We demonstrate that LAP outperforms other shallow fusion architectures on text-image alignment for generation and faithful transfer of visual information from VLM to the diffusion model which is key for editing. We propose VLM-Enabled Rewriting Injection with Flexibile Inference (VERIFI), which conditions a diffusion transformer (DiT) only on the text tokens generated by the VLM during in-model prompt rewriting. VERIFI combines the alignment of the conditioning distribution with the VLM's reasoning capabilities for increased capabilities and flexibility at inference. In addition, finetuning on editing task not only improves text-image alignment for generation, indicative of cross-modality knowledge transfer, but also exhibits tremendous generalization capabilities. Our model when trained on single image editing, zero-shot generalizes to multiple image references further motivating the unified encoder design of UniFusion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page at https://thekevinli.github.io/unifusion/</p></details> |
| **[LayerSync: Self-aligning Intermediate Layers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12581v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose LayerSync, a domain-agnostic approach for improving the generation quality and the training efficiency of diffusion models. Prior studies have highlighted the connection between the quality of generation and the representations learned by diffusion models, showing that external guidance on model intermediate representations accelerates training. We reconceptualize this paradigm by regularizing diffusion models with their own intermediate representations. Building on the observation that representation quality varies across diffusion model layers, we show that the most semantically rich representations can act as an intrinsic guidance for weaker ones, reducing the need for external supervision. Our approach, LayerSync, is a self-sufficient, plug-and-play regularizer term with no overhead on diffusion model training and generalizes beyond the visual domain to other modalities. LayerSync requires no pretrained models nor additional data. We extensively evaluate the method on image generation and demonstrate its applicability to other domains such as audio, video, and motion generation. We show that it consistently improves the generation quality and the training efficiency. For example, we speed up the training of flow-based transformer by over 8.75x on ImageNet dataset and improved the generation quality by 23.6%.

| **[Local Background Features Matter in Out-of-Distribution Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12259v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial when deploying deep neural networks in the real world to ensure the reliability and safety of their applications. One main challenge in OOD detection is that neural network models often produce overconfident predictions on OOD data. While some methods using auxiliary OOD datasets or generating fake OOD images have shown promising OOD detection performance, they are limited by the high costs of data collection and training. In this study, we propose a novel and effective OOD detection method that utilizes local background features as fake OOD features for model training. Inspired by the observation that OOD images generally share similar background regions with ID images, the background features are extracted from ID images as simulated OOD visual representations during training based on the local invariance of convolution. Through being optimized to reduce the $L_2$-norm of these background features, the neural networks are able to alleviate the overconfidence issue on OOD data. Extensive experiments on multiple standard OOD detection benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of our method and its wide combinatorial compatibility with existing post-hoc methods, with new state-of-the-art performance achieved from our method.</p></details> |  |
| **[BIGFix: Bidirectional Image Generation with Token Fixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12231v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image and video generation have raised significant interest from both academia and industry. A key challenge in this field is improving inference efficiency, as model size and the number of inference steps directly impact the commercial viability of generative models while also posing fundamental scientific challenges. A promising direction involves combining auto-regressive sequential token modeling with multi-token prediction per step, reducing inference time by up to an order of magnitude. However, predicting multiple tokens in parallel can introduce structural inconsistencies due to token incompatibilities, as capturing complex joint dependencies during training remains challenging. Traditionally, once tokens are sampled, there is no mechanism to backtrack and refine erroneous predictions. We propose a method for self-correcting image generation by iteratively refining sampled tokens. We achieve this with a novel training scheme that injects random tokens in the context, improving robustness and enabling token fixing during sampling. Our method preserves the efficiency benefits of parallel token prediction while significantly enhancing generation quality. We evaluate our approach on image generation using the ImageNet-256 and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as on video generation with UCF-101 and NuScenes, demonstrating substantial improvements across both modalities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion: Fast Generation with Interpretable Diffusion Trajectory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12220v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved impressive success in high-fidelity image generation but suffer from slow sampling due to their inherently iterative denoising process. While recent one-step methods accelerate inference by learning direct noise-to-image mappings, they sacrifice the interpretability and fine-grained control intrinsic to diffusion dynamics, key advantages that enable applications like editable generation. To resolve this dichotomy, we introduce \textbf{Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion}, a novel framework that achieves both one-step sampling and interpretable generative trajectories. Grounded in Koopman operator theory, our method lifts the nonlinear diffusion dynamics into a latent space where evolution is governed by globally linear operators, enabling closed-form trajectory solutions. This formulation not only eliminates iterative sampling but also provides full access to intermediate states, allowing manual intervention during generation. To model the multi-scale nature of images, we design a hierarchical architecture that disentangles generative dynamics across spatial resolutions via scale-specific Koopman subspaces, capturing coarse-to-fine details systematically. We empirically show that the Hierarchical Koopman Diffusion not only achieves competitive one-step generation performance but also provides a principled mechanism for interpreting and manipulating the generative process through spectral analysis. Our framework bridges the gap between fast sampling and interpretability in diffusion models, paving the way for explainable image synthesis in generative modeling.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Finding Dori: Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models Is Not Local](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16880v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models (DMs) have achieved remarkable success in image generation. However, concerns about data privacy and intellectual property remain due to their potential to inadvertently memorize and replicate training data. Recent mitigation efforts have focused on identifying and pruning weights responsible for triggering verbatim training data replication, based on the assumption that memorization can be localized. We challenge this assumption and demonstrate that, even after such pruning, small perturbations to the text embeddings of previously mitigated prompts can re-trigger data replication, revealing the fragility of such defenses. Our further analysis then provides multiple indications that memorization is indeed not inherently local: (1) replication triggers for memorized images are distributed throughout text embedding space; (2) embeddings yielding the same replicated image produce divergent model activations; and (3) different pruning methods identify inconsistent sets of memorization-related weights for the same image. Finally, we show that bypassing the locality assumption enables more robust mitigation through adversarial fine-tuning. These findings provide new insights into the nature of memorization in text-to-image DMs and inform the development of more reliable mitigations against DM memorization.</p></details> |  |

While these systems have shown remarkable capabilities in enhancing generation quality through reference images, protecting visual datasets from unauthorized use in such systems remains a challenging problem. Traditional digital watermarking approaches face limitations in RAIG systems, as the complex feature extraction and recombination processes fail to preserve watermark signals during generation. To address these challenges, we propose ImageSentinel, a novel framework for protecting visual datasets in RAIG. Our framework synthesizes sentinel images that maintain visual consistency with the original dataset. These sentinels enable protection verification through randomly generated character sequences that serve as retrieval keys. To ensure seamless integration, we leverage vision-language models to generate the sentinel images. Experimental results demonstrate that ImageSentinel effectively detects unauthorized dataset usage while preserving generation quality for authorized applications.

Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning models, has been widely adopted in applications such as crop monitoring, pest detection, and yield prediction. Among recent generative models, diffusion models have demonstrated considerable potential in agricultural image processing, data augmentation, and remote sensing analysis. Compared to traditional generative adversarial networks (GANs), diffusion models exhibit greater training stability and superior image generation quality, effectively addressing challenges such as limited annotated datasets and imbalanced sample distributions in agricultural scenarios. This paper reviews recent advancements in the application of diffusion models within agriculture, focusing on their roles in crop disease and pest detection, remote sensing image enhancement, crop growth prediction, and agricultural resource management. Diffusion models have been found useful in improving tasks like image generation, denoising, and data augmentation in agriculture, especially when environmental noise or variability is present. While their high computational requirements and limited generalizability across domains remain concerns, the approach is gradually proving effective in real-world applications such as precision crop monitoring. As research progresses, these models may help support sustainable agriculture and address emerging challenges in food systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neon: Negative Extrapolation From Self-Training Improves Image Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03597v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling generative AI models is bottlenecked by the scarcity of high-quality training data. The ease of synthesizing from a generative model suggests using (unverified) synthetic data to augment a limited corpus of real data for the purpose of fine-tuning in the hope of improving performance. Unfortunately, however, the resulting positive feedback loop leads to model autophagy disorder (MAD, aka model collapse) that results in a rapid degradation in sample quality and/or diversity. In this paper, we introduce Neon (for Negative Extrapolation frOm self-traiNing), a new learning method that turns the degradation from self-training into a powerful signal for self-improvement. Given a base model, Neon first fine-tunes it on its own self-synthesized data but then, counterintuitively, reverses its gradient updates to extrapolate away from the degraded weights. We prove that Neon works because typical inference samplers that favor high-probability regions create a predictable anti-alignment between the synthetic and real data population gradients, which negative extrapolation corrects to better align the model with the true data distribution. Neon is remarkably easy to implement via a simple post-hoc merge that requires no new real data, works effectively with as few as 1k synthetic samples, and typically uses less than 1% additional training compute. We demonstrate Neon's universality across a range of architectures (diffusion, flow matching, autoregressive, and inductive moment matching models) and datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-10, and FFHQ). In particular, on ImageNet 256x256, Neon elevates the xAR-L model to a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.02 with only 0.36% additional training compute.
