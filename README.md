| **[Enhanced Generative Model Evaluation with Clipped Density and Coverage](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01761v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although generative models have made remarkable progress in recent years, their use in critical applications has been hindered by an inability to reliably evaluate the quality of their generated samples. Quality refers to at least two complementary concepts: fidelity and coverage. Current quality metrics often lack reliable, interpretable values due to an absence of calibration or insufficient robustness to outliers. To address these shortcomings, we introduce two novel metrics: Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage. By clipping individual sample contributions, as well as the radii of nearest neighbor balls for fidelity, our metrics prevent out-of-distribution samples from biasing the aggregated values. Through analytical and empirical calibration, these metrics demonstrate linear score degradation as the proportion of bad samples increases. Thus, they can be straightforwardly interpreted as equivalent proportions of good samples. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that Clipped Density and Clipped Coverage outperform existing methods in terms of robustness, sensitivity, and interpretability when evaluating generative models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization using CLIP-Based Semantic Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14889v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Web-Scale Multimodal Summarization, a lightweight framework for generating summaries by combining retrieved text and image data from web sources. Given a user-defined topic, the system performs parallel web, news, and image searches. Retrieved images are ranked using a fine-tuned CLIP model to measure semantic alignment with topic and text. Optional BLIP captioning enables image-only summaries for stronger multimodal coherence.The pipeline supports features such as adjustable fetch limits, semantic filtering, summary styling, and downloading structured outputs. We expose the system via a Gradio-based API with controllable parameters and preconfigured presets.Evaluation on 500 image-caption pairs with 20:1 contrastive negatives yields a ROC-AUC of 0.9270, an F1-score of 0.6504, and an accuracy of 96.99%, demonstrating strong multimodal alignment. This work provides a configurable, deployable tool for web-scale summarization that integrates language, retrieval, and vision models in a user-extensible pipeline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computable Bernstein Certificates for Cross-Fitted Clipped Covariance Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14020v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study operator-norm covariance estimation from heavy-tailed samples that may include a small fraction of arbitrary outliers. A simple and widely used safeguard is \emph{Euclidean norm clipping}, but its accuracy depends critically on an unknown clipping level. We propose a cross-fitted clipped covariance estimator equipped with \emph{fully computable} Bernstein-type deviation certificates, enabling principled data-driven tuning via a selector (\emph{MinUpper}) that balances certified stochastic error and a robust hold-out proxy for clipping bias. The resulting procedure adapts to intrinsic complexity measures such as effective rank under mild tail regularity and retains meaningful guarantees under only finite fourth moments. Experiments on contaminated spiked-covariance benchmarks illustrate stable performance and competitive accuracy across regimes.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear and Latent-Linear Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01168v7)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) verifiable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of prediction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a seemingly-naive procedure can simultaneously offer all three desiderata. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc procedure in which we surgically manipulate the spectrum of the linear system after it was learned using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectral clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after any eigenvalues whose magnitude exceeds one have been clipped to one (without altering the eigenvectors). We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn nonlinear dynamical systems that can generate stable predictions of nonlinear phenomena, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate predictive dynamics that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our code and datasets can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/spec_clip.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Deepfakes with Multivariate Soft Blending and CLIP-based Image-Text Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15903v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of highly realistic facial forgeries necessitates robust detection methods. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited accuracy and poor generalization due to significant distribution shifts among samples generated by diverse forgery techniques. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation with CLIP-guided Forgery Intensity Estimation (MSBA-CLIP) framework. Our method leverages the multimodal alignment capabilities of CLIP to capture subtle forgery traces. We introduce a Multivariate and Soft Blending Augmentation (MSBA) strategy that synthesizes images by blending forgeries from multiple methods with random weights, forcing the model to learn generalizable patterns. Furthermore, a dedicated Multivariate Forgery Intensity Estimation (MFIE) module is designed to explicitly guide the model in learning features related to varied forgery modes and intensities. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. On in-domain tests, our method improves Accuracy and AUC by 3.32\% and 4.02\%, respectively, over the best baseline. In cross-domain evaluations across five datasets, it achieves an average AUC gain of 3.27\%. Ablation studies confirm the efficacy of both proposed components. While the reliance on a large vision-language model entails higher computational cost, our work presents a significant step towards more generalizable and robust deepfake detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Brain Signal Generation for Visual Prosthesis with CLIP Guided Multimodal Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00787v5)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual prostheses hold great promise for restoring vision in blind individuals. While researchers have successfully utilized M/EEG signals to evoke visual perceptions during the brain decoding stage of visual prostheses, the complementary process of converting images into M/EEG signals in the brain encoding stage remains largely unexplored, hindering the formation of a complete functional pipeline. In this work, we present a novel image-to-brain signal framework that generates M/EEG from images by leveraging the diffusion transformer architecture enhanced with cross-attention mechanisms. Specifically, we employ a diffusion transformer (DiT) architecture based on denoising diffusion implicit models (DDIM) to achieve brain signal generation. To realize the goal of image-to-brain signal conversion, we use cross-attention mechanisms to align brain signal embeddings with CLIP image embeddings. Moreover, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to generate image captions, and concatenate the resulting CLIP text embeddings with CLIP image embeddings to form unified embeddings for cross-attention alignment, enabling our model to capture core semantic information. Moreover, to capture core semantic information, we use large language models (LLMs) to generate descriptive and semantically accurate captions for images. Furthermore, we introduce a learnable spatio-temporal position encoding that combines brain region embeddings with temporal embeddings to capture both spatial and temporal characteristics of brain signals. We evaluate the framework on two multimodal benchmark datasets (THINGS-EEG2 and THINGS-MEG) and demonstrate that it generates biologically plausible brain signals.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-tuning for CLIP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12461v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have shown that CLIP model's adversarial robustness in zero-shot classification tasks can be enhanced by adversarially fine-tuning its image encoder with adversarial examples (AEs), which are generated by minimizing the cosine similarity between images and a hand-crafted template (e.g., ''A photo of a {label}''). However, it has been shown that the cosine similarity between a single image and a single hand-crafted template is insufficient to measure the similarity for image-text pairs. Building on this, in this paper, we find that the AEs generated using cosine similarity may fail to fool CLIP when the similarity metric is replaced with semantically enriched alternatives, making the image encoder fine-tuned with these AEs less robust. To overcome this issue, we first propose a semantic-ensemble attack to generate semantic-aware AEs by minimizing the average similarity between the original image and an ensemble of refined textual descriptions. These descriptions are initially generated by a foundation model to capture core semantic features beyond hand-crafted templates and are then refined to reduce hallucinations. To this end, we propose Semantic-aware Adversarial Fine-Tuning (SAFT), which fine-tunes CLIP's image encoder with semantic-aware AEs. Extensive experiments show that SAFT outperforms current methods, achieving substantial improvements in zero-shot adversarial robustness across 16 datasets. Our code is available at: https://github.com/tmlr-group/SAFT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthetic Image Detection with CLIP: Understanding and Assessing Predictive Cues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12381v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent generative models produce near-photorealistic images, challenging the trustworthiness of photographs. Synthetic image detection (SID) has thus become an important area of research. Prior work has highlighted how synthetic images differ from real photographs--unfortunately, SID methods often struggle to generalize to novel generative models and often perform poorly in practical settings. CLIP, a foundational vision-language model which yields semantically rich image-text embeddings, shows strong accuracy and generalization for SID. Yet, the underlying relevant cues embedded in CLIP-features remain unknown. It is unclear, whether CLIP-based detectors simply detect strong visual artifacts or exploit subtle semantic biases, both of which would render them useless in practical settings or on generative models of high quality. We introduce SynthCLIC, a paired dataset of real photographs and high-quality synthetic counterparts from recent diffusion models, designed to reduce semantic bias in SID. Using an interpretable linear head with de-correlated activations and a text-grounded concept-model, we analyze what CLIP-based detectors learn. CLIP-based linear detectors reach 0.96 mAP on a GAN-based benchmark but only 0.92 on our high-quality diffusion dataset SynthCLIC, and generalization across generator families drops to as low as 0.37 mAP. We find that the detectors primarily rely on high-level photographic attributes (e.g., minimalist style, lens flare, or depth layering), rather than overt generator-specific artifacts. CLIP-based detectors perform well overall but generalize unevenly across diverse generative architectures. This highlights the need for continual model updates and broader training exposure, while reinforcing CLIP-based approaches as a strong foundation for more universal, robust SID.</p></details> | 11 figures; 23 pages |
| **[ArtContext: Contextualizing Artworks with Open-Access Art History Articles and Wikidata Knowledge through a LoRA-Tuned CLIP Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11349v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many Art History articles discuss artworks in general as well as specific parts of works, such as layout, iconography, or material culture. However, when viewing an artwork, it is not trivial to identify what different articles have said about the piece. Therefore, we propose ArtContext, a pipeline for taking a corpus of Open-Access Art History articles and Wikidata Knowledge and annotating Artworks with this information. We do this using a novel corpus collection pipeline, then learn a bespoke CLIP model adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to make it domain-specific. We show that the new model, PaintingCLIP, which is weakly supervised by the collected corpus, outperforms CLIP and provides context for a given artwork. The proposed pipeline is generalisable and can be readily applied to numerous humanities areas.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Gradient Clipping Becomes a Control Mechanism for Differential Privacy in Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10584v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving training on sensitive data commonly relies on differentially private stochastic optimization with gradient clipping and Gaussian noise. The clipping threshold is a critical control knob: if set too small, systematic over-clipping induces optimization bias; if too large, injected noise dominates updates and degrades accuracy. Existing adaptive clipping methods often depend on per-example gradient norm statistics, adding computational overhead and introducing sensitivity to datasets and architectures. We propose a control-driven clipping strategy that adapts the threshold using a lightweight, weight-only spectral diagnostic computed from model parameters. At periodic probe steps, the method analyzes a designated weight matrix via spectral decomposition and estimates a heavy-tailed spectral indicator associated with training stability. This indicator is smoothed over time and fed into a bounded feedback controller that updates the clipping threshold multiplicatively in the log domain. Because the controller uses only parameters produced during privacy-preserving training, the resulting threshold updates are post-processing and do not increase privacy loss beyond that of the underlying DP optimizer under standard composition accounting.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript is under review in the Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence journal</p></details> |
| **[Closing the Confusion Loop: CLIP-Guided Alignment for Source-Free Domain Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08730v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) tackles the problem of adapting a pre-trained source model to an unlabeled target domain without accessing any source data, which is quite suitable for the field of data security. Although recent advances have shown that pseudo-labeling strategies can be effective, they often fail in fine-grained scenarios due to subtle inter-class similarities. A critical but underexplored issue is the presence of asymmetric and dynamic class confusion, where visually similar classes are unequally and inconsistently misclassified by the source model. Existing methods typically ignore such confusion patterns, leading to noisy pseudo-labels and poor target discrimination. To address this, we propose CLIP-Guided Alignment(CGA), a novel framework that explicitly models and mitigates class confusion in SFDA. Generally, our method consists of three parts: (1) MCA: detects first directional confusion pairs by analyzing the predictions of the source model in the target domain; (2) MCC: leverages CLIP to construct confusion-aware textual prompts (e.g. a truck that looks like a bus), enabling more context-sensitive pseudo-labeling; and (3) FAM: builds confusion-guided feature banks for both CLIP and the source model and aligns them using contrastive learning to reduce ambiguity in the representation space. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate that CGA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art SFDA methods, with especially notable gains in confusion-prone and fine-grained scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling inter-class confusion for effective source-free adaptation. Our code can be find at https://github.com/soloiro/CGA</p></details> |  |
| **[UniLiP: Adapting CLIP for Unified Multimodal Understanding, Generation and Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23278v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose UniLIP, a unified framework that adapts CLIP for multimodal understanding, generation and editing. Although CLIP excels at understanding, it lacks reconstruction abilities required to be a unified visual encoder. However, previous CLIP-based unified methods fail to balance understanding and reconstruction, leading to semantic degradation or inconsistent reconstructions. In contrast, we introduce a novel two-stage training scheme with a self-distillation strategy that progressively endows CLIP with high-fidelity reconstruction abilities while preserving its original comprehension performance. For enhanced reasoning and consistency in generation and editing, we further develop a dual-condition architecture built upon the MetaQuery framework. Our architecture jointly utilizes multimodal hidden states for rich contextual details and learnable query embeddings to harness the powerful reasoning abilities of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Leveraging advanced image representation and architectural design, UniLIP demonstrates superior instruction following and edit fidelity. With only 1B and 3B parameters, UniLIP can outperform larger unified models such as BAGEL (7B) and Uniworld-V1 (12B), achieving state-of-the-art performance of 0.90 on GenEval, 0.63 on WISE, and 3.94 on ImgEdit. These results demonstrate that UniLIP successfully expands the application of CLIP, establishing its continuous features to not only serve as the optimal choice for understanding tasks but also achieve highly competitive performance in generation and editing tasks.

| **[Visual Word Sense Disambiguation with CLIP through Dual-Channel Text Prompting and Image Augmentations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06799v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ambiguity poses persistent challenges in natural language understanding for large language models (LLMs). To better understand how lexical ambiguity can be resolved through the visual domain, we develop an interpretable Visual Word Sense Disambiguation (VWSD) framework. The model leverages CLIP to project ambiguous language and candidate images into a shared multimodal space. We enrich textual embeddings using a dual-channel ensemble of semantic and photo-based prompts with WordNet synonyms, while image embeddings are refined through robust test-time augmentations. We then use cosine similarity to determine the image that best aligns with the ambiguous text. When evaluated on the SemEval-2023 VWSD dataset, enriching the embeddings raises the MRR from 0.7227 to 0.7590 and the Hit Rate from 0.5810 to 0.6220. Ablation studies reveal that dual-channel prompting provides strong, low-latency performance, whereas aggressive image augmentation yields only marginal gains. Additional experiments with WordNet definitions and multilingual prompt ensembles further suggest that noisy external signals tend to dilute semantic specificity, reinforcing the effectiveness of precise, CLIP-aligned prompts for visual word sense disambiguation.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures, pending journal/workshop submission</p></details> |
| **[FaA-CAF: Modular Single-RF-Chain Near-Field mmWave Sensing via Clip-On Antenna Fabric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06767v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sliced Rényi Pufferfish Privacy: Directional Additive Noise Mechanism and Private Learning with Gradient Clipping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01115v3)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the design of a privatization mechanism and privacy accounting in the Pufferfish Privacy (PP) family. Specifically, motivated by the curse of dimensionality and lack of practical composition tools for iterative learning in the recent Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (RPP) framework, we propose Sliced Renyi Pufferfish Privacy (SRPP). SRPP preserves PP/RPP semantics (customizable secrets with probability-aware secret-dataset relationships) while replacing high-dimensional Renyi divergence with projection-based quantification via two sliced measures, Average SRPP and Joint SRPP. We develop sliced Wasserstein mechanisms, yielding sound SRPP certificates and closed-form Gaussian noise calibration. For iterative learning systems, we introduce an SRPP-SGD scheme with gradient clipping and new accountants based on History-Uniform Caps (HUC) and a subsampling-aware variant (sa-HUC), enabling decompose-then-compose privatization and additive composition under a common slicing geometry. Experiments on static and iterative privatization show that the proposed framework exhibits favorable privacy-utility trade-offs, as well as practical scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLIP-Map: Structured Matrix Mapping for Parameter-Efficient CLIP Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05909v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has achieved widely applications in various computer vision tasks, e.g., text-to-image generation, Image-Text retrieval and Image captioning. However, CLIP suffers from high memory and computation cost, which prohibits its usage to the resource-limited application scenarios. Existing CLIP compression methods typically reduce the size of pre-trained CLIP weights by selecting their subset as weight inheritance for further retraining via mask optimization or important weight measurement. However, these select-based weight inheritance often compromises the feature presentation ability, especially on the extreme compression. In this paper, we propose a novel mapping-based CLIP compression framework, CLIP-Map. It leverages learnable matrices to map and combine pretrained weights by Full-Mapping with Kronecker Factorization, aiming to preserve as much information from the original weights as possible. To mitigate the optimization challenges introduced by the learnable mapping, we propose Diagonal Inheritance Initialization to reduce the distribution shifting problem for efficient and effective mapping learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CLIP-Map outperforms select-based frameworks across various compression ratios, with particularly significant gains observed under high compression settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image-to-Image Translation with Diffusion Transformers and CLIP-Based Image Conditioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16001v2)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-image translation aims to learn a mapping between a source and a target domain, enabling tasks such as style transfer, appearance transformation, and domain adaptation. In this work, we explore a diffusion-based framework for image-to-image translation by adapting Diffusion Transformers (DiT), which combine the denoising capabilities of diffusion models with the global modeling power of transformers. To guide the translation process, we condition the model on image embeddings extracted from a pre-trained CLIP encoder, allowing for fine-grained and structurally consistent translations without relying on text or class labels. We incorporate both a CLIP similarity loss to enforce semantic consistency and an LPIPS perceptual loss to enhance visual fidelity during training. We validate our approach on two benchmark datasets: face2comics, which translates real human faces to comic-style illustrations, and edges2shoes, which translates edge maps to realistic shoe images. Experimental results demonstrate that DiT, combined with CLIP-based conditioning and perceptual similarity objectives, achieves high-quality, semantically faithful translations, offering a promising alternative to GAN-based models for paired image-to-image translation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in: 2025 6th International Conference on Computer Vision, Image and Deep Learning (CVIDL)</p></details> |
| **[Tight Long-Term Tail Decay of (Clipped) SGD in Non-Convex Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05657v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of tail behaviour of SGD-induced processes has been attracting a lot of interest, due to offering strong guarantees with respect to individual runs of an algorithm. While many works provide high-probability guarantees, quantifying the error rate for a fixed probability threshold, there is a lack of work directly studying the probability of failure, i.e., quantifying the tail decay rate for a fixed error threshold. Moreover, existing results are of finite-time nature, limiting their ability to capture the true long-term tail decay which is more informative for modern learning models, typically trained for millions of iterations. Our work closes these gaps, by studying the long-term tail decay of SGD-based methods through the lens of large deviations theory, establishing several strong results in the process. First, we provide an upper bound on the tails of the gradient norm-squared of the best iterate produced by (vanilla) SGD, for non-convex costs and bounded noise, with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t/\log(t)}$. Next, we relax the noise assumption by considering clipped SGD (c-SGD) under heavy-tailed noise with bounded moment of order $p \in (1,2]$, showing an upper bound with long-term decay at rate $e^{-t^{β_p}/\log(t)}$, where $β_p = \frac{4(p-1)}{3p-2}$ for $p \in (1,2)$ and $e^{-t/\log^2(t)}$ for $p = 2$. Finally, we provide lower bounds on the tail decay, at rate $e^{-t}$, showing that our rates for both SGD and c-SGD are tight, up to poly-logarithmic factors. Notably, our results demonstrate an order of magnitude faster long-term tail decay compared to existing work based on finite-time bounds, which show rates $e^{-\sqrt{t}}$ and $e^{-t^{β_p/2}}$, $p \in (1,2]$, for SGD and c-SGD, respectively. As such, we uncover regimes where the tails decay much faster than previously known, providing stronger long-term guarantees for individual runs.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[CoPE: Clipped RoPE as A Scalable Free Lunch for Long Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05258v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) is a key component of context scaling in Large Language Models (LLMs). While various methods have been proposed to adapt RoPE to longer contexts, their guiding principles generally fall into two categories: (1) out-of-distribution (OOD) mitigation, which scales RoPE frequencies to accommodate unseen positions, and (2) Semantic Modeling, which posits that the attention scores computed with RoPE should always prioritize semantically similar tokens. In this work, we unify these seemingly distinct objectives through a minimalist intervention, namely CoPE: soft clipping lowfrequency components of RoPE. CoPE not only eliminates OOD outliers and refines semantic signals, but also prevents spectral leakage caused by hard clipping. Extensive experiments demonstrate that simply applying our soft clipping strategy to RoPE yields significant performance gains that scale up to 256k context length, validating our theoretical analysis and establishing CoPE as a new state-of-the-art for length generalization. Our code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/hrlics/CoPE.</p></details> |  |
| **[DGS-Net: Distillation-Guided Gradient Surgery for CLIP Fine-Tuning in AI-Generated Image Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13108v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress of generative models such as GANs and diffusion models has led to the widespread proliferation of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation, privacy violations, and trust erosion in digital media. Although large-scale multimodal models like CLIP offer strong transferable representations for detecting synthetic content, fine-tuning them often induces catastrophic forgetting, which degrades pre-trained priors and limits cross-domain generalization. To address this issue, we propose the Distillation-guided Gradient Surgery Network (DGS-Net), a novel framework that preserves transferable pre-trained priors while suppressing task-irrelevant components. Specifically, we introduce a gradient-space decomposition that separates harmful and beneficial descent directions during optimization. By projecting task gradients onto the orthogonal complement of harmful directions and aligning with beneficial ones distilled from a frozen CLIP encoder, DGS-Net achieves unified optimization of prior preservation and irrelevant suppression. Extensive experiments on 50 generative models demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches by an average margin of 6.6, achieving superior detection performance and generalization across diverse generation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Gradient Norm Clipping & Non-Euclidean $(L_0,L_1)$-Smoothness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01913v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a hybrid non-Euclidean optimization method which generalizes gradient norm clipping by combining steepest descent and conditional gradient approaches. The method achieves the best of both worlds by establishing a descent property under a generalized notion of ($L_0$,$L_1$)-smoothness. Weight decay is incorporated in a principled manner by identifying a connection to the Frank-Wolfe short step. In the stochastic case, we show an order optimal $O(n^{-1/4})$ convergence rate by leveraging a momentum based gradient estimator. We discuss how to instantiate the algorithms for deep learning, which we dub Clipped Scion, and demonstrate their properties on image classification and language modeling. The code is available at https://github.com/LIONS-EPFL/ClippedScion.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less Precise Can Be More Reliable: A Systematic Evaluation of Quantization's Impact on CLIP Beyond Accuracy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21173v4)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as CLIP have revolutionized zero-shot classification and safety-critical tasks, including Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, their high computational cost hinders efficient real-world deployment. While quantization is a standard solution for efficiency, its broader impact on reliability metrics beyond simple Top-1 accuracy remains critically under-explored. In this study, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of VLM quantization across a comprehensive experimental suite of over 700k evaluation runs with varying configurations. We find that, contrary to the assumption that quantization's noise degrades performance, it can simultaneously improve accuracy, calibration, OOD detection, and robustness to noise, though not to covariate shift or spurious correlations. We leverage these counterintuitive findings to characterize the mechanics of quantization beyond simple regularization: we show that quantization dampens high-rank spectral components, compelling the model to rely more heavily on robust, low-rank features. Ultimately, this spectral filtering effect drives the observed improvements in generalization and noise tolerance, establishing a pathway to deploy faster, more reliable VLMs by utilizing quantization beyond its conventional role.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Explicit Uncertainty Modeling for Active CLIP Adaptation with Dual Prompt Tuning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04340v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained vision-language models such as CLIP exhibit strong transferability, yet adapting them to downstream image classification tasks under limited annotation budgets remains challenging. In active learning settings, the model must select the most informative samples for annotation from a large pool of unlabeled data. Existing approaches typically estimate uncertainty via entropy-based criteria or representation clustering, without explicitly modeling uncertainty from the model perspective. In this work, we propose a robust uncertainty modeling framework for active CLIP adaptation based on dual-prompt tuning. We introduce two learnable prompts in the textual branch of CLIP. The positive prompt enhances the discriminability of task-specific textual embeddings corresponding to light-weight tuned visual embeddings, improving classification reliability. Meanwhile, the negative prompt is trained in an reversed manner to explicitly model the probability that the predicted label is correct, providing a principled uncertainty signal for guiding active sample selection. Extensive experiments across different fine-tuning paradigms demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing active learning methods under the same annotation budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[UnHype: CLIP-Guided Hypernetworks for Dynamic LoRA Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03410v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale diffusion models have intensified concerns about their potential misuse, particularly in generating realistic yet harmful or socially disruptive content. This challenge has spurred growing interest in effective machine unlearning, the process of selectively removing specific knowledge or concepts from a model without compromising its overall generative capabilities. Among various approaches, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as an effective and efficient method for fine-tuning models toward targeted unlearning. However, LoRA-based methods often exhibit limited adaptability to concept semantics and struggle to balance removing closely related concepts with maintaining generalization across broader meanings. Moreover, these methods face scalability challenges when multiple concepts must be erased simultaneously. To address these limitations, we introduce UnHype, a framework that incorporates hypernetworks into single- and multi-concept LoRA training. The proposed architecture can be directly plugged into Stable Diffusion as well as modern flow-based text-to-image models, where it demonstrates stable training behavior and effective concept control. During inference, the hypernetwork dynamically generates adaptive LoRA weights based on the CLIP embedding, enabling more context-aware, scalable unlearning. We evaluate UnHype across several challenging tasks, including object erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content removal, demonstrating its effectiveness and versatility.

Current DIA analysis frameworks, however, require semi-supervised training within each run for peptide-spectrum match (PSM) re-scoring. This approach is prone to overfitting and lacks generalizability across diverse species and experimental conditions. Here, we present DIA-CLIP, a pre-trained model shifting the DIA analysis paradigm from semi-supervised training to universal cross-modal representation learning. By integrating dual-encoder contrastive learning framework with encoder-decoder architecture, DIA-CLIP establishes a unified cross-modal representation for peptides and corresponding spectral features, achieving high-precision, zero-shot PSM inference. Extensive evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that DIA-CLIP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tools, yielding up to a 45% increase in protein identification while achieving a 12% reduction in entrapment identifications. Moreover, DIA-CLIP holds immense potential for diverse practical applications, such as single-cell and spatial proteomics, where its enhanced identification depth facilitates the discovery of novel biomarkers and the elucidates of intricate cellular mechanisms.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |

We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations. Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.</p></details> |  |

However, despite the superior performance of transformer-based models over convolutional architectures, their limited interpretability remains a major obstacle to clinical trust and deployment. Existing explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, including gradient-based saliency methods and perturbation-based approaches, are often computationally expensive, require numerous forward passes, and frequently produce noisy or anatomically irrelevant explanations. To address these limitations, we propose XAI-CLIP, an ROI-guided perturbation framework that leverages multimodal vision-language model embeddings to localize clinically meaningful anatomical regions and guide the explanation process. By integrating language-informed region localization with medical image segmentation and applying targeted, region-aware perturbations, the proposed method generates clearer, boundary-aware saliency maps while substantially reducing computational overhead. Experiments conducted on the FLARE22 and CHAOS datasets demonstrate that XAI-CLIP achieves up to a 60\% reduction in runtime, a 44.6\% improvement in dice score, and a 96.7\% increase in Intersection-over-Union for occlusion-based explanations compared to conventional perturbation methods. Qualitative results further confirm cleaner and more anatomically consistent attribution maps with fewer artifacts, highlighting that the incorporation of multimodal vision-language representations into perturbation-based XAI frameworks significantly enhances both interpretability and efficiency, thereby enabling transparent and clinically deployable medical image segmentation systems.</p></details> |  |

However, this semantic similarity overlooks a critical yet underexplored cue: the magnitude of the CLIP image features, which we empirically find to exhibit a strong correlation with perceptual quality. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive fusion framework that complements cosine similarity with a magnitude-aware quality cue. Specifically, we first extract the absolute CLIP image features and apply a Box-Cox transformation to statistically normalize the feature distribution and mitigate semantic sensitivity. The resulting scalar summary serves as a semantically-normalized auxiliary cue that complements cosine-based prompt matching. To integrate both cues effectively, we further design a confidence-guided fusion scheme that adaptively weighs each term according to its relative strength. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark IQA datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms standard CLIP-based IQA and state-of-the-art baselines, without any task-specific training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We propose Clipping-Free Policy Optimization (CFPO), which replaces heuristic clipping with a convex quadratic penalty derived from Total Variation divergence constraints, yielding an everywhere-differentiable objective that enforces stable policy updates without hard boundaries. We evaluate CFPO across both reasoning and alignment settings. In reasoning, CFPO matches clipping-based methods on downstream benchmarks while extending the stable training regime. In alignment, CFPO mitigates verbosity exploitation and reduces capability degradation, while achieving competitive instruction-following performance. CFPO requires only a one-line code change and no additional hyperparameters. Our results suggest that CFPO is a promising drop-in alternative to clipping-based methods for LLM post-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 tables, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, their potential is limited by the next-token prediction (NTP) training paradigm. NTP optimizes single-token predictions and ignores semantic coherence across multiple tokens following a prefix. Consequently, fast weight models, which dynamically update their parameters to store contextual information, learn suboptimal representations that fail to capture long-range dependencies. We introduce REFINE (Reinforced Fast weIghts with Next sEquence prediction), a reinforcement learning framework that trains fast weight models under the next-sequence prediction (NSP) objective. REFINE selects informative token positions based on prediction entropy, generates multi-token rollouts, assigns self-supervised sequence-level rewards, and optimizes the model with group relative policy optimization (GRPO). REFINE is applicable throughout the training lifecycle of pre-trained language models: mid-training, post-training, and test-time training. Our experiments on LaCT-760M and DeltaNet-1.3B demonstrate that REFINE consistently outperforms supervised fine-tuning with NTP across needle-in-a-haystack retrieval, long-context question answering, and diverse tasks in LongBench. REFINE provides an effective and versatile framework for improving long-context modeling in fast weight architectures.</p></details> |  |

The complex physics of the deformable object makes this problem of cloth manipulation nontrivial. In order to create a general manipulation strategy that addresses a variety of shapes, sizes, fold and wrinkle patterns, in addition to the usual problems of appearance variations, it becomes important to carefully consider model structure and their implications for generalisation performance. In this paper, we present an approach to in-air cloth manipulation that uses a variation of a recently proposed reinforcement learning architecture, DreamerV2. Our implementation modifies this architecture to utilise surface normals input, in addition to modiying the replay buffer and data augmentation procedures. Taken together these modifications represent an enhancement to the world model used by the robot, addressing the physical complexity of the object being manipulated by the robot. We present evaluations both in simulation and in a zero-shot deployment of the trained policies in a physical robot setup, performing in-air unfolding of a variety of different cloth types, demonstrating the generalisation benefits of our proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Differential temporal difference (TD) learning algorithms are a major advance for average reward RL as they provide an efficient online method to learn the value functions associated with the average reward in both on-policy and off-policy settings. However, existing convergence guarantees require a local clock in learning rates tied to state visit counts, which practitioners do not use and does not extend beyond tabular settings. We address this limitation by proving the almost sure convergence of on-policy $n$-step differential TD for any $n$ using standard diminishing learning rates without a local clock. We then derive three sufficient conditions under which off-policy $n$-step differential TD also converges without a local clock. These results strengthen the theoretical foundations of differential TD and bring its convergence analysis closer to practical implementations.</p></details> |  |

These factors introduce significant decision complexity, which limits the adaptability of existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods. In many DRL algorithms, especially those involving value-based or actor-critic structures, the critic component plays a key role in guiding policy learning by estimating value functions. However, conventional critic models often use shallow architectures that map observations directly to scalar estimates, limiting their ability to handle multi-task complexity. In contrast, recent progress in inference-time scaling of Large Language Models (LLMs) has shown that generating intermediate reasoning steps can significantly improve decision quality. Motivated by this, we propose ReaCritic, a reasoning transformer-based critic-model scaling scheme that brings reasoning-like ability into DRL. ReaCritic performs horizontal reasoning over parallel state-action inputs and vertical reasoning through deep transformer stacks. It is compatible with a broad range of value-based and actor-critic DRL algorithms and enhances generalization in dynamic wireless environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReaCritic improves convergence speed and final performance across various HetNet settings and standard OpenAI Gym control tasks. The code of ReaCritic is available at https://github.com/NICE-HKU/ReaCritic.</p></details> |  |

MetaDOAR learns a compact state projection from per node structural embeddings to rapidly score and select a small subset of devices (a top-k partition) on which a conventional low-level actor performs focused beam search utilizing a critic agent. Selected candidate actions are evaluated with batched critic forwards and stored in an LRU cache keyed by a quantized state projection and local action identifiers, dramatically reducing redundant critic computation while preserving decision quality via conservative k-hop cache invalidation. Empirically, MetaDOAR attains higher player payoffs than SOTA baselines on large network topologies, without significant scaling issues in terms of memory usage or training time. This contribution provide a practical, theoretically motivated path to efficient hierarchical policy learning for large-scale networked decision problems.</p></details> |  |

While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a conference paper at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Yet existing approaches struggle to strike the right balance: methods that tightly enforce safety often cripple task performance, while those that prioritize reward leave safety constraints frequently violated, producing diffuse cost landscapes that flatten gradients and stall policy improvement. We introduce the Uncertain Safety Critic (USC), a novel approach that integrates uncertainty-aware modulation and refinement into critic training. By concentrating conservatism in uncertain and costly regions while preserving sharp gradients in safe areas, USC enables policies to achieve effective reward-safety trade-offs. Extensive experiments show that USC reduces safety violations by approximately 40% while maintaining competitive or higher rewards, and reduces the error between predicted and true cost gradients by approximately 83%, breaking the prevailing trade-off between safety and performance and paving the way for scalable safe RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted into AAMAS '26</p></details> |
| **[Vulnerability Analysis of Safe Reinforcement Learning via Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16543v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Safe reinforcement learning (Safe RL) aims to ensure policy performance while satisfying safety constraints. However, most existing Safe RL methods assume benign environments, making them vulnerable to adversarial perturbations commonly encountered in real-world settings. In addition, existing gradient-based adversarial attacks typically require access to the policy's gradient information, which is often impractical in real-world scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose an adversarial attack framework to reveal vulnerabilities of Safe RL policies. Using expert demonstrations and black-box environment interaction, our framework learns a constraint model and a surrogate (learner) policy, enabling gradient-based attack optimization without requiring the victim policy's internal gradients or the ground-truth safety constraints. We further provide theoretical analysis establishing feasibility and deriving perturbation bounds. Experiments on multiple Safe RL benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach under limited privileged access.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, supplementary material included</p></details> |

It aims to maintain electricity grid capacity limits and prevent congestion by financially incentivising end users to reduce or shift their energy consumption. The proposed framework adopts a hierarchical architecture in which a service provider adjusts hourly incentive rates based on wholesale electricity prices and aggregated residential load. The financial interests of both the service provider and end users are explicitly considered. A deep reinforcement learning approach is employed to learn optimal real-time incentive rates under explicit capacity constraints. Heterogeneous user preferences are modelled through appliance-level home energy management systems and dissatisfaction costs. Using real-world residential electricity consumption and price data from three households, simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces peak demand and smooths the aggregated load profile. This leads to an approximately 22.82% reduction in the peak-to-average ratio compared to the no-demand-response case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Parameterized Quantum State Preparation: A Comparative Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16523v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend directed quantum circuit synthesis (DQCS) with reinforcement learning from purely discrete gate selection to parameterized quantum state preparation with continuous single-qubit rotations \(R_x\), \(R_y\), and \(R_z\). We compare two training regimes: a one-stage agent that jointly selects the gate type, the affected qubit(s), and the rotation angle; and a two-stage variant that first proposes a discrete circuit and subsequently optimizes the rotation angles with Adam using parameter-shift gradients. Using Gymnasium and PennyLane, we evaluate Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Advantage Actor--Critic (A2C) on systems comprising two to ten qubits and on targets of increasing complexity with \(λ\) ranging from one to five. Whereas A2C does not learn effective policies in this setting, PPO succeeds under stable hyperparameters (one-stage: learning rate approximately \(5\times10^{-4}\) with a self-fidelity-error threshold of 0.01; two-stage: learning rate approximately \(10^{-4}\)). Both approaches reliably reconstruct computational basis states (between 83\% and 99\% success) and Bell states (between 61\% and 77\% success). However, scalability saturates for \(λ\) of approximately three to four and does not extend to ten-qubit targets even at \(λ=2\). The two-stage method offers only marginal accuracy gains while requiring around three times the runtime. For practicality under a fixed compute budget, we therefore recommend the one-stage PPO policy, provide explicit synthesized circuits, and contrast with a classical variational baseline to outline avenues for improved scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a short paper to be published at ICAART 2026</p></details> |
| **[Shrinking the Variance: Shrinkage Baselines for Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03710v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean reward for each prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (baseline), reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator. In practice, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages computed from the generations for each prompt in a batch. Motivated by Stein's paradox, we propose shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to improve per-prompt mean estimation accuracy, especially in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our baseline is a drop-in replacement for standard per-prompt mean baselines and requires no additional hyperparameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines consistently outperform empirical-mean baselines, producing lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Unlike quadrupeds or wheeled robots, humanoids experience high-energy impacts, complex whole-body contact, and large viewpoint changes during a fall, making recovery essential for continued operation. Existing methods fragment fall safety into separate problems such as fall avoidance, impact mitigation, and stand-up recovery, or rely on end-to-end policies trained without vision through reinforcement learning or imitation learning, often on flat terrain. At a deeper level, fall safety is treated as monolithic data complexity, coupling pose, dynamics, and terrain and requiring exhaustive coverage, limiting scalability and generalization. We present a unified fall safety approach that spans all phases of fall recovery. It builds on two insights: 1) Natural human fall and recovery poses are highly constrained and transferable from flat to complex terrain through alignment, and 2) Fast whole-body reactions require integrated perceptual-motor representations. We train a privileged teacher using sparse human demonstrations on flat terrain and simulated complex terrains, and distill it into a deployable student that relies only on egocentric depth and proprioception. The student learns how to react by matching the teacher's goal-in-context latent representation, which combines the next target pose with the local terrain, rather than separately encoding what it must perceive and how it must act. Results in simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid demonstrate robust, zero-shot fall safety across diverse non-flat environments without real-world fine-tuning.

| **[STAPO: Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning for LLMs by Silencing Rare Spurious Tokens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15620v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning (RL) has significantly improved large language model reasoning, but existing RL fine-tuning methods rely heavily on heuristic techniques such as entropy regularization and reweighting to maintain stability. In practice, they often suffer from late-stage performance collapse, leading to degraded reasoning quality and unstable training. Our analysis shows that the magnitude of token-wise policy gradients in RL is negatively correlated with token probability and local policy entropy. We find that training instability can be caused by a tiny fraction of tokens, approximately 0.01\%, which we term \emph{spurious tokens}. When such tokens appear in correct responses, they contribute little to the reasoning outcome but inherit the full sequence-level reward, leading to abnormally amplified gradient updates. To mitigate this instability, we design S2T (silencing spurious tokens) mechanism to efficiently identify spurious tokens through characteristic signals with low probability, low entropy, and positive advantage, and then to suppress their gradient perturbations during optimization. Incorporating this mechanism into a group-based objective, we propose Spurious-Token-Aware Policy Optimization (STAPO), which promotes stable and effective large-scale model refinement. Across six mathematical reasoning benchmarks using Qwen 1.7B, 8B, and 14B base models, STAPO consistently demonstrates superior entropy stability and achieves an average performance improvement of 7.13\% ($ρ_{\mathrm{T}}$=1.0, top-p=1.0) and 3.69\% ($ρ_{\mathrm{T}}$=0.7, top-p=0.9) over GRPO, 20-Entropy and JustRL.</p></details> |  |

However, existing AFE methods rely on statistical heuristics, yielding brittle features that fail under distribution shift. We introduce CAFE, a framework that reformulates AFE as a causally-guided sequential decision process, bridging causal discovery with reinforcement learning-driven feature construction. Phase I learns a sparse directed acyclic graph over features and the target to obtain soft causal priors, grouping features as direct, indirect, or other based on their causal influence with respect to the target. Phase II uses a cascading multi-agent deep Q-learning architecture to select causal groups and transformation operators, with hierarchical reward shaping and causal group-level exploration strategies that favor causally plausible transformations while controlling feature complexity. Across 15 public benchmarks (classification with macro-F1; regression with inverse relative absolute error), CAFE achieves up to 7% improvement over strong AFE baselines, reduces episodes-to-convergence, and delivers competitive time-to-target. Under controlled covariate shifts, CAFE reduces performance drop by ~4x relative to a non-causal multi-agent baseline, and produces more compact feature sets with more stable post-hoc attributions. These findings underscore that causal structure, used as a soft inductive prior rather than a rigid constraint, can substantially improve the robustness and efficiency of automated feature engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 Pa...</summary><p>11 Pages, References and Appendix</p></details> |

However, existing DFS methods require models specifically designed for the sequential acquisition setting, limiting compatibility with models already deployed in practice. Furthermore, they provide limited uncertainty quantification, undermining trust in high-stakes decisions. In this work, we show that DFS introduces new uncertainty sources compared to the static setting. We formalise how model adaptation to feature subsets induces epistemic uncertainty, how standard imputation strategies bias aleatoric uncertainty estimation, and why predictive confidence fails to discriminate between good and bad selection policies. We also propose a model-agnostic DFS framework compatible with pre-trained classifiers, including interpretable-by-design models, through efficient subset reparametrization strategies. Empirical evaluation on tabular and image datasets demonstrates competitive accuracy against state-of-the-art greedy and reinforcement learning-based DFS methods with both neural and rule-based classifiers. We further show that the identified uncertainty sources persist across most existing approaches, highlighting the need for uncertainty-aware DFS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach to QoSAware Load Balancing in 5G Cellular Networks under User Mobility and Observation Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24869v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient mobility management and load balancing are critical to sustaining Quality of Service (QoS) in dense, highly dynamic 5G radio access networks. We present a deep reinforcement learning framework based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) for autonomous, QoS-aware load balancing implemented end-to-end in a lightweight, pure-Python simulation environment. The control problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process in which the agent periodically adjusts Cell Individual Offset (CIO) values to steer user-cell associations. A multi-objective reward captures key performance indicators (aggregate throughput, latency, jitter, packet loss rate, Jain's fairness index, and handover count), so the learned policy explicitly balances efficiency and stability under user mobility and noisy observations. The PPO agent uses an actor-critic neural network trained from trajectories generated by the Python simulator with configurable mobility (e.g., Gauss-Markov) and stochastic measurement noise. Across 500+ training episodes and stress tests with increasing user density, the PPO policy consistently improves KPI trends (higher throughput and fairness, lower delay, jitter, packet loss, and handovers) and exhibits rapid, stable convergence. Comparative evaluations show that PPO outperforms rule-based ReBuHa and A3 as well as the learning-based CDQL baseline across all KPIs while maintaining smoother learning dynamics and stronger generalization as load increases. These results indicate that PPO's clipped policy updates and advantage-based training yield robust, deployable control for next-generation RAN load balancing using an entirely Python-based toolchain.</p></details> |  |

While ensuring safe and high-performance inter-robot collaboration is critical for effective task execution, it is difficult to pursue in narrow environments where the feasible region is extremely limited. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach for dual-quadruped collaborative transportation via safe reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, we model the task as a fully cooperative constrained Markov game, where collision avoidance is formulated as constraints. We introduce a cost-advantage decomposition method that enforces the sum of team constraints to remain below an upper bound, thereby guaranteeing task safety within an RL framework. Furthermore, we propose a constraint allocation method that assigns shared constraints to individual robots to maximize the overall task reward, encouraging autonomous task-assignment among robots, thereby improving collaborative task performance. Simulation and real-time experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior performance and a higher success rate in dual-quadruped collaborative transportation compared to existing methods.</p></details> |  |

We formalize the concept of local permutation subgroup actions on windows of biological data, proving that under such actions, the attention mechanism naturally decomposes into a direct sum of orthogonal irreducible components. Critically, these components are intrinsically aligned with the irreducible representations of the acting permutation subgroup, thereby providing a powerful mathematical basis for disentangling symmetric and asymmetric features. We show that PSEAD offers substantial advantages. These include enhanced generalization capabilities to novel biological motifs exhibiting similar partial symmetries, unprecedented interpretability by allowing direct visualization and analysis of attention contributions from different symmetry channels, and significant computational efficiency gains by focusing representational capacity on relevant symmetric subspaces. Beyond static data analysis, we extend PSEAD's applicability to dynamic biological processes within reinforcement learning paradigms, showcasing its potential to accelerate the discovery and optimization of biologically meaningful policies in complex environments like protein folding and drug discovery. This work lays the groundwork for a new generation of biologically informed, symmetry-aware artificial intelligence models.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents; and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable models.

| **[Peaceful Anarcho-Accelerationism: Decentralized Full Automation for a Society of Universal Care](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13154v4)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundational results in machine learning like the universal approximation theorem and deep reinforcement learning convergence and the progressive scale of technology imply that the vast majority of instrumental labor may be progressively automated. Consequently, as this process accelerates, the critical question becomes one of governance: who controls the machines, hence the labor and capital, and toward what ends? Predicting a post-capitalism future, this paper introduces an alternative system for society: anarcho-accelerationism. Concretely, it is a sociotechnical framework in which full automation is decentralized, commons-governed, and oriented toward universal care. To make it happen, I propose the Liberation Stack, a layered architecture of energy, manufacturing, food, communication, knowledge, and governance commons, powered by frontier clean energy technologies within an accelerationist ecologism that achieves sustainability through abundance rather than degrowth. As safety net, this system introduces Universal Desired Resources (UDR) as a post-monetary design principle and show that UDR constitutes the most comprehensive intersectional intervention yet proposed: by eliminating the material basis of oppression, it dissolves all axes of structural inequality simultaneously. Drawing on Maslow's hierarchy, I show that the Liberation Stack satisfies basic needs universally, enabling what the accelerationis literature terms synthetic liberty, the positive freedom that emerges when commons infrastructure provides the material conditions for genuine autonomy. Finally, given a set of assumptions and constraints, I propose a progressive transition from Universal Basic Income to UDR with a phased roadmap and present empirical evidence from Linux, Wikipedia, Mondragon and Rojava confirming that commons-based systems operate at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Reinforcement Learning: Fast and Scalable Quantum Circuit Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15146v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum unitary synthesis addresses the problem of translating abstract quantum algorithms into sequences of hardware-executable quantum gates. Solving this task exactly is infeasible in general due to the exponential growth of the underlying combinatorial search space. Existing approaches suffer from misaligned optimization objectives, substantial training costs and limited generalization across different qubit counts. We mitigate these limitations by using supervised learning to approximate the minimum description length of residual unitaries and combining this estimate with stochastic beam search to identify near optimal gate sequences. Our method relies on a lightweight model with zero-shot generalization, substantially reducing training overhead compared to prior baselines. Across multiple benchmarks, we achieve faster wall-clock synthesis times while exceeding state-of-the-art methods in terms of success rate for complex circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16301v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between "learning-aware" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between "naive learners" updating on fast timescales and "meta-learners" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.</p></details> | 26 pages, 4 figures |

A critical component of their training is the incorporation of reference-based reward systems within reinforcement learning (RL), where model outputs are evaluated against ground truth references. However, existing reward benchmarks focus on preference comparisons between responses rather than evaluating verification against ground truth references, leaving a critical gap in our ability to evaluate verification systems used in reasoning model training. In this paper, we introduce VerifyBench and its challenging variant VerifyBench-Hard, two benchmarks specifically designed to assess reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks are constructed through meticulous data collection and curation, followed by careful human annotation to ensure high quality. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that while larger model-based verifiers show promise on standard cases, all current systems demonstrate substantial room for improvement on challenging instances. Through systematic analysis of performance patterns across reasoning tasks and error categories, we provide insights for advancing reference-based reward systems. These benchmarks establish a standardized framework for improving verification accuracy, ultimately enhancing reasoning capabilities in models trained via RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026: https://openreview.net/forum?id=JfsjGmuFxz Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/VerifyBench Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/ZJU-REAL/VerifyBench Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/VerifyBench</p></details> |
| **[MedReasoner: Reinforcement Learning Drives Reasoning Grounding from Clinical Thought to Pixel-Level Precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08177v3)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately grounding regions of interest (ROIs) is critical for diagnosis and treatment planning in medical imaging. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) combine visual perception with natural language, current medical-grounding pipelines still rely on supervised fine-tuning with explicit spatial hints, making them ill-equipped to handle the implicit queries common in clinical practice. This work makes three core contributions. We first define Unified Medical Reasoning Grounding (UMRG), a novel vision-language task that demands clinical reasoning and pixel-level grounding. Second, we release U-MRG-14K, a dataset of 14K samples featuring pixel-level masks alongside implicit clinical queries and reasoning traces, spanning 10 modalities, 15 super-categories, and 108 specific categories. Finally, we introduce MedReasoner, a modular framework that distinctly separates reasoning from segmentation: an MLLM reasoner is optimized with reinforcement learning, while a frozen segmentation expert converts spatial prompts into masks, with alignment achieved through format and accuracy rewards. MedReasoner achieves state-of-the-art performance on U-MRG-14K and demonstrates strong generalization to unseen clinical queries, underscoring the significant promise of reinforcement learning for interpretable medical grounding.</p></details> | AAAI2026 |
| **[Features as Rewards: Scalable Supervision for Open-Ended Tasks via Interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10067v3)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models trained on large-scale datasets have been shown to learn features that encode abstract concepts such as factuality or intent. Such features are traditionally used for test-time monitoring or steering. We present an alternative affordance: features as scalable supervision for open-ended tasks. We consider the case of hallucination-reduction as a desirable, yet open-ended behavior and design a reinforcement learning (RL) pipeline, titled RLFR (Reinforcement Learning from Feature Rewards), that uses features as reward functions. Grounded in a novel probing framework that identifies candidate hallucinated claims, our pipeline teaches a model to intervene and correct its completions when it is uncertain of their factuality. Furthermore, the pipeline enables scalable test-time compute, guided once more by our reward features. This end-to-end process operationalized on Gemma-3-12B-IT results in a policy that is 58% less likely to hallucinate compared to the original model (when run in tandem with our probing harness), while preserving performance on standard benchmarks. Taken together, by grounding supervision in the language of features, this paper introduces a novel paradigm in the use of interpretability for learning open-ended tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[CaveAgent: Transforming LLMs into Stateful Runtime Operators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01569v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are increasingly capable of complex task execution, yet current agentic systems remain constrained by text-centric paradigms that struggle with long-horizon tasks due to fragile multi-turn dependencies and context drift. We present CaveAgent, a framework that shifts tool use from ``LLM-as-Text-Generator'' to ``LLM-as-Runtime-Operator.'' CaveAgent introduces a dual-stream architecture that inverts the conventional paradigm: rather than treating the LLM's text context as the primary workspace with tools as auxiliary, CaveAgent elevates the persistent Python runtime as the central locus of state, with a lightweight semantic stream serving as its orchestrator. Beyond leveraging code generation to resolve interdependent sub-tasks (e.g., loops, conditionals) in a single step, CaveAgent introduces \textit{Stateful Runtime Management}: it injects, manipulates, and retrieves complex Python objects (e.g., DataFrames, database connections) that persist across turns, unlike existing code-based approaches that remain text-bound. CaveAgent further provides a runtime-integrated skill management system that extends the Agent Skills open standard, enabling ecosystem interoperability through executable skill injections. This persistence mechanism serves as a high-fidelity external memory that reduces context drift in multi-turn interactions and preserves processed data for downstream applications without information loss. Evaluations show consistent improvement across challenging benchmarks, enabling CaveAgent to handle data scales that cause context overflow in both JSON-based and code-based agents. The accessible runtime state further provides programmatically verifiable feedback, enabling automated evaluation and reward signal generation without human annotation and establishing a structural foundation for future research in Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR).</p></details> | version 2 |
| **[Graphon Mean-Field Subsampling for Cooperative Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16196v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coordinating large populations of interacting agents is a central challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), where the size of the joint state-action space scales exponentially with the number of agents. Mean-field methods alleviate this burden by aggregating agent interactions, but these approaches assume homogeneous interactions. Recent graphon-based frameworks capture heterogeneity, but are computationally expensive as the number of agents grows. Therefore, we introduce $\texttt{GMFS}$, a $\textbf{G}$raphon $\textbf{M}$ean-$\textbf{F}$ield $\textbf{S}$ubsampling framework for scalable cooperative MARL with heterogeneous agent interactions. By subsampling $κ$ agents according to interaction strength, we approximate the graphon-weighted mean-field and learn a policy with sample complexity $\mathrm{poly}(κ)$ and optimality gap $O(1/\sqrtκ)$. We verify our theory with numerical simulations in robotic coordination, showing that $\texttt{GMFS}$ achieves near-optimal performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 5 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $τ^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Transformer-based architectures often demonstrate superior global contextual modeling but at the expense of excessive parameter counts and memory demands, restricting their clinical deployment. We propose RefineFormer3D, a lightweight hierarchical transformer architecture that balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency for volumetric medical imaging. The architecture integrates three key components: (i) GhostConv3D-based patch embedding for efficient feature extraction with minimal redundancy, (ii) MixFFN3D module with low-rank projections and depthwise convolutions for parameter-efficient feature extraction, and (iii) a cross-attention fusion decoder enabling adaptive multi-scale skip connection integration. RefineFormer3D contains only 2.94M parameters, substantially fewer than contemporary transformer-based methods. Extensive experiments on ACDC and BraTS benchmarks demonstrate that RefineFormer3D achieves 93.44\% and 85.9\% average Dice scores respectively, outperforming or matching state-of-the-art methods while requiring significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore, the model achieves fast inference (8.35 ms per volume on GPU) with low memory requirements, supporting deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. These results establish RefineFormer3D as an effective and scalable solution for practical 3D medical image segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[A Review of Bayesian Uncertainty Quantification in Deep Probabilistic Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16370v8)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in architectural design, data availability, and compute have driven remarkable progress in semantic segmentation. Yet, these models often rely on relaxed Bayesian assumptions, omitting critical uncertainty information needed for robust decision-making. Despite growing interest in probabilistic segmentation to address point-estimate limitations, the research landscape remains fragmented. In response, this review synthesizes foundational concepts in uncertainty modeling, analyzing how feature- and parameter-distribution modeling impact four key segmentation tasks: Observer Variability, Active Learning, Model Introspection, and Model Generalization. Our work establishes a common framework by standardizing theory, notation, and terminology, thereby bridging the gap between method developers, task specialists, and applied researchers. We then discuss critical challenges, including the nuanced distinction between uncertainty types, strong assumptions in spatial aggregation, the lack of standardized benchmarks, and pitfalls in current quantification methods. We identify promising avenues for future research, such as uncertainty-aware active learning, data-driven benchmarks, transformer-based models, and novel techniques to move from simple segmentation problems to uncertainty in holistic scene understanding. Based on our analysis, we offer practical guidelines for researchers on method selection, evaluation, reproducibility, and meaningful uncertainty estimation. Ultimately, our goal is to facilitate the development of more reliable, efficient, and interpretable segmentation models that can be confidently deployed in real-world applications.</p></details> | TMLR |
| **[Activation-Space Uncertainty Quantification for Pretrained Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14934v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable uncertainty estimates are crucial for deploying pretrained models; yet, many strong methods for quantifying uncertainty require retraining, Monte Carlo sampling, or expensive second-order computations and may alter a frozen backbone's predictions. To address this, we introduce Gaussian Process Activations (GAPA), a post-hoc method that shifts Bayesian modeling from weights to activations. GAPA replaces standard nonlinearities with Gaussian-process activations whose posterior mean exactly matches the original activation, preserving the backbone's point predictions by construction while providing closed-form epistemic variances in activation space. To scale to modern architectures, we use a sparse variational inducing-point approximation over cached training activations, combined with local k-nearest-neighbor subset conditioning, enabling deterministic single-pass uncertainty propagation without sampling, backpropagation, or second-order information. Across regression, classification, image segmentation, and language modeling, GAPA matches or outperforms strong post-hoc baselines in calibration and out-of-distribution detection while remaining efficient at test time.</p></details> |  |

Current deep learning approaches primarily focus on encoder-decoder architectural refinements. However, existing methodologies exhibit several limitations:(1)they rely on dilated convolutions for multi-scale context extraction, lacking the partial feature effectiveness and interoperability of inter-channel;(2)attention-based feature enhancement implementations neglect accuracy-throughput balance; and (3)the decoder modifications fail to establish global interdependencies among hierarchical local features, limiting inference efficiency. To address these challenges, we propose MPCM-Net, a Multi-scale network that integrates Partial attention Convolutions with Mamba architectures to enhance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. Specifically, the encoder incorporates MPAC, which comprises:(1)a MPC block with ParCM and ParSM that enables global spatial interaction across multi-scale cloud formations, and (2)a MPA block combining ParAM and ParSM to extract discriminative features with reduced computational complexity. On the decoder side, a M2B is employed to mitigate contextual loss through a SSHD that maintains linear complexity while enabling deep feature aggregation across spatial and scale dimensions. As a key contribution to the community, we also introduce and release a dataset CSRC, which is a clear-label, fine-grained segmentation benchmark designed to overcome the critical limitations of existing public datasets. Extensive experiments on CSRC demonstrate the superior performance of MPCM-Net over state-of-the-art methods, achieving an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and inference speed. The dataset and source code will be available at https://github.com/she1110/CSRC.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mitigating Pretraining-Induced Attention Asymmetry in 2D+ Electron Microscopy Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14105v3)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision models pretrained on large-scale RGB natural image datasets are widely reused for electron microscopy image segmentation. In electron microscopy, volumetric data are acquired as serial sections and processed as stacks of adjacent grayscale slices, where neighboring slices provide symmetric contextual information for identifying features on the central slice. The common strategy maps such stacks to pseudo-RGB inputs to enable transfer learning from pretrained models. However, this mapping imposes channel-specific semantics inherited from natural images, even though electron microscopy slices are homogeneous in the modality and symmetric in their predictive roles. As a result, pretrained models may encode inductive biases that are misaligned with the inherent symmetry of volumetric electron microscopy data. In this work, it is demonstrated that RGB-pretrained models systematically assign unequal importance to individual input slices when applied to stacked electron microscopy data, despite the absence of any intrinsic channel ordering. Using saliency-based attribution analysis across multiple architectures, a consistent channel-level asymmetry was observed that persists after fine-tuning and affects model interpretability, even when segmentation performance is unchanged. To address this issue, a targeted modification of pretraining weights based on uniform channel initialization was proposed, which restores symmetric feature attribution while preserving the benefits of pretraining. Experiments on the SNEMI, Lucchi and GF-PA66 datasets confirm a substantial reduction in attribution bias without compromising or even improving segmentation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[VIPA: Visual Informative Part Attention for Referring Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14788v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) aims to segment a target object described by a natural language expression. Existing methods have evolved by leveraging the vision information into the language tokens. To more effectively exploit visual contexts for fine-grained segmentation, we propose a novel Visual Informative Part Attention (VIPA) framework for referring image segmentation. VIPA leverages the informative parts of visual contexts, called a visual expression, which can effectively provide the structural and semantic visual target information to the network. This design reduces high-variance cross-modal projection and enhances semantic consistency in an attention mechanism of the referring image segmentation. We also design a visual expression generator (VEG) module, which retrieves informative visual tokens via local-global linguistic context cues and refines the retrieved tokens for reducing noise information and sharing informative visual attributes. This module allows the visual expression to consider comprehensive contexts and capture semantic visual contexts of informative regions. In this way, our framework enables the network's attention to robustly align with the fine-grained regions of interest. Extensive experiments and visual analysis demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our VIPA outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods on four public RIS benchmarks.</p></details> | Preprint |

Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission of redundant or low-value data. To this end, we introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL) framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively increases data difficulty during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for real-world HSI applications.

| **[Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation on Low Quality Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14042v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In real-world scenarios, the performance of semantic segmentation often deteriorates when processing low-quality (LQ) images, which may lack clear semantic structures and high-frequency details. Although image restoration techniques offer a promising direction for enhancing degraded visual content, conventional real-world image restoration (Real-IR) models primarily focus on pixel-level fidelity and often fail to recover task-relevant semantic cues, limiting their effectiveness when directly applied to downstream vision tasks. Conversely, existing segmentation models trained on high-quality data lack robustness under real-world degradations. In this paper, we propose Restoration Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (RASS), which effectively integrates semantic image restoration into the segmentation process, enabling high-quality semantic segmentation on the LQ images directly. Specifically, we first propose a Semantic-Constrained Restoration (SCR) model, which injects segmentation priors into the restoration model by aligning its cross-attention maps with segmentation masks, encouraging semantically faithful image reconstruction. Then, RASS transfers semantic restoration knowledge into segmentation through LoRA-based module merging and task-specific fine-tuning, thereby enhancing the model's robustness to LQ images. To validate the effectiveness of our framework, we construct a real-world LQ image segmentation dataset with high-quality annotations, and conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world LQ benchmarks. The results show that SCR and RASS significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods in segmentation and restoration tasks. Code, models, and datasets will be available at https://github.com/Ka1Guan/RASS.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Certainty Equivalent Risk-Controlling Prediction Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13660v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In safety-critical applications such as medical image segmentation, prediction systems must provide reliability guarantees that extend beyond conventional expected loss control. While risk-controlling prediction sets (RCPS) offer probabilistic guarantees on the expected risk, they fail to capture tail behavior and worst-case scenarios that are crucial in high-stakes settings. This paper introduces optimized certainty equivalent RCPS (OCE-RCPS), a novel framework that provides high-probability guarantees on general optimized certainty equivalent (OCE) risk measures, including conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) and entropic risk. OCE-RCPS leverages upper confidence bounds to identify prediction set parameters that satisfy user-specified risk tolerance levels with provable reliability. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that OCE-RCPS satisfies the desired probabilistic constraint for loss functions such as miscoverage and false negative rate. Experiments on image segmentation demonstrate that OCE-RCPS consistently meets target satisfaction rates across various risk measures and reliability configurations, while OCE-CRC fails to provide probabilistic guarantees.</p></details> | Sumitted to EUSIPCO |

Prior work on referring image grounding focuses on categorical and spatial queries (e.g., "left-most apple") and overlooks functional and physical reasoning (e.g., "where can I safely store the knife?"). We address this gap and introduce Conversational Image Segmentation (CIS) and ConverSeg, a benchmark spanning entities, spatial relations, intent, affordances, functions, safety, and physical reasoning. We also present ConverSeg-Net, which fuses strong segmentation priors with language understanding, and an AI-powered data engine that generates prompt-mask pairs without human supervision.

| **[DynaGuide: A Generalizable Dynamic Guidance Framework for Unsupervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13020v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised image segmentation is a critical task in computer vision. It enables dense scene understanding without human annotations, which is especially valuable in domains where labelled data is scarce. However, existing methods often struggle to reconcile global semantic structure with fine-grained boundary accuracy. This paper introduces DynaGuide, an adaptive segmentation framework that addresses these challenges through a novel dual-guidance strategy and dynamic loss optimization. Building on our previous work, DynaSeg, DynaGuide combines global pseudo-labels from zero-shot models such as DiffSeg or SegFormer with local boundary refinement using a lightweight CNN trained from scratch. This synergy allows the model to correct coarse or noisy global predictions and produce high-precision segmentations. At the heart of DynaGuide is a multi-component loss that dynamically balances feature similarity, Huber-smoothed spatial continuity, including diagonal relationships, and semantic alignment with the global pseudo-labels. Unlike prior approaches, DynaGuide trains entirely without ground-truth labels in the target domain and supports plug-and-play integration of diverse guidance sources. Extensive experiments on BSD500, PASCAL VOC2012, and COCO demonstrate that DynaGuide achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving mIoU by 17.5% on BSD500, 3.1% on PASCAL VOC2012, and 11.66% on COCO. With its modular design, strong generalization, and minimal computational footprint, DynaGuide offers a scalable and practical solution for unsupervised segmentation in real-world settings.

Despite existing applications of deep learning in land use monitoring, standard convolutional kernels in deep neural networks limit the applications of these networks to the Euclidean domain only. Considering the geodesic nature of the measurement of the earth's surface, remote sensing is one such area that can benefit from non-Euclidean and spherical domains. For this purpose, we designed a novel Graph Neural Network architecture for spatial and spatio-temporal classification using satellite imagery to acquire insights into socio-economic indicators. We propose a hybrid attention method to learn the relative importance of irregular neighbors in remote sensing data. Instead of classifying each pixel, we propose a method based on Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) image segmentation and Graph Attention Network. The superpixels obtained from SLIC become the nodes of our Graph Convolution Network (GCN). A region adjacency graph (RAG) is then constructed where each superpixel is connected to every other adjacent superpixel in the image, enabling information to propagate globally. Finally, we propose a Spatially driven Attention Graph Neural Network (SAG-NN) to classify each RAG. We also propose an extension to our SAG-NN for spatio-temporal data. Unlike regular grids of pixels in images, superpixels are irregular in nature and cannot be used to create spatio-temporal graphs. We introduce temporal bias by combining unconnected RAGs from each image into one supergraph. This is achieved by introducing block adjacency matrices resulting in novel Spatio-Temporal driven Attention Graph Neural Network with Block Adjacency matrix (STAG-NN-BA). SAG-NN and STAG-NN-BA outperform graph and non-graph baselines on Asia14 and C2D2 datasets efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Harmonizing Generalization and Specialization: Uncertainty-Informed Collaborative Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13101v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision foundation models have demonstrated strong generalization in medical image segmentation by leveraging large-scale, heterogeneous pretraining. However, they often struggle to generalize to specialized clinical tasks under limited annotations or rare pathological variations, due to a mismatch between general priors and task-specific requirements. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-informed Collaborative Learning (UnCoL), a dual-teacher framework that harmonizes generalization and specialization in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Specifically, UnCoL distills both visual and semantic representations from a frozen foundation model to transfer general knowledge, while concurrently maintaining a progressively adapting teacher to capture fine-grained and task-specific representations. To balance guidance from both teachers, pseudo-label learning in UnCoL is adaptively regulated by predictive uncertainty, which selectively suppresses unreliable supervision and stabilizes learning in ambiguous regions. Experiments on diverse 2D and 3D segmentation benchmarks show that UnCoL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised methods and foundation model baselines. Moreover, our model delivers near fully supervised performance with markedly reduced annotation requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging (TMI), 2026</p></details> |
| **[PLESS: Pseudo-Label Enhancement with Spreading Scribbles for Weakly Supervised Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11628v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly supervised learning with scribble annotations uses sparse user-drawn strokes to indicate segmentation labels on a small subset of pixels. This annotation reduces the cost of dense pixel-wise labeling, but suffers inherently from noisy and incomplete supervision. Recent scribble-based approaches in medical image segmentation address this limitation using pseudo-label-based training; however, the quality of the pseudo-labels remains a key performance limit. We propose PLESS, a generic pseudo-label enhancement strategy which improves reliability and spatial consistency. It builds on a hierarchical partitioning of the image into a hierarchy of spatially coherent regions. PLESS propagates scribble information to refine pseudo-labels within semantically coherent regions. The framework is model-agnostic and easily integrates into existing pseudo-label methods. Experiments on two public cardiac MRI datasets (ACDC and MSCMRseg) across four scribble-supervised algorithms show consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy. Code will be made available on GitHub upon acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work was supported by the Afeyan Family Foundation Seed Grants and the JACE Foundation Research Innovation Grant Program at AUA</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging Unlabeled Scans for NCCT Image Segmentation in Early Stroke Diagnosis: A Semi-Supervised GAN Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19576v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ischemic stroke is a time-critical medical emergency where rapid diagnosis is essential for improving patient outcomes. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) serves as the frontline imaging tool, yet it often fails to reveal the subtle ischemic changes present in the early, hyperacute phase. This limitation can delay crucial interventions. To address this diagnostic challenge, we introduce a semi-supervised segmentation method using generative adversarial networks (GANs) to accurately delineate early ischemic stroke regions. The proposed method employs an adversarial framework to effectively learn from a limited number of annotated NCCT scans, while simultaneously leveraging a larger pool of unlabeled scans. By employing Dice loss, cross-entropy loss, a feature matching loss and a self-training loss, the model learns to identify and delineate early infarcts, even when they are faint or their size is small. Experiments on the publicly available Acute Ischemic Stroke Dataset (AISD) demonstrate the potential of the proposed method to enhance diagnostic capabilities, reduce the burden of manual annotation, and support more efficient clinical decision-making in stroke care.</p></details> |  |
| **[CT Synthesis with Conditional Diffusion Models for Abdominal Lymph Node Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17770v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the significant success achieved by deep learning methods in medical image segmentation, researchers still struggle in the computer-aided diagnosis of abdominal lymph nodes due to the complex abdominal environment, small and indistinguishable lesions, and limited annotated data. To address these problems, we present a pipeline that integrates the conditional diffusion model for lymph node generation and the nnU-Net model for lymph node segmentation to improve the segmentation performance of abdominal lymph nodes through synthesizing a diversity of realistic abdominal lymph node data. We propose LN-DDPM, a conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) for lymph node (LN) generation. LN-DDPM utilizes lymph node masks and anatomical structure masks as model conditions. These conditions work in two conditioning mechanisms: global structure conditioning and local detail conditioning, to distinguish between lymph nodes and their surroundings and better capture lymph node characteristics. The obtained paired abdominal lymph node images and masks are used for the downstream segmentation task. Experimental results on the abdominal lymph node datasets demonstrate that LN-DDPM outperforms other generative methods in the abdominal lymph node image synthesis and better assists the downstream abdominal lymph node segmentation task.</p></details> |  |

In addition, there are significant risks to the subsequent process of in-space repairs through human extravehicular activity or robotic manipulation, incurring substantial operational costs. Recent developments in image segmentation could enable the development of reliable and cost-effective autonomous inspection systems. While these models often require large amounts of training data to achieve satisfactory results, publicly available annotated spacecraft segmentation data are very scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of nearly 64k annotated spacecraft images that was created using real spacecraft models, superimposed on a mixture of real and synthetic backgrounds generated using NASA's TTALOS pipeline. To mimic camera distortions and noise in real-world image acquisition, we also added different types of noise and distortion to the images. Our dataset includes images with several real-world challenges, including noise, camera distortions, glare, varying lighting conditions, varying field of view, partial spacecraft visibility, brightly-lit city backgrounds, densely patterned and confounding backgrounds, aurora borealis, and a wide variety of spacecraft geometries. Finally, we finetuned YOLOv8 and YOLOv11 models for spacecraft segmentation to generate performance benchmarks for the dataset under well-defined hardware and inference time constraints to mimic real-world image segmentation challenges for real-time onboard applications in space on NASA's inspector spacecraft. The resulting models, when tested under these constraints, achieved a Dice score of 0.92, Hausdorff distance of 0.69, and an inference time of about 0.5 second. The dataset and models for performance benchmark are available at https://github.com/RiceD2KLab/SWiM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM): Instance Deformation for Image Manipulation and Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07295v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In medical imaging, the diffusion models have shown great potential for synthetic image generation tasks. However, these approaches often lack the interpretable connections between the generated and real images and can create anatomically implausible structures or illusions. To address these limitations, we propose the Deformation-Recovery Diffusion Model (DRDM), a novel diffusion-based generative model that emphasises morphological transformation through deformation fields rather than direct image synthesis. DRDM introduces a topology-preserving deformation field generation strategy, which randomly samples and integrates multi-scale Deformation Velocity Fields (DVFs). DRDM is trained to learn to recover unrealistic deformation components, thus restoring randomly deformed images to a realistic distribution. This formulation enables the generation of diverse yet anatomically plausible deformations that preserve structural integrity, thereby improving data augmentation and synthesis for downstream tasks such as few-shot learning and image registration. Experiments on cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging and pulmonary Computed Tomography show that DRDM is capable of creating diverse, large-scale deformations, while maintaining anatomical plausibility of deformation fields. Additional evaluations on 2D image segmentation and 3D image registration tasks indicate notable performance gains, underscoring DRDM's potential to enhance both image manipulation and generative modelling in medical imaging applications.

The airway tree modeling on CT images can provide the experts with 3-dimension measurements like wall thickness, etc. This information can tremendously aid the diagnosis of pulmonary diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [1-4]. Many scholars have attempted various ways to model the lung airway tree, which can be split into two major categories based on its nature. Namely, the model-based approach and the deep learning approach. The performance of a typical model-based approach usually depends on the manual tuning of the model parameter, which can be its advantages and disadvantages. The advantage is its don't require a large amount of training data which can be beneficial for a small dataset like medical imaging. On the other hand, the performance of model-based may be a misconcep-tion [5,6]. In recent years, deep learning has achieved good results in the field of medical image processing, and many scholars have used UNet-based methods in medical image segmentation [7-11]. Among all the variation of UNet, the UNet 3+ [11] have relatively good result compare to the rest of the variation of UNet. Therefor to further improve the accuracy of lung airway tree modeling, this study combines the Frangi filter [5] with UNet 3+ [11] to develop a dual-channel 3D UNet 3+. The Frangi filter is used to extracting vessel-like feature. The vessel-like feature then used as input to guide the dual-channel UNet 3+ training and testing procedures.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors have decided to withdraw this manuscript in order to substantially revise the methodology and experimental design.

| **[Med-SegLens: Latent-Level Model Diffing for Interpretable Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10508v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern segmentation models achieve strong predictive performance but remain largely opaque, limiting our ability to diagnose failures, understand dataset shift, or intervene in a principled manner. We introduce Med-SegLens, a model-diffing framework that decomposes segmentation model activations into interpretable latent features using sparse autoencoders trained on SegFormer and U-Net. Through cross-architecture and cross-dataset latent alignment across healthy, adult, pediatric, and sub-Saharan African glioma cohorts, we identify a stable backbone of shared representations, while dataset shift is driven by differential reliance on population-specific latents. We show that these latents act as causal bottlenecks for segmentation failures, and that targeted latent-level interventions can correct errors and improve cross-dataset adaption without retraining, recovering performance in 70% of failure cases and improving Dice score from 39.4% to 74.2%. Our results demonstrate that latent-level model diffing provides a practical and mechanistic tool for diagnosing failures and mitigating dataset shift in segmentation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[GenSeg-R1: RL-Driven Vision-Language Grounding for Fine-Grained Referring Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09701v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study fine-grained referring image segmentation via a decoupled reason-then-segment pipeline. A vision-language model (VLM) receives an image and a natural-language query, reasons about the scene, and emits structured spatial prompts: a bounding box plus two interior keypoints for every referred instance. A frozen promptable segmenter (SAM 2) converts these prompts into high-quality masks. Within our GenSeg-R1 framework we finetune Qwen3-VL models (4B and 8B parameters) using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), requiring no supervised reasoning-chain annotations. On RefCOCOg validation our best model (GenSeg-R1-8B) achieves 0.7127 cIoU and 0.7382 mIoU, substantially outperforming the corresponding Qwen3-VL Instruct baselines (+15.3 and +21.9 points, respectively) and surpassing Seg-Zero-7B [3] by +3.3 cIoU under identical evaluation. We further introduce GenSeg-R1-G, a variant trained on GRefCOCO [9] with a SAM 2 in-the-loop reward that directly optimizes mask quality. On GRefCOCO validation GenSeg-R1-G achieves 76.69% target mIoU with 82.40% accuracy on negative (no-target) prompts, substantially outperforming Seg-R1-7B and Seg-Zero-7B, which lack no-target detection capability. On ReasonSeg test, GenSeg-R1-4B reaches 68.40% mIoU, surpassing Seg-Zero-7B by +7.0 and Seg-R1-7B by +10.7 points.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semi-supervised Liver Segmentation and Patch-based Fibrosis Staging with Registration-aided Multi-parametric MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09686v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Liver fibrosis poses a substantial challenge in clinical practice, emphasizing the necessity for precise liver segmentation and accurate disease staging. Based on the CARE Liver 2025 Track 4 Challenge, this study introduces a multi-task deep learning framework developed for liver segmentation (LiSeg) and liver fibrosis staging (LiFS) using multiparametric MRI. The LiSeg phase addresses the challenge of limited annotated images and the complexities of multi-parametric MRI data by employing a semi-supervised learning model that integrates image segmentation and registration. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, the model overcomes the difficulties introduced by domain shifts and variations across modalities. In the LiFS phase, we employed a patchbased method which allows the visualization of liver fibrosis stages based on the classification outputs. Our approach effectively handles multimodality imaging data, limited labels, and domain shifts. The proposed method has been tested by the challenge organizer on an independent test set that includes in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) cases using three-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI) and seven-channel MRIs (T1, T2, DWI, GED1-GED4).

| **[MediRound: Multi-Round Entity-Level Reasoning Segmentation in Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12110v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the progress in medical image segmentation, most existing methods remain task-specific and lack interactivity. Although recent text-prompt-based segmentation approaches enhance user-driven and reasoning-based segmentation, they remain confined to single-round dialogues and fail to perform multi-round reasoning. In this work, we introduce Multi-Round Entity-Level Medical Reasoning Segmentation (MEMR-Seg), a new task that requires generating segmentation masks through multi-round queries with entity-level reasoning. To support this task, we construct MR-MedSeg, a large-scale dataset of 177K multi-round medical segmentation dialogues, featuring entity-based reasoning across rounds. Furthermore, we propose MediRound, an effective baseline model designed for multi-round medical reasoning segmentation. To mitigate the inherent error propagation in the chain-like pipeline of multi-round segmentation, we introduce a lightweight yet effective Judgment & Correction Mechanism during model inference. Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively addresses the MEMR-Seg task and outperforms conventional medical referring segmentation methods.</p></details> | 16pages, 10 figures |
| **[Not All Pixels Are Equal: Pixel-wise Meta-Learning for Medical Segmentation with Noisy Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18894v4)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical applications, but it is frequently disrupted by noisy annotations and ambiguous anatomical boundaries, limiting its application in real-world scenarios. Existing methods often directly adapt noisy label learning techniques designed for instance classification, overlooking the pixel-wise heterogeneity in medical segmentation with its spatially and anatomically varying difficulties. Consequently, global assumptions or simple confidence metrics fail to address these local variations, leaving boundary ambiguities unresolved. To address this issue, we propose MetaDCSeg, a robust framework that dynamically learns optimal pixel-wise weights to suppress the influence of noisy labels while preserving reliable annotations. By explicitly modeling boundary uncertainty through a Dynamic Center Distance (DCD) mechanism, our approach utilizes weighted feature distances for foreground, background, and boundary centers, directing the model's attention toward hard-to-segment pixels near ambiguous boundaries. This strategy enables more precise handling of structural boundaries, which are often overlooked by existing methods, and significantly enhances segmentation performance. Extensive experiments across four benchmark datasets with varying noise levels demonstrate that MetaDCSeg outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |

The scarcity of high-quality labeled data remains a major challenge in medical image analysis due to the high annotation costs and the need for specialized clinical expertise. Semi-supervised learning has demonstrated significant potential in addressing this bottleneck, with pseudo-labeling and consistency regularization emerging as two predominant paradigms. Dual-task collaborative learning, an emerging consistency-aware paradigm, seeks to derive supplementary supervision by establishing prediction consistency between related tasks. However, current methodologies are limited to unidirectional interaction mechanisms (typically regression-to-segmentation), as segmentation results can only be transformed into regression outputs in an offline manner, thereby failing to fully exploit the potential benefits of online bidirectional cross-task collaboration. Thus, we propose a fully Differentiable Bidirectional Synergistic Learning (DBiSL) framework, which seamlessly integrates and enhances four critical SSL components: supervised learning, consistency regularization, pseudo-supervised learning, and uncertainty estimation. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate our method's state-of-the-art performance. Beyond technical contributions, this work provides new insights into unified SSL framework design and establishes a new architectural foundation for dual-task-driven SSL, while offering a generic multitask learning framework applicable to broader computer vision applications.

However, existing methods are constrained to predefined categories, produce one-shot predictions without adaptive refinement, and lack mechanisms for clinician interaction. We propose IR-SIS, an iterative refinement system for surgical image segmentation that accepts natural language descriptions. IR-SIS leverages a fine-tuned SAM3 for initial segmentation, employs a Vision-Language Model to detect instruments and assess segmentation quality, and applies an agentic workflow that adaptively selects refinement strategies. The system supports clinician-in-the-loop interaction through natural language feedback. We also construct a multi-granularity language-annotated dataset from EndoVis2017 and EndoVis2018 benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-distribution data, with clinician interaction providing additional improvements. Our work establishes the first language-based surgical segmentation framework with adaptive self-refinement capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are Vision Foundation Models Foundational for Electron Microscopy Image Segmentation?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08505v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although vision foundation models (VFMs) are increasingly reused for biomedical image analysis, it remains unclear whether the latent representations they provide are general enough to support effective transfer and reuse across heterogeneous microscopy image datasets. Here, we study this question for the problem of mitochondria segmentation in electron microscopy (EM) images, using two popular public EM datasets (Lucchi++ and VNC) and three recent representative VFMs (DINOv2, DINOv3, and OpenCLIP). We evaluate two practical model adaptation regimes: a frozen-backbone setting in which only a lightweight segmentation head is trained on top of the VFM, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in which the VFM is fine-tuned in a targeted manner to a specific dataset. Across all backbones, we observe that training on a single EM dataset yields good segmentation performance (quantified as foreground Intersection-over-Union), and that LoRA consistently improves in-domain performance. In contrast, training on multiple EM datasets leads to severe performance degradation for all models considered, with only marginal gains from PEFT. Exploration of the latent representation space through various techniques (PCA, Fréchet Dinov2 distance, and linear probes) reveals a pronounced and persistent domain mismatch between the two considered EM datasets in spite of their visual similarity, which is consistent with the observed failure of paired training. These results suggest that, while VFMs can deliver competitive results for EM segmentation within a single domain under lightweight adaptation, current PEFT strategies are insufficient to obtain a single robust model across heterogeneous EM datasets without additional domain-alignment mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

However, prevailing SSL frameworks are fundamentally "inward-looking", recycling information and biases solely from within the target dataset. This design triggers a vicious cycle of confirmation bias under class imbalance, leading to the catastrophic failure to recognize minority classes. To dismantle this systemic issue, we propose a paradigm shift to a multi-level "outward-looking" framework. Our primary innovation is Foundational Knowledge Distillation (FKD), which looks outward beyond the confines of medical imaging by introducing a pre-trained visual foundation model, DINOv3, as an unbiased external semantic teacher. Instead of trusting the student's biased high confidence, our method distills knowledge from DINOv3's robust understanding of high semantic uniqueness, providing a stable, cross-domain supervisory signal that anchors the learning of minority classes. To complement this core strategy, we further look outward within the data by proposing Progressive Imbalance-aware CutMix (PIC), which creates a dynamic curriculum that adaptively forces the model to focus on minority classes in both labeled and unlabeled subsets. This layered strategy forms our framework, DINO-Mix, which breaks the vicious cycle of bias and achieves remarkable performance on challenging semi-supervised class-imbalanced medical image segmentation benchmarks Synapse and AMOS.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 Workshop on Artificial Intelligence with Biased or Scarce Data (Oral)</p></details> |

Conventional approaches predominantly rely on deep neural networks (DNNs), which incur high energy costs due to extensive analog-to-digital conversions and large-scale image computations required for low-latency, real-time responses. Diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) have shown promising advantages over conventional DNNs on digital or optoelectronic computing platforms in energy efficiency. By performing all-optical image processing via light diffraction at the speed of light, DONNs save computation energy costs while reducing the overhead associated with analog-to-digital conversions by all-optical encoding and computing. In this work, we propose a novel all-optical computing framework for RGB image segmentation and lane detection in autonomous driving applications. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the DONN system for image segmentation on the CityScapes dataset. Additionally, we conduct case studies on lane detection using a customized indoor track dataset and simulated driving scenarios in CARLA, where we further evaluate the model's generalizability under diverse environmental conditions.</p></details> |  |

| **[Benchmarking Adversarial Robustness and Adversarial Training Strategies for Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16494v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection models are critical components of automated systems, such as autonomous vehicles and perception-based robots, but their sensitivity to adversarial attacks poses a serious security risk. Progress in defending these models lags behind classification, hindered by a lack of standardized evaluation. It is nearly impossible to thoroughly compare attack or defense methods, as existing work uses different datasets, inconsistent efficiency metrics, and varied measures of perturbation cost. This paper addresses this gap by investigating three key questions: (1) How can we create a fair benchmark to impartially compare attacks? (2) How well do modern attacks transfer across different architectures, especially from Convolutional Neural Networks to Vision Transformers? (3) What is the most effective adversarial training strategy for robust defense? To answer these, we first propose a unified benchmark framework focused on digital, non-patch-based attacks. This framework introduces specific metrics to disentangle localization and classification errors and evaluates attack cost using multiple perceptual metrics. Using this benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments on state-of-the-art attacks and a wide range of detectors. Our findings reveal two major conclusions: first, modern adversarial attacks against object detection models show a significant lack of transferability to transformer-based architectures. Second, we demonstrate that the most robust adversarial training strategy leverages a dataset composed of a mix of high-perturbation attacks with different objectives (e.g., spatial and semantic), which outperforms training on any single attack.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vision and Language: Novel Representations and Artificial intelligence for Driving Scene Safety Assessment and Autonomous Vehicle Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07680v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently emerged as powerful representation learning systems that align visual observations with natural language concepts, offering new opportunities for semantic reasoning in safety-critical autonomous driving. This paper investigates how vision-language representations support driving scene safety assessment and decision-making when integrated into perception, prediction, and planning pipelines. We study three complementary system-level use cases. First, we introduce a lightweight, category-agnostic hazard screening approach leveraging CLIP-based image-text similarity to produce a low-latency semantic hazard signal. This enables robust detection of diverse and out-of-distribution road hazards without explicit object detection or visual question answering. Second, we examine the integration of scene-level vision-language embeddings into a transformer-based trajectory planning framework using the Waymo Open Dataset. Our results show that naively conditioning planners on global embeddings does not improve trajectory accuracy, highlighting the importance of representation-task alignment and motivating the development of task-informed extraction methods for safety-critical planning. Third, we investigate natural language as an explicit behavioral constraint on motion planning using the doScenes dataset. In this setting, passenger-style instructions grounded in visual scene elements suppress rare but severe planning failures and improve safety-aligned behavior in ambiguous scenarios. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that vision-language representations hold significant promise for autonomous driving safety when used to express semantic risk, intent, and behavioral constraints. Realizing this potential is fundamentally an engineering problem requiring careful system design and structured grounding rather than direct feature injection.</p></details> |  |

Analytical Modeling of Computational Reliability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16362v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Extreme Edge Computing (XEC) distributes streaming workloads across consumer-owned devices, exploiting their proximity to users and ubiquitous availability. Many such workloads are AI-driven, requiring continuous neural network inference for tasks like object detection and video analytics. Distributed Inference (DI), which partitions model execution across multiple edge devices, enables these streaming services to meet strict throughput and latency requirements. Yet consumer devices exhibit volatile computational availability due to competing applications and unpredictable usage patterns. This volatility poses a fundamental challenge: how can we quantify the probability that a device, or ensemble of devices, will maintain the processing rate required by a streaming service? This paper presents an analytical framework for computational reliability in XEC, defined as the probability that instantaneous capacity meets demand at a specified Quality of Service (QoS) threshold. We derive closed-form reliability expressions under two information regimes: Minimal Information (MI), requiring only declared operational bounds, and historical data, which refines estimates via Maximum Likelihood Estimation from past observations. The framework extends to multi-device deployments, providing reliability expressions for series, parallel, and partitioned workload configurations. We derive optimal workload allocation rules and analytical bounds for device selection, equipping orchestrators with tractable tools to evaluate deployment feasibility and configure distributed streaming systems. We validate the framework using real-time object detection with YOLO11m model as a representative DI streaming workload; experiments on emulated XED environments demonstrate close agreement between analytical predictions, Monte Carlo sampling, and empirical measurements across diverse capacity and demand configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Self-Supervised Approach for Enhanced Feature Representations in Object Detection Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16322v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the fast-evolving field of artificial intelligence, where models are increasingly growing in complexity and size, the availability of labeled data for training deep learning models has become a significant challenge. Addressing complex problems like object detection demands considerable time and resources for data labeling to achieve meaningful results. For companies developing such applications, this entails extensive investment in highly skilled personnel or costly outsourcing. This research work aims to demonstrate that enhancing feature extractors can substantially alleviate this challenge, enabling models to learn more effective representations with less labeled data. Utilizing a self-supervised learning strategy, we present a model trained on unlabeled data that outperforms state-of-the-art feature extractors pre-trained on ImageNet and particularly designed for object detection tasks. Moreover, the results demonstrate that our approach encourages the model to focus on the most relevant aspects of an object, thus achieving better feature representations and, therefore, reinforcing its reliability and robustness.</p></details> |  |

While structured weight pruning and token compression have emerged as promising solutions, they suffer from prolonged retraining times and global propagation that creates optimization challenges, respectively. We propose ToaSt, a decoupled framework applying specialized strategies to distinct ViT components. We apply coupled head-wise structured pruning to Multi-Head Self-Attention modules, leveraging attention operation characteristics to enhance robustness. For Feed-Forward Networks (over 60\% of FLOPs), we introduce Token Channel Selection (TCS) that enhances compression ratios while avoiding global propagation issues. Our analysis reveals TCS effectively filters redundant noise during selection. Extensive evaluations across nine diverse models, including DeiT, ViT-MAE, and Swin Transformer, demonstrate that ToaSt achieves superior trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency, consistently outperforming existing baselines. On ViT-MAE-Huge, ToaSt achieves 88.52\% accuracy (+1.64 \%) with 39.4\% FLOPs reduction. ToaSt transfers effectively to downstream tasks, achieving 52.2 versus 51.9 mAP on COCO object detection. Code and models will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 8 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Synthesizing Trajectory Queries from Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15164v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data scientists often need to write programs to process predictions of machine learning models, such as object detections and trajectories in video data. However, writing such queries can be challenging due to the fuzzy nature of real-world data; in particular, they often include real-valued parameters that must be tuned by hand. We propose a novel framework called Quivr that synthesizes trajectory queries matching a given set of examples. To efficiently synthesize parameters, we introduce a novel technique for pruning the parameter space and a novel quantitative semantics that makes this more efficient. We evaluate Quivr on a benchmark of 17 tasks, including several from prior work, and show both that it can synthesize accurate queries for each task and that our optimizations substantially reduce synthesis time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Zero-shot HOI Detection with MLLM-based Detector-agnostic Interaction Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15124v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-shot Human-object interaction (HOI) detection aims to locate humans and objects in images and recognize their interactions. While advances in open-vocabulary object detection provide promising solutions for object localization, interaction recognition (IR) remains challenging due to the combinatorial diversity of interactions. Existing methods, including two-stage methods, tightly couple IR with a specific detector and rely on coarse-grained vision-language model (VLM) features, which limit generalization to unseen interactions. In this work, we propose a decoupled framework that separates object detection from IR and leverages multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) for zero-shot IR. We introduce a deterministic generation method that formulates IR as a visual question answering task and enforces deterministic outputs, enabling training-free zero-shot IR. To further enhance performance and efficiency by fine-tuning the model, we design a spatial-aware pooling module that integrates appearance and pairwise spatial cues, and a one-pass deterministic matching method that predicts all candidate interactions in a single forward pass. Extensive experiments on HICO-DET and V-COCO demonstrate that our method achieves superior zero-shot performance, strong cross-dataset generalization, and the flexibility to integrate with any object detectors without retraining. The codes are publicly available at https://github.com/SY-Xuan/DA-HOI.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Explainability-Inspired Layer-Wise Pruning of Deep Neural Networks for Efficient Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14040v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success in object detection tasks, but their increasing complexity poses significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. While model compression techniques such as pruning have emerged as essential tools, traditional magnitude-based pruning methods do not necessarily align with the true functional contribution of network components to task-specific performance. In this work, we present an explainability-inspired, layer-wise pruning framework tailored for efficient object detection. Our approach leverages a SHAP-inspired gradient--activation attribution to estimate layer importance, providing a data-driven proxy for functional contribution rather than relying solely on static weight magnitudes. We conduct comprehensive experiments across diverse object detection architectures, including ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, ShuffleNetV2, Faster R-CNN, RetinaNet, and YOLOv8, evaluating performance on the Microsoft COCO 2017 validation set. The results show that the proposed attribution-inspired pruning consistently identifies different layers as least important compared to L1-norm-based methods, leading to improved accuracy--efficiency trade-offs. Notably, for ShuffleNetV2, our method yields a 10\% empirical increase in inference speed, whereas L1-pruning degrades performance by 13.7\%. For RetinaNet, the proposed approach preserves the baseline mAP (0.151) with negligible impact on inference speed, while L1-pruning incurs a 1.3\% mAP drop for a 6.2\% speed increase. These findings highlight the importance of data-driven layer importance assessment and demonstrate that explainability-inspired compression offers a principled direction for deploying deep neural networks on edge and resource-constrained platforms while preserving both performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[RoboAug: One Annotation to Hundreds of Scenes via Region-Contrastive Data Augmentation for Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14032v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing the generalization capability of robotic learning to enable robots to operate effectively in diverse, unseen scenes is a fundamental and challenging problem. Existing approaches often depend on pretraining with large-scale data collection, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming, or on semantic data augmentation techniques that necessitate an impractical assumption of flawless upstream object detection in real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose RoboAug, a novel generative data augmentation framework that significantly minimizes the reliance on large-scale pretraining and the perfect visual recognition assumption by requiring only the bounding box annotation of a single image during training. Leveraging this minimal information, RoboAug employs pre-trained generative models for precise semantic data augmentation and integrates a plug-and-play region-contrastive loss to help models focus on task-relevant regions, thereby improving generalization and boosting task success rates. We conduct extensive real-world experiments on three robots, namely UR-5e, AgileX, and Tien Kung 2.0, spanning over 35k rollouts. Empirical results demonstrate that RoboAug significantly outperforms state-of-the-art data augmentation baselines. Specifically, when evaluating generalization capabilities in unseen scenes featuring diverse combinations of backgrounds, distractors, and lighting conditions, our method achieves substantial gains over the baseline without augmentation. The success rates increase from 0.09 to 0.47 on UR-5e, from 0.16 to 0.60 on AgileX, and from 0.19 to 0.67 on Tien Kung 2.0. These results highlight the superior generalization and effectiveness of RoboAug in real-world manipulation tasks. Our project is available at https://x-roboaug.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explore Intrinsic Geometry for Query-based Tiny and Oriented Object Detector with Momentum-based Bipartite Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13728v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent query-based detectors have achieved remarkable progress, yet their performance remains constrained when handling objects with arbitrary orientations, especially for tiny objects capturing limited texture information. This limitation primarily stems from the underutilization of intrinsic geometry during pixel-based feature decoding and the occurrence of inter-stage matching inconsistency caused by stage-wise bipartite matching. To tackle these challenges, we present IGOFormer, a novel query-based oriented object detector that explicitly integrates intrinsic geometry into feature decoding and enhances inter-stage matching stability. Specifically, we design an Intrinsic Geometry-aware Decoder, which enhances the object-related features conditioned on an object query by injecting complementary geometric embeddings extrapolated from their correlations to capture the geometric layout of the object, thereby offering a critical geometric insight into its orientation. Meanwhile, a Momentum-based Bipartite Matching scheme is developed to adaptively aggregate historical matching costs by formulating an exponential moving average with query-specific smoothing factors, effectively preventing conflicting supervisory signals arising from inter-stage matching inconsistency. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the superiority of our IGOFormer for aerial oriented object detection, achieving an AP$_{50}$ score of 78.00\% on DOTA-V1.0 using Swin-T backbone under the single-scale setting. The code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Fine-tuned Vision Language Model for Localization of Parasitic Eggs in Microscopic Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13712v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections continuously affect a large proportion of the global population, particularly in tropical and sub-tropical regions, where access to specialized diagnostic expertise is limited. Although manual microscopic diagnosis of parasitic eggs remains the diagnostic gold standard, the approach can be labour-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to human error. This paper aims to utilize a vision language model (VLM) such as Microsoft Florence that was fine-tuned to localize all parasitic eggs within microscopic images. The preliminary results show that our localization VLM performs comparatively better than the other object detection methods, such as EfficientDet, with an mIOU of 0.94. This finding demonstrates the potential of the proposed VLM to serve as a core component of an automated framework, offering a scalable engineering solution for intelligent parasitological diagnosis.</p></details> |  |

However, radar-only 3D detection still trails LiDAR-based systems because radar point clouds are sparse, irregular, and often corrupted by multipath noise, yielding weak and unstable geometry. We present HyperDet, a detector-agnostic radar-only 3D detection framework that constructs a task-aware hyper 4D radar point cloud for standard LiDAR-oriented detectors. HyperDet aggregates returns from multiple surround-view 4D radars over consecutive frames to improve coverage and density, then applies geometry-aware cross-sensor consensus validation with a lightweight self-consistency check outside overlap regions to suppress inconsistent returns. It further integrates a foreground-focused diffusion module with training-time mixed radar-LiDAR supervision to densify object structures while lifting radar attributes (e.g., Doppler, RCS); the model is distilled into a consistency model for single-step inference. On MAN TruckScenes, HyperDet consistently improves over raw radar inputs with VoxelNeXt and CenterPoint, partially narrowing the radar-LiDAR gap. These results show that input-level refinement enables radar to better leverage LiDAR-oriented detectors without architectural modifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Current detectors struggle with UAV-specific challenges: targets spanning only a few pixels, cluttered backgrounds, heavy occlusion, and strict onboard computational budgets. This study introduces LAF-YOLOv10, built on YOLOv10n, integrating four complementary techniques to improve small-object detection in drone imagery. A Partial Convolution C2f (PC-C2f) module restricts spatial convolution to one quarter of backbone channels, reducing redundant computation while preserving discriminative capacity. An Attention-Guided Feature Pyramid Network (AG-FPN) inserts Squeeze-and-Excitation channel gates before multi-scale fusion and replaces nearest-neighbor upsampling with DySample for content-aware interpolation. An auxiliary P2 detection head at 160$\times$160 resolution extends localization to objects below 8$\times$8 pixels, while the P5 head is removed to redistribute parameters. Wise-IoU v3 replaces CIoU for bounding box regression, attenuating gradients from noisy annotations in crowded aerial scenes. The four modules address non-overlapping bottlenecks: PC-C2f compresses backbone computation, AG-FPN refines cross-scale fusion, the P2 head recovers spatial resolution, and Wise-IoU stabilizes regression under label noise. No individual component is novel; the contribution is the joint integration within a single YOLOv10 framework. Across three training runs (seeds 42, 123, 256), LAF-YOLOv10 achieves 35.1$\pm$0.3\% mAP@0.5 on VisDrone-DET2019 with 2.3\,M parameters, exceeding YOLOv10n by 3.3 points. Cross-dataset evaluation on UAVDT yields 35.8$\pm$0.4\% mAP@0.5. Benchmarks on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano confirm 24.3 FPS at FP16, demonstrating viability for embedded UAV deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robustness of Object Detection of Autonomous Vehicles in Adverse Weather Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12902v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As self-driving technology advances toward widespread adoption, determining safe operational thresholds across varying environmental conditions becomes critical for public safety. This paper proposes a method for evaluating the robustness of object detection ML models in autonomous vehicles under adverse weather conditions. It employs data augmentation operators to generate synthetic data that simulates different severance degrees of the adverse operation conditions at progressive intensity levels to find the lowest intensity of the adverse conditions at which the object detection model fails. The robustness of the object detection model is measured by the average first failure coefficients (AFFC) over the input images in the benchmark. The paper reports an experiment with four object detection models: YOLOv5s, YOLOv11s, Faster R-CNN, and Detectron2, utilising seven data augmentation operators that simulate weather conditions fog, rain, and snow, and lighting conditions of dark, bright, flaring, and shadow. The experiment data show that the method is feasible, effective, and efficient to evaluate and compare the robustness of object detection models in various adverse operation conditions. In particular, the Faster R-CNN model achieved the highest robustness with an overall average AFFC of 71.9% over all seven adverse conditions, while YOLO variants showed the AFFC values of 43%. The method is also applied to assess the impact of model training that targets adverse operation conditions using synthetic data on model robustness. It is observed that such training can improve robustness in adverse conditions but may suffer from diminishing returns and forgetting phenomena (i.e., decline in robustness) if overtrained.</p></details> |  |

Recent research indicates that using VLMs yields better RAG performance, but processing rich documents remains a challenge since a single page contains large amounts of information. In this paper, we present SCAN (SemantiC Document Layout ANalysis), a novel approach that enhances both textual and visual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems that work with visually rich documents. It is a VLM-friendly approach that identifies document components with appropriate semantic granularity, balancing context preservation with processing efficiency. SCAN uses a coarse-grained semantic approach that divides documents into coherent regions covering contiguous components. We trained the SCAN model by fine-tuning object detection models on an annotated dataset. Our experimental results across English and Japanese datasets demonstrate that applying SCAN improves end-to-end textual RAG performance by up to 9.4 points and visual RAG performance by up to 10.4 points, outperforming conventional approaches and even commercial document processing solutions.</p></details> |  |

The system consists of two components: (1) a social navigation framework implemented on a Raspberry Pi 5 that integrates real-time RGB-D perception using an OAK-D Lite camera, YOLOv8-based object detection, COMPOSER-based collective activity recognition, D* Lite dynamic path planning, and haptic feedback via vibration motors for tasks such as locating a vacant seat; and (2) an agentic multimodal LLM-VLM interaction framework that integrates speech recognition, vision language models, large language models, and text-to-speech, with dynamic routing between voice-only and vision-only modes to enable natural voice-based communication, scene description, and object localization from visual input. The system is evaluated through a combination of simulation-based tests, real-world field experiments, and user-centered studies. Results from simulated and real indoor environments demonstrate reliable obstacle avoidance and socially compliant navigation, achieving an overall system accuracy of approximately 80% under different social conditions. Group activity recognition further shows robust performance across diverse crowd scenarios. In addition, a preliminary exploratory user study with eight visually impaired and low-vision participants evaluates the agentic interaction framework through structured tasks and a UTAUT-based questionnaire reveals high acceptance and positive perceptions of usability, trust, and perceived sociability during our experiments. The results highlight the potential of PISHYAR as a multimodal assistive mobility aid that extends beyond navigation to provide socially interactive support for such users.</p></details> |  |

However, in CP, an ego agent needs to receive messages from its collaborators, which makes it vulnerable to attacks from malicious agents. To address this critical issue, we propose a unified, probability-agnostic, and adaptive framework, namely, CP-uniGuard, which is a tailored defense mechanism for CP deployed by each agent to accurately detect and eliminate malicious agents in its collaboration network. Our key idea is to enable CP to reach a consensus rather than a conflict against an ego agent's perception results. Based on this idea, we first develop a probability-agnostic sample consensus (PASAC) method to effectively sample a subset of the collaborators and verify the consensus without prior probabilities of malicious agents. Furthermore, we define collaborative consistency loss (CCLoss) for object detection task and bird's eye view (BEV) segmentation task to capture the discrepancy between an ego agent and its collaborators, which is used as a verification criterion for consensus. In addition, we propose online adaptive threshold via dual sliding windows to dynamically adjust the threshold for consensus verification and ensure the reliability of the systems in dynamic environments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework. Code is available at https://github.com/CP-Security/CP-uniGuard.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing (TMC)</p></details> |

This limitation arises because relying solely on text instructions is inadequate to direct the policy's attention toward the target object in complex and dynamic environments. To solve this problem, we propose leveraging bounding-box instruction to directly specify target object, and further investigate whether data scaling laws exist in semantic manipulation tasks. Specifically, we design a handheld segmentation device with an automated annotation pipeline, Label-UMI, which enables the efficient collection of demonstration data with semantic labels. We further propose a semantic-motion-decoupled framework that integrates object detection and bounding-box guided diffusion policy to improve generalization and adaptability in semantic manipulation. Throughout extensive real-world experiments on large-scale datasets, we validate the effectiveness of the approach, and reveal a power-law relationship between generalization performance and the number of bounding-box objects. Finally, we summarize an effective data collection strategy for semantic manipulation, which can achieve 85\% success rates across four tasks on both seen and unseen objects. All datasets and code will be released to the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Image Zoom-in with Bounding Box Transformation for UAV Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07512v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting objects from UAV-captured images is challenging due to the small object size. In this work, a simple and efficient adaptive zoom-in framework is explored for object detection on UAV images. The main motivation is that the foreground objects are generally smaller and sparser than those in common scene images, which hinders the optimization of effective object detectors. We thus aim to zoom in adaptively on the objects to better capture object features for the detection task. To achieve the goal, two core designs are required: \textcolor{black}{i) How to conduct non-uniform zooming on each image efficiently? ii) How to enable object detection training and inference with the zoomed image space?} Correspondingly, a lightweight offset prediction scheme coupled with a novel box-based zooming objective is introduced to learn non-uniform zooming on the input image. Based on the learned zooming transformation, a corner-aligned bounding box transformation method is proposed. The method warps the ground-truth bounding boxes to the zoomed space to learn object detection, and warps the predicted bounding boxes back to the original space during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on three representative UAV object detection datasets, including VisDrone, UAVDT, and SeaDronesSee. The proposed ZoomDet is architecture-independent and can be applied to an arbitrary object detection architecture. Remarkably, on the SeaDronesSee dataset, ZoomDet offers more than 8.4 absolute gain of mAP with a Faster R-CNN model, with only about 3 ms additional latency. The code is available at https://github.com/twangnh/zoomdet_code.</p></details> | <details><summary>paper...</summary><p>paper accepted by ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing ( IF=12.2)</p></details> |

Cameras provide dense visual cues but ill posed depth; LiDAR provides a precise 3D structure but sparse coverage. Existing BEV-based fusion frameworks have made good progress, but they have difficulties including inefficient context modeling, spatially invariant fusion, and reasoning under uncertainty. We introduce MambaFusion, a unified multi-modal detection framework that achieves efficient, adaptive, and physically grounded 3D perception. MambaFusion interleaves selective state-space models (SSMs) with windowed transformers to propagate the global context in linear time while preserving local geometric fidelity. A multi-modal token alignment (MTA) module and reliability-aware fusion gates dynamically re-weight camera-LiDAR features based on spatial confidence and calibration consistency. Finally, a structure-conditioned diffusion head integrates graph-based reasoning with uncertainty-aware denoising, enforcing physical plausibility, and calibrated confidence. MambaFusion establishes new state-of-the-art performance on nuScenes benchmarks while operating with linear-time complexity. The framework demonstrates that coupling SSM-based efficiency with reliability-driven fusion yields robust, temporally stable, and interpretable 3D perception for real-world autonomous driving systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Look Spatial Reasoning for Dense Surgical Instrument Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11024v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate counting of surgical instruments in Operating Rooms (OR) is a critical prerequisite for ensuring patient safety during surgery. Despite recent progress of large visual-language models and agentic AI, accurately counting such instruments remains highly challenging, particularly in dense scenarios where instruments are tightly clustered. To address this problem, we introduce Chain-of-Look, a novel visual reasoning framework that mimics the sequential human counting process by enforcing a structured visual chain, rather than relying on classic object detection which is unordered. This visual chain guides the model to count along a coherent spatial trajectory, improving accuracy in complex scenes. To further enforce the physical plausibility of the visual chain, we introduce the neighboring loss function, which explicitly models the spatial constraints inherent to densely packed surgical instruments. We also present SurgCount-HD, a new dataset comprising 1,464 high-density surgical instrument images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches for counting (e.g., CountGD, REC) as well as Multimodality Large Language Models (e.g., Qwen, ChatGPT) in the challenging task of dense surgical instrument counting.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to WACV 2026.

| **[Are Dense Labels Always Necessary for 3D Object Detection from Point Cloud?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02818v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object detection methods often require a large amount of 3D bounding box annotations for training. However, collecting such large-scale densely-supervised datasets is notoriously costly. To reduce the cumbersome data annotation process, we propose a novel sparsely-annotated framework, in which we just annotate one 3D object per scene. Such a sparse annotation strategy could significantly reduce the heavy annotation burden, while inexact and incomplete sparse supervision may severely deteriorate the detection performance. To address this issue, we develop the SS3D++ method that alternatively improves 3D detector training and confident fully-annotated scene generation in a unified learning scheme. Using sparse annotations as seeds, we progressively generate confident fully-annotated scenes based on designing a missing-annotated instance mining module and reliable background mining module. Our proposed method produces competitive results when compared with SOTA weakly-supervised methods using the same or even more annotation costs. Besides, compared with SOTA fully-supervised methods, we achieve on-par or even better performance on the KITTI dataset with about 5x less annotation cost, and 90% of their performance on the Waymo dataset with about 15x less annotation cost. The additional unlabeled training scenes could further boost the performance.</p></details> | update |

However, it remains challenging due to cluttered backgrounds, severe scale variation, and large orientation changes. Existing approaches largely improve performance through multi-scale feature fusion with feature pyramid networks or contextual modeling with attention, but they often lack explicit foreground modeling and do not leverage geometric orientation priors, which limits feature discriminability. To overcome these limitations, we propose FGAA-FPN, a Foreground-Guided Angle-Aware Feature Pyramid Network for oriented object detection. FGAA-FPN is built on a hierarchical functional decomposition that accounts for the distinct spatial resolution and semantic abstraction across pyramid levels, thereby strengthening multi-scale representations. Concretely, a Foreground-Guided Feature Modulation module learns foreground saliency under weak supervision to enhance object regions and suppress background interference in low-level features. In parallel, an Angle-Aware Multi-Head Attention module encodes relative orientation relationships to guide global interactions among high-level semantic features. Extensive experiments on DOTA v1.0 and DOTA v1.5 demonstrate that FGAA-FPN achieves state-of-the-art results, reaching 75.5% and 68.3% mAP, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The Visual Computer</p></details> |

However, developing reliable AI systems for autonomous vehicles remains a substantial challenge. Over the past decade, multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful approach to address complex problems in driving perception. Multi-task networks offer several advantages, including increased computational efficiency, real-time processing capabilities, optimized resource utilization, and improved generalization. In this study, we present AurigaNet, an advanced multi-task network architecture designed to push the boundaries of autonomous driving perception. AurigaNet integrates three critical tasks: object detection, lane detection, and drivable area instance segmentation. The system is trained and evaluated using the BDD100K dataset, renowned for its diversity in driving conditions. Key innovations of AurigaNet include its end-to-end instance segmentation capability, which significantly enhances both accuracy and efficiency in path estimation for autonomous vehicles. Experimental results demonstrate that AurigaNet achieves an 85.2% IoU in drivable area segmentation, outperforming its closest competitor by 0.7%. In lane detection, AurigaNet achieves a remarkable 60.8% IoU, surpassing other models by more than 30%. Furthermore, the network achieves an mAP@0.5:0.95 of 47.6% in traffic object detection, exceeding the next leading model by 2.9%. Additionally, we validate the practical feasibility of AurigaNet by deploying it on embedded devices such as the Jetson Orin NX, where it demonstrates competitive real-time performance. These results underscore AurigaNet's potential as a robust and efficient solution for autonomous driving perception systems.

| **[1%>100%: High-Efficiency Visual Adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10513v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying vision foundation models typically relies on efficient adaptation strategies, whereas conventional full fine-tuning suffers from prohibitive costs and low efficiency. While delta-tuning has proven effective in boosting the performance and efficiency of LLMs during adaptation, its advantages cannot be directly transferred to the fine-tuning pipeline of vision foundation models. To push the boundaries of adaptation efficiency for vision tasks, we propose an adapter with Complex Linear Projection Optimization (CoLin). For architecture, we design a novel low-rank complex adapter that introduces only about 1% parameters to the backbone. For efficiency, we theoretically prove that low-rank composite matrices suffer from severe convergence issues during training, and address this challenge with a tailored loss. Extensive experiments on object detection, segmentation, image classification, and rotated object detection (remote sensing scenario) demonstrate that CoLin outperforms both full fine-tuning and classical delta-tuning approaches with merely 1% parameters for the first time, providing a novel and efficient solution for deployment of vision foundation models.

| **[Synthesizing the Kill Chain: A Zero-Shot Framework for Target Verification and Tactical Reasoning on the Edge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13324v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying autonomous edge robotics in dynamic military environments is constrained by both scarce domain-specific training data and the computational limits of edge hardware. This paper introduces a hierarchical, zero-shot framework that cascades lightweight object detection with compact Vision-Language Models (VLMs) from the Qwen and Gemma families (4B-12B parameters). Grounding DINO serves as a high-recall, text-promptable region proposer, and frames with high detection confidence are passed to edge-class VLMs for semantic verification. We evaluate this pipeline on 55 high-fidelity synthetic videos from Battlefield 6 across three tasks: false-positive filtering (up to 100% accuracy), damage assessment (up to 97.5%), and fine-grained vehicle classification (55-90%). We further extend the pipeline into an agentic Scout-Commander workflow, achieving 100% correct asset deployment and a 9.8/10 reasoning score (graded by GPT-4o) with sub-75-second latency. A novel "Controlled Input" methodology decouples perception from reasoning, revealing distinct failure phenotypes: Gemma3-12B excels at tactical logic but fails in visual perception, while Gemma3-4B exhibits reasoning collapse even with accurate inputs. These findings validate hierarchical zero-shot architectures for edge autonomy and provide a diagnostic framework for certifying VLM suitability in safety-critical applications.</p></details> | 8 Pages, 3 Figures |

The dataset was collected in an outdoor environment, where volunteers used wheelchairs, canes, and walkers, resulting in nine categories of pedestrians: pedestrians, cane users, two types of walker users, whether walking or resting, five types of wheelchair users, including wheelchair users, people pushing empty wheelchairs, and three types of users pushing occupied wheelchairs, including the entire pushing group, the pusher and the person seated on the wheelchair. To establish a benchmark, seven object detection models (Faster R-CNN, CenterNet, YOLOX, DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO, and RT-DETR) and three tracking algorithms (ByteTrack, BOT-SORT, and OC-SORT) were implemented under the MMDetection framework. Experimental results show that YOLOX, Deformable DETR, and Faster R-CNN achieve the best detection performance, while the differences among the three trackers are relatively small. The PMMA dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5683/SP3/XJPQUG, and the video processing and model training code is available at https://github.com/DatasetPMMA/PMMA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to the journal IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, under review</p></details> |

In contrast, recent generic object trackers are often optimized for training targets, which limits robustness and generalization in unseen scenarios, and their occlusion reasoning remains coarse, lacking detailed modeling of occlusion patterns. To address these limitations in generalization and occlusion perception, we propose GOT-JEPA, a model-predictive pretraining framework that extends JEPA from predicting image features to predicting tracking models. Given identical historical information, a teacher predictor generates pseudo-tracking models from a clean current frame, and a student predictor learns to predict the same pseudo-tracking models from a corrupted version of the current frame. This design provides stable pseudo supervision and explicitly trains the predictor to produce reliable tracking models under occlusions, distractors, and other adverse observations, improving generalization to dynamic environments. Building on GOT-JEPA, we further propose OccuSolver to enhance occlusion perception for object tracking. OccuSolver adapts a point-centric point tracker for object-aware visibility estimation and detailed occlusion-pattern capture. Conditioned on object priors iteratively generated by the tracker, OccuSolver incrementally refines visibility states, strengthens occlusion handling, and produces higher-quality reference labels that progressively improve subsequent model predictions. Extensive evaluations on seven benchmarks show that our method effectively enhances tracker generalization and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Learn...</summary><p>Learning Model Adaptation for Adverse and Dynamic Environments</p></details> |
| **[Offline-Poly: A Polyhedral Framework For Offline 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13772v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Offline 3D multi-object tracking (MOT) is a critical component of the 4D auto-labeling (4DAL) process. It enhances pseudo-labels generated by high-performance detectors through the incorporation of temporal context. However, existing offline 3D MOT approaches are direct extensions of online frameworks and fail to fully exploit the advantages of offline setting. Moreover, these methods often depend on fixed upstream and customized architectures, limiting their adaptability. To address these limitations, we propose Offline-Poly, a general offline 3D MOT method based on a tracking-centric design. We introduce a standardized paradigm termed Tracking-by-Tracking (TBT), which operates exclusively on arbitrary off-the-shelf tracking outputs and produces offline-refined tracklets. This formulation decouples offline tracker from specific upstream detectors or trackers. Under the TBT paradigm, Offline-Poly accepts one or multiple coarse tracking results and processes them through a structured pipeline comprising pre-processing, hierarchical matching and fusion, and tracklet refinement. Each module is designed to capitalize on the two fundamental properties of offline tracking: resource unconstrainedness, which permits global optimization beyond real-time limits, and future observability, which enables tracklet reasoning over the full temporal horizon. Offline-Poly first eliminates short-term ghost tracklets and re-identifies fragmented segments using global scene context. It then constructs scene-level similarity to associate tracklets across multiple input sources. Finally, Offline-Poly refines tracklets by jointly leveraging local and global motion patterns. On nuScenes, we achieve SOTA performance with 77.6% AMOTA. On KITTI, it achieves leading results with 83.00% HOTA. Comprehensive experiments further validate the flexibility, generalizability, and modular effectiveness of Offline-Poly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Based...</summary><p>Based on this work, we achieved 1st place on the KITTI tracking leaderboard</p></details> |

Addressing the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency, especially under challenging conditions like unpredictable occlusion, remains a significant challenge. This paper introduces LGTrack, a unified UAV tracking framework that integrates dynamic layer selection, efficient feature enhancement, and robust representation learning for occlusions. By employing a novel lightweight Global-Grouped Coordinate Attention (GGCA) module, LGTrack captures long-range dependencies and global contexts, enhancing feature discriminability with minimal computational overhead. Additionally, a lightweight Similarity-Guided Layer Adaptation (SGLA) module replaces knowledge distillation, achieving an optimal balance between tracking precision and inference efficiency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate LGTrack's state-of-the-art real-time speed (258.7 FPS on UAVDT) while maintaining competitive tracking accuracy (82.8\% precision).

| **[Detecting Object Tracking Failure via Sequential Hypothesis Testing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12983v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time online object tracking in videos constitutes a core task in computer vision, with wide-ranging applications including video surveillance, motion capture, and robotics. Deployed tracking systems usually lack formal safety assurances to convey when tracking is reliable and when it may fail, at best relying on heuristic measures of model confidence to raise alerts. To obtain such assurances we propose interpreting object tracking as a sequential hypothesis test, wherein evidence for or against tracking failures is gradually accumulated over time. Leveraging recent advancements in the field, our sequential test (formalized as an e-process) quickly identifies when tracking failures set in whilst provably containing false alerts at a desired rate, and thus limiting potentially costly re-calibration or intervention steps. The approach is computationally light-weight, requires no extra training or fine-tuning, and is in principle model-agnostic. We propose both supervised and unsupervised variants by leveraging either ground-truth or solely internal tracking information, and demonstrate its effectiveness for two established tracking models across four video benchmarks. As such, sequential testing can offer a statistically grounded and efficient mechanism to incorporate safety assurances into real-time tracking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in WACV workshop "Real World Surveillance: Applications and Challenges, 6th"</p></details> |
| **[Easy-Poly: An Easy Polyhedral Framework For 3D Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17822v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent 3D multi-object tracking (3D MOT) methods mainly follow tracking-by-detection pipelines, but often suffer from high false positives, missed detections, and identity switches, especially in crowded and small-object scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose Easy-Poly, a filter-based 3D MOT framework with four key innovations: (1) CNMSMM, a novel Camera-LiDAR fusion detection method combining multi-modal augmentation and an efficient NMS with a new loss function to improve small target detection; (2) Dynamic Track-Oriented (DTO) data association that robustly handles uncertainties and occlusions via class-aware optimal assignment and parallel processing strategies; (3) Dynamic Motion Modeling (DMM) using a confidence-weighted Kalman filter with adaptive noise covariance to enhance tracking accuracy; and (4) an extended life-cycle management system reducing identity switches and false terminations. Experimental results show that Easy-Poly outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as Poly-MOT and Fast-Poly, achieving notable gains in mAP (e.g., from 63.30% to 65.65% with LargeKernel3D) and AMOTA (e.g., from 73.1% to 75.6%), while also running in real-time. Our framework advances robustness and adaptability in complex driving environments, paving the way for safer autonomous driving perception.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections, detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates. The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable. Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub: https://github.com/SDU-VelKoTek/GenTrack2</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Vizing Chains: Improved Recourse in Dynamic Edge Coloring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09497v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the maintenance of a $(Δ+C)$-edge-coloring ($C\ge 1$) in a fully dynamic graph $G$ with maximum degree $Δ$. We focus on minimizing \emph{recourse} which equals the number of recolored edges per edge updates. We present a new technique based on an object which we call a \emph{shift-tree}. This object tracks multiple possible recolorings of $G$ and enables us to maintain a proper coloring with small recourse in polynomial time. We shift colors over a path of edges, but unlike many other algorithms, we do not use \emph{fans} and \emph{alternating bicolored paths}. We combine the shift-tree with additional techniques to obtain an algorithm with a \emph{tight} recourse of $O\big( \frac{\log n}{\log \frac{Δ+C}{Δ-C}}\big)$ for all $C \ge 0.62Δ$ where $Δ-C = O(n^{1-δ})$. Our algorithm is the first deterministic algorithm to establish tight bounds for large palettes, and the first to do so when $Δ-C=o(Δ)$. This result settles the theoretical complexity of the recourse for large palettes. Furthermore, we believe that viewing the possible shifts as a tree can lead to similar tree-based techniques that extend to lower values of $C$, and to improved update times. A second application is to graphs with low arboricity $α$. Previous works [BCPS24, CRV24] achieve $O(ε^{-1}\log n)$ recourse per update with $C\ge (4+ε)α$, and we improve by achieving the same recourse while only requiring $C \ge (2+ε)α- 1$. This result is $Δ$-adaptive, i.e., it uses $Δ_t+C$ colors where $Δ_t$ is the current maximum degree. Trying to understand the limitations of our technique, and shift-based algorithms in general, we show a separation between the recourse achievable by algorithms that only shift colors along a path, and more general algorithms such as ones using the Nibbling Method [BGW21, BCPS24].</p></details> |  |

However, existing RMOT paradigms are largely designed for explicit instructions and consequently fail to generalize to complex instructions that require logical reasoning. To overcome this, we propose Reasoning-based Multi-Object Tracking (ReaMOT), a novel task that requires models to identify and track targets that satisfy implicit constraints via logical reasoning. To advance this field, we construct the ReaMOT Challenge, a comprehensive benchmark comprising: (1) a large-scale dataset with 1,156 instructions categorized into High-Level Reasoning and Low-Level Perception, covering 423,359 image-language pairs across 869 diverse scenes; and (2) a tailored metric suite designed to jointly evaluate reasoning accuracy and tracking robustness. Furthermore, we propose ReaTrack, a training-free framework that synergizes the reasoning capabilities of Thinking-variant Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) with the precise temporal modeling of SAM2. Extensive experiments on the ReaMOT Challenge benchmark demonstrates the effectiveness of our ReaTrack framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/chen-si-jia/ReaMOT</p></details> |
| **[GOT-Edit: Geometry-Aware Generic Object Tracking via Online Model Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08550v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human perception for effective object tracking in a 2D video stream arises from the implicit use of prior 3D knowledge combined with semantic reasoning. In contrast, most generic object tracking (GOT) methods primarily rely on 2D features of the target and its surroundings while neglecting 3D geometric cues, which makes them susceptible to partial occlusion, distractors, and variations in geometry and appearance. To address this limitation, we introduce GOT-Edit, an online cross-modality model editing approach that integrates geometry-aware cues into a generic object tracker from a 2D video stream. Our approach leverages features from a pre-trained Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer to enable geometric cue inference from only a few 2D images. To tackle the challenge of seamlessly combining geometry and semantics, GOT-Edit performs online model editing with null-space constrained updates that incorporate geometric information while preserving semantic discrimination, yielding consistently better performance across diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments on multiple GOT benchmarks demonstrate that GOT-Edit achieves superior robustness and accuracy, particularly under occlusion and clutter, establishing a new paradigm for combining 2D semantics with 3D geometric reasoning for generic object tracking.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

Specifically, changes in the scene background not only render traditional frame-to-frame object IoU association methods ineffective but also introduce significant view shifts in the objects, which complicates tracking. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel HomView-MOT framework, which for the first time, harnesses the view homography inherent in changing scenes to solve MOT challenges in moving environments, incorporating homographic matching and view-centric concepts. We introduce a Fast Homography Estimation (FHE) algorithm for rapid computation of homography matrices between video frames, enabling object View-Centric ID Learning (VCIL) and leveraging multi-view homography to learn cross-view ID features. Concurrently, our Homographic Matching Filter (HMF) maps object bounding boxes from different frames onto a common view plane for a more realistic physical IoU association. Extensive experiments have proven that these innovations allow HomView-MOT to achieve state-of-the-art performance on prominent UAV MOT datasets VisDrone and UAVDT.</p></details> | TGRS 2026 |

These capabilities, however, also create new security risks. In this paper, we introduce CHAI (Command Hijacking against embodied AI), a physical environment indirect prompt injection attack that exploits the multimodal language interpretation abilities of AI models. CHAI embeds deceptive natural language instructions, such as misleading signs, in visual input, systematically searches the token space, builds a dictionary of prompts, and guides an attacker model to generate Visual Attack Prompts. We evaluate CHAI on four LVLM agents: drone emergency landing, autonomous driving, aerial object tracking, and on a real robotic vehicle. Our experiments show that CHAI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art attacks. By exploiting the semantic and multimodal reasoning strengths of next-generation embodied AI systems, CHAI underscores the urgent need for defenses that extend beyond traditional adversarial robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at the IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (SaTML).

This makes detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e., PCR quality validation, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art classification-based method.</p></details> |  |
| **[DRMOT: A Dataset and Framework for RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04692v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track specific targets based on language descriptions and is vital for interactive AI systems such as robotics and autonomous driving. However, existing RMOT models rely solely on 2D RGB data, making it challenging to accurately detect and associate targets characterized by complex spatial semantics (e.g., ``the person closest to the camera'') and to maintain reliable identities under severe occlusion, due to the absence of explicit 3D spatial information. In this work, we propose a novel task, RGBD Referring Multi-Object Tracking (DRMOT), which explicitly requires models to fuse RGB, Depth (D), and Language (L) modalities to achieve 3D-aware tracking. To advance research on the DRMOT task, we construct a tailored RGBD referring multi-object tracking dataset, named DRSet, designed to evaluate models' spatial-semantic grounding and tracking capabilities. Specifically, DRSet contains RGB images and depth maps from 187 scenes, along with 240 language descriptions, among which 56 descriptions incorporate depth-related information. Furthermore, we propose DRTrack, a MLLM-guided depth-referring tracking framework. DRTrack performs depth-aware target grounding from joint RGB-D-L inputs and enforces robust trajectory association by incorporating depth cues. Extensive experiments on the DRSet dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/chen-si-jia/DRMOT</p></details> |

However, most existing systems depend on pre-scanned, static environments and rely heavily on continuous tracking or marker-based solutions, which limit adaptability in dynamic physical spaces. This is particularly problematic for AR headsets and glasses, which typically follow the user's head movement and cannot maintain a fixed, stationary view of the scene. Moreover, continuous scene observation is neither power-efficient nor practical for wearable devices, given their limited battery and processing capabilities. A persistent challenge arises when multiple identical objects are present in the environment-standard object tracking pipelines often fail to maintain consistent identities without uninterrupted observation or external sensors. These limitations hinder fluid physical-virtual interactions, especially in dynamic or occluded scenes where continuous tracking is infeasible. To address this, we introduce a novel optimization-based framework for re-identifying identical objects in AR scenes using only one partial egocentric observation frame captured by a headset. We formulate the problem as a label assignment task solved via integer programming, augmented with a Voronoi diagram-based pruning strategy to improve computational efficiency. This method reduces computation time by 50% while preserving 91% accuracy in simulated experiments. Moreover, we evaluated our approach in quantitative synthetic and quantitative real-world experiments. We also conducted three qualitative real-world experiments to demonstrate the practical utility and generalizability for enabling dynamic, markerless object interaction in AR environments.

The system reconstructs binary event frames using run-length encoding, generates region proposals, and adaptively switches between frame mode and event mode based on object size and velocity. A Fast Object Tracking Unit improves robustness for high-speed targets through adaptive thresholding and trajectory-based classification. The neural processing unit supports both grayscale-patch and trajectory inference with a custom instruction set and a zero-skipping MAC architecture, reducing redundant neural computations by more than 97 percent.

Unlike prior graph-based MOT methods that redesign tracking architectures, UniTrack provides a universal training objective that integrates detection accuracy, identity preservation, and spatiotemporal consistency into a single end-to-end trainable loss function, enabling seamless integration with existing MOT systems without architectural modifications. Through differentiable graph representation learning, UniTrack enables networks to learn holistic representations of motion continuity and identity relationships across frames. We validate UniTrack across diverse tracking models and multiple challenging benchmarks, demonstrating consistent improvements across all tested architectures and datasets including Trackformer, MOTR, FairMOT, ByteTrack, GTR, and MOTE. Extensive evaluations show up to 53\% reduction in identity switches and 12\% IDF1 improvements across challenging benchmarks, with GTR achieving peak performance gains of 9.7\% MOTA on SportsMOT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dictionary Learning under Symmetries via Group Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19557v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dictionary learning problem can be viewed as a data-driven process to learn a suitable transformation so that data is sparsely represented directly from example data. In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures |

While deep learning-based solutions have demonstrated impressive 3D MOT performance, model-based approaches remain appealing for their simplicity, interpretability, and data efficiency. Conventional model-based trackers typically rely on random vector-based Bayesian filters within the tracking-by-detection (TBD) framework but face limitations due to heuristic data association and track management schemes. In contrast, random finite set (RFS)-based Bayesian filtering handles object birth, survival, and death in a theoretically sound manner, facilitating interpretability and parameter tuning. In this paper, we present OptiPMB, a novel RFS-based 3D MOT method that employs an optimized Poisson multi-Bernoulli (PMB) filter while incorporating several key innovative designs within the TBD framework. Specifically, we propose a measurement-driven hybrid adaptive birth model for improved track initialization, employ adaptive detection probability parameters to effectively maintain tracks for occluded objects, and optimize density pruning and track extraction modules to further enhance overall tracking performance. Extensive evaluations on nuScenes and KITTI datasets show that OptiPMB achieves superior tracking accuracy compared with state-of-the-art methods, thereby establishing a new benchmark for model-based 3D MOT and offering valuable insights for future research on RFS-based trackers in autonomous driving.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAD-SLAM: Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM with Dynamic-Static Decoupled Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19420v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural radiation fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian-based SLAM have achieved impressive localization accuracy and high-quality dense mapping in static scenes. However, these methods remain challenged in dynamic environments, where moving objects violate the static-world assumption and introduce inconsistent observations that degrade both camera tracking and map reconstruction. This motivates two fundamental problems: robustly identifying dynamic objects and modeling them online. To address these limitations, we propose CAD-SLAM, a Consistency-Aware Dynamic SLAM framework with dynamic-static decoupled mapping. Our key insight is that dynamic objects inherently violate cross-view and cross-time scene consistency. We detect object motion by analyzing geometric and texture discrepancies between historical map renderings and real-world observations. Once a moving object is identified, we perform bidirectional dynamic object tracking (both backward and forward in time) to achieve complete sequence-wise dynamic recognition. Our consistency-aware dynamic detection model achieves category-agnostic, instantaneous dynamic identification, which effectively mitigates motion-induced interference during localization and mapping. In addition, we introduce a dynamic-static decoupled mapping strategy that employs a temporal Gaussian model for online incremental dynamic modeling. Experiments conducted on multiple dynamic datasets demonstrate the flexible and accurate dynamic segmentation capabilities of our method, along with the state-of-the-art performance in both localization and mapping.</p></details> |  |

These difficulties are further exacerbated by the geometric distortion and extreme scale variation introduced by static fisheye cameras. In this work, we present GTATrack, a hierarchical tracking framework that win first place in the SoccerTrack Challenge 2025. GTATrack integrates two core components: Deep Expansion IoU (Deep-EIoU) for motion-agnostic online association and Global Tracklet Association (GTA) for trajectory-level refinement. This two-stage design enables both robust short-term matching and long-term identity consistency. Additionally, a pseudo-labeling strategy is used to boost detector recall on small and distorted targets. The synergy between local association and global reasoning effectively addresses identity switches, occlusions, and tracking fragmentation. Our method achieved a winning HOTA score of 0.60 and significantly reduced false positives to 982, demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy in fisheye-based soccer tracking.

| **[MCTR: Multi Camera Tracking Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13243v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-camera tracking plays a pivotal role in various real-world applications. While end-to-end methods have gained significant interest in single-camera tracking, multi-camera tracking remains predominantly reliant on heuristic techniques. In response to this gap, this paper introduces Multi-Camera Tracking tRansformer (MCTR), a novel end-to-end approach tailored for multi-object detection and tracking across multiple cameras with overlapping fields of view. MCTR leverages end-to-end detectors like DEtector TRansformer (DETR) to produce detections and detection embeddings independently for each camera view. The framework maintains set of track embeddings that encaplusate global information about the tracked objects, and updates them at every frame by integrating the local information from the view-specific detection embeddings. The track embeddings are probabilistically associated with detections in every camera view and frame to generate consistent object tracks. The soft probabilistic association facilitates the design of differentiable losses that enable end-to-end training of the entire system. To validate our approach, we conduct experiments on MMPTrack and AI City Challenge, two recently introduced large-scale multi-camera multi-object tracking datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, automation of the inspection task is a challenging problem as it requires precise navigation to capture images from optimal distances and viewing angles. This paper presents a novel localization pipeline that directly integrates PV module detection with UAV navigation, allowing precise positioning during inspection. The detections are used to identify the power plant structures in the image. These are associated with the power plant model and used to infer the UAV position relative to the inspected PV installation. We define visually recognizable anchor points for the initial association and use object tracking to discern global associations. Additionally, we present three different methods for visual segmentation of PV modules and evaluate their performance in relation to the proposed localization pipeline. The presented methods were verified and evaluated using custom aerial inspection data sets, demonstrating their robustness and applicability for real-time navigation. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of the power plant model precision on the localization methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 23 figures.

The dataset is the first to provide large-scale, fine-grained annotations for racket pose alongside traditional ball positions, enabling research into complex human-object interactions. It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines. RacketVision provides a versatile resource and a strong starting point for future research in dynamic object tracking, conditional motion forecasting, and multimodal analysis in sports.

This paper presents an AI-enabled burn assessment and management platform that integrates multi-view photogrammetry, 3D surface reconstruction, and deep learning-based segmentation within a structured clinical workflow. Using standard multi-angle images from consumer-grade cameras, the system reconstructs patient-specific 3D burn surfaces and maps burn regions onto anatomy to compute objective metrics in real-world units, including surface area, TBSA, depth-related geometric proxies, and volumetric change. Successive reconstructions are spatially aligned to quantify healing progression over time, enabling objective tracking of wound contraction and depth reduction. The platform also supports structured patient intake, guided image capture, 3D analysis and visualization, treatment recommendations, and automated report generation. Simulation-based evaluation demonstrates stable reconstructions, consistent metric computation, and clinically plausible longitudinal trends, supporting a scalable, non-invasive approach to objective, geometry-aware burn assessment and decision support in acute and outpatient care.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages and 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[UBATrack: Spatio-Temporal State Space Model for General Multi-Modal Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14799v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal object tracking has attracted considerable attention by integrating multiple complementary inputs (e.g., thermal, depth, and event data) to achieve outstanding performance. Although current general-purpose multi-modal trackers primarily unify various modal tracking tasks (i.e., RGB-Thermal infrared, RGB-Depth or RGB-Event tracking) through prompt learning, they still overlook the effective capture of spatio-temporal cues. In this work, we introduce a novel multi-modal tracking framework based on a mamba-style state space model, termed UBATrack. Our UBATrack comprises two simple yet effective modules: a Spatio-temporal Mamba Adapter (STMA) and a Dynamic Multi-modal Feature Mixer. The former leverages Mamba's long-sequence modeling capability to jointly model cross-modal dependencies and spatio-temporal visual cues in an adapter-tuning manner. The latter further enhances multi-modal representation capacity across multiple feature dimensions to improve tracking robustness. In this way, UBATrack eliminates the need for costly full-parameter fine-tuning, thereby improving the training efficiency of multi-modal tracking algorithms. Experiments show that UBATrack outperforms state-of-the-art methods on RGB-T, RGB-D, and RGB-E tracking benchmarks, achieving outstanding results on the LasHeR, RGBT234, RGBT210, DepthTrack, VOT-RGBD22, and VisEvent datasets.</p></details> |  |

However, their training on static, web-sourced image-text pairs fundamentally limits the precise spatiotemporal reasoning required to understand and predict dynamic traffic scenes. We address this critical gap with STRIDE-QA, a large-scale visual question answering (VQA) dataset for physically grounded reasoning from an ego-centric perspective. Constructed from 100 hours of multi-sensor driving data in Tokyo, capturing diverse and challenging conditions, STRIDE-QA is the largest VQA dataset for spatiotemporal reasoning in urban driving, offering 16M QA pairs over 270K frames. Grounded by dense, automatically generated annotations including 3D bounding boxes, segmentation masks, and multi-object tracks, the dataset uniquely supports both object-centric and ego-centric reasoning through three novel QA tasks that require spatial localization and temporal prediction. Our benchmarks demonstrate that existing VLMs struggle significantly, with near-zero scores on prediction consistency. In contrast, VLMs fine-tuned on STRIDE-QA exhibit dramatic performance gains, achieving 55% success in spatial localization and 28% consistency in future motion prediction, compared to near-zero scores from general-purpose VLMs. Therefore, STRIDE-QA establishes a comprehensive foundation for developing more reliable VLMs for safety-critical autonomous systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026 (Oral). project page: https://turingmotors.github.io/stride-qa/</p></details> |
| **[Molmo2: Open Weights and Data for Vision-Language Models with Video Understanding and Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10611v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's strongest video-language models (VLMs) remain proprietary. The strongest open-weight models either rely on synthetic data from proprietary VLMs, effectively distilling from them, or do not disclose their training data or recipe. As a result, the open-source community lacks the foundations needed to improve on the state-of-the-art video (and image) language models. Crucially, many downstream applications require more than just high-level video understanding; they require grounding -- either by pointing or by tracking in pixels. Even proprietary models lack this capability. We present Molmo2, a new family of VLMs that are state-of-the-art among open-source models and demonstrate exceptional new capabilities in point-driven grounding in single image, multi-image, and video tasks. Our key contribution is a collection of 7 new video datasets and 2 multi-image datasets, including a dataset of highly detailed video captions for pre-training, a free-form video Q&A dataset for fine-tuning, a new object tracking dataset with complex queries, and an innovative new video pointing dataset, all collected without the use of closed VLMs. We also present a training recipe for this data utilizing an efficient packing and message-tree encoding scheme, and show bi-directional attention on vision tokens and a novel token-weight strategy improves performance. Our best-in-class 8B model outperforms others in the class of open weight and data models on short videos, counting, and captioning, and is competitive on long-videos. On video-grounding Molmo2 significantly outperforms existing open-weight models like Qwen3-VL (35.5 vs 29.6 accuracy on video counting) and surpasses proprietary models like Gemini 3 Pro on some tasks (38.4 vs 20.0 F1 on video pointing and 56.2 vs 41.1 J&F on video tracking).</p></details> |  |

| **[Steering diffusion models with quadratic rewards: a fine-grained analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16570v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inference-time algorithms are an emerging paradigm in which pre-trained models are used as subroutines to solve downstream tasks. Such algorithms have been proposed for tasks ranging from inverse problems and guided image generation to reasoning. However, the methods currently deployed in practice are heuristics with a variety of failure modes -- and we have very little understanding of when these heuristics can be efficiently improved. In this paper, we consider the task of sampling from a reward-tilted diffusion model -- that is, sampling from $p^{\star}(x) \propto p(x) \exp(r(x))$ -- given a reward function $r$ and pre-trained diffusion oracle for $p$. We provide a fine-grained analysis of the computational tractability of this task for quadratic rewards $r(x) = x^\top A x + b^\top x$. We show that linear-reward tilts are always efficiently sampleable -- a simple result that seems to have gone unnoticed in the literature. We use this as a building block, along with a conceptually new ingredient -- the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform -- to provide an efficient algorithm for sampling from low-rank positive-definite quadratic tilts, i.e. $r(x) = x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite and of rank $O(1)$. For negative-definite tilts, i.e. $r(x) = - x^\top A x$ where $A$ is positive-definite, we prove that the problem is intractable even if $A$ is of rank 1 (albeit with exponentially-large entries).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey: Spatiotemporal Consistency in Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17863v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video generation aims to produce temporally coherent sequences of visual frames, representing a pivotal advancement in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC). Compared to static image generation, video generation poses unique challenges: it demands not only high-quality individual frames but also strong temporal coherence to ensure consistency throughout the spatiotemporal sequence. Although research addressing spatiotemporal consistency in video generation has increased in recent years, systematic reviews focusing on this core issue remain relatively scarce. To fill this gap, this paper views the video generation task as a sequential sampling process from a high-dimensional spatiotemporal distribution, and further discusses spatiotemporal consistency. We provide a systematic review of the latest advancements in the field. The content spans multiple dimensions including generation models, feature representations, generation frameworks, post-processing techniques, training strategies, benchmarks and evaluation metrics, with a particular focus on the mechanisms and effectiveness of various methods in maintaining spatiotemporal consistency. Finally, this paper explores future research directions and potential challenges in this field, aiming to provide valuable insights for advancing video generation technology.

| **[FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08822v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in robotic manipulation, attributed to their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits its applicability in real-time robotic systems. Existing approaches accelerate sampling in generative modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting techniques originally developed to speed up image generation. However, a major distinction exists: image generation typically produces independent samples without temporal dependencies, while robotic manipulation requires generating action trajectories with continuity and temporal coherence. To this end, we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. Concretely, we introduce a frequency consistency constraint objective that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53 tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance degradation on 40 tasks of LIBERO. Besides, we show efficiency and effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency of 93.5 Hz.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[EasyControlEdge: A Foundation-Model Fine-Tuning for Edge Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16238v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose EasyControlEdge, adapting an image-generation foundation model to edge detection. In real-world edge detection (e.g., floor-plan walls, satellite roads/buildings, and medical organ boundaries), crispness and data efficiency are crucial, yet producing crisp raw edge maps with limited training samples remains challenging. Although image-generation foundation models perform well on many downstream tasks, their pretrained priors for data-efficient transfer and iterative refinement for high-frequency detail preservation remain underexploited for edge detection. To enable crisp and data-efficient edge detection using these capabilities, we introduce an edge-specialized adaptation of image-generation foundation models. To better specialize the foundation model for edge detection, we incorporate an edge-oriented objective with an efficient pixel-space loss. At inference, we introduce guidance based on unconditional dynamics, enabling a single model to control the edge density through a guidance scale. Experiments on BSDS500, NYUDv2, BIPED, and CubiCasa compare against state-of-the-art methods and show consistent gains, particularly under no-post-processing crispness evaluation and with limited training data.</p></details> |  |
| **[PromptGuard: Soft Prompt-Guided Unsafe Content Moderation for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03544v4)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) models have exhibited remarkable performance in generating high-quality images from text descriptions. However, these models are vulnerable to misuse, particularly generating not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content, such as sexually explicit, violent, political, and disturbing images, raising serious ethical concerns. In this work, we present PromptGuard, a novel content moderation technique that draws inspiration from the system prompt mechanism in large language models (LLMs) for safety alignment. Unlike LLMs, T2I models lack a direct interface for enforcing behavioral guidelines. Our key idea is to optimize a safety soft prompt that functions as an implicit system prompt within the T2I model's textual embedding space. This universal soft prompt (P*) directly moderates NSFW inputs, enabling safe yet realistic image generation without altering the inference efficiency or requiring proxy models. We further enhance its reliability and helpfulness through a divide-and-conquer strategy, which optimizes category-specific soft prompts and combines them into holistic safety guidance. Extensive experiments across five datasets demonstrate that PromptGuard effectively mitigates NSFW content generation while preserving high-quality benign outputs. PromptGuard achieves 3.8 times faster than prior content moderation methods, surpassing eight state-of-the-art defenses with an optimal unsafe ratio down to 5.84%.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 14 tables</p></details> |

However, their iterative sampling nature results in high inference latency. While recent distillation techniques accelerate sampling, they discard intermediate trajectory steps. This sparse supervision leads to a loss of structural information and introduces significant discretization errors. To mitigate this, we propose B-DENSE, a novel framework that leverages multi-branch trajectory alignment. We modify the student architecture to output $K$-fold expanded channels, where each subset corresponds to a specific branch representing a discrete intermediate step in the teacher's trajectory. By training these branches to simultaneously map to the entire sequence of the teacher's target timesteps, we enforce dense intermediate trajectory alignment. Consequently, the student model learns to navigate the solution space from the earliest stages of training, demonstrating superior image generation quality compared to baseline distillation frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 4 algorithms and 2 tables.

| **[Prompt Reinjection: Alleviating Prompt Forgetting in Multimodal Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06886v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiTs) for text-to-image generation maintain separate text and image branches, with bidirectional information flow between text tokens and visual latents throughout denoising. In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Efficient Generative Modeling beyond Memoryless Diffusion via Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15396v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models often yield highly curved trajectories and noisy score targets due to an uninformative, memoryless forward process that induces independent data-noise coupling. We propose Adjoint Schrödinger Bridge Matching (ASBM), a generative modeling framework that recovers optimal trajectories in high dimensions via two stages. First, we view the Schrödinger Bridge (SB) forward dynamic as a coupling construction problem and learn it through a data-to-energy sampling perspective that transports data to an energy-defined prior. Then, we learn the backward generative dynamic with a simple matching loss supervised by the induced optimal coupling. By operating in a non-memoryless regime, ASBM produces significantly straighter and more efficient sampling paths. Compared to prior works, ASBM scales to high-dimensional data with notably improved stability and efficiency. Extensive experiments on image generation show that ASBM improves fidelity with fewer sampling steps. We further showcase the effectiveness of our optimal trajectory via distillation to a one-step generator.</p></details> |  |

Instead of a single patch size for all the timesteps, we introduce a Pyramidal Patchification Flow (PPFlow) approach: Large patch sizes are used for high noise timesteps and small patch sizes for low noise timesteps; Linear projections are learned for each patch size; and Unpatchify is accordingly modified. Unlike Pyramidal Flow, our approach operates over full latent representations other than pyramid representations, and adopts the normal denoising process without requiring the renoising trick. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through two training manners. Training from scratch achieves a $1.6\times$ ($2.0\times$) inference speed over SiT-B/2 for 2-level (3-level) pyramid patchification with slightly lower training FLOPs and similar image generation performance. Training from pretrained normal DiTs achieves even better performance with small training time.

In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 15 figures, Eurographics 2026, Project page: https://xdlbw.github.io/ZeroScene/</p></details> |
| **[Consistency-Preserving Diverse Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15287v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-video generation is expensive, so only a few samples are typically produced per prompt. In this low-sample regime, maximizing the value of each batch requires high cross-video diversity. Recent methods improve diversity for image generation, but for videos they often degrade within-video temporal consistency and require costly backpropagation through a video decoder. We propose a joint-sampling framework for flow-matching video generators that improves batch diversity while preserving temporal consistency. Our approach applies diversity-driven updates and then removes only the components that would decrease a temporal-consistency objective. To avoid image-space gradients, we compute both objectives with lightweight latent-space models, avoiding video decoding and decoder backpropagation. Experiments on a state-of-the-art text-to-video flow-matching model show diversity comparable to strong joint-sampling baselines while substantially improving temporal consistency and color naturalness. Code will be released.</p></details> |  |
| **[Visual Persuasion: What Influences Decisions of Vision-Language Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15278v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The web is littered with images, once created for human consumption and now increasingly interpreted by agents using vision-language models (VLMs). These agents make visual decisions at scale, deciding what to click, recommend, or buy. Yet, we know little about the structure of their visual preferences. We introduce a framework for studying this by placing VLMs in controlled image-based choice tasks and systematically perturbing their inputs. Our key idea is to treat the agent's decision function as a latent visual utility that can be inferred through revealed preference: choices between systematically edited images. Starting from common images, such as product photos, we propose methods for visual prompt optimization, adapting text optimization methods to iteratively propose and apply visually plausible modifications using an image generation model (such as in composition, lighting, or background). We then evaluate which edits increase selection probability. Through large-scale experiments on frontier VLMs, we demonstrate that optimized edits significantly shift choice probabilities in head-to-head comparisons. We develop an automatic interpretability pipeline to explain these preferences, identifying consistent visual themes that drive selection. We argue that this approach offers a practical and efficient way to surface visual vulnerabilities, safety concerns that might otherwise be discovered implicitly in the wild, supporting more proactive auditing and governance of image-based AI agents.</p></details> | 45 pages, 17 figures |

Human feedback is costly and time-consuming to obtain, which creates demand for data-efficient query selection methods. This work presents a novel approach that leverages optimal experimental design to ask humans the most informative preference queries, from which we can elucidate the latent reward function modeling user preferences efficiently. We formulate the problem of preference query selection as the one that maximizes the information about the underlying latent preference model. We show that this problem has a convex optimization formulation, and introduce a statistically and computationally efficient algorithm ED-PBRL that is supported by theoretical guarantees and can efficiently construct structured queries such as images or text. We empirically present the proposed framework by personalizing a text-to-image generative model to user-specific styles, showing that it requires less preference queries compared to random query selection.</p></details> |  |

We propose MRIQT, a 3D conditional diffusion framework for image quality transfer (IQT) from uLF to HF MRI. MRIQT combines realistic K-space degradation for physics-consistent uLF simulation, v-prediction with classifier-free guidance for stable image-to-image generation, and an SNR-weighted 3D perceptual loss for anatomical fidelity. The model denoises from a noised uLF input conditioned on the same scan, leveraging volumetric attention-UNet architecture for structure-preserving translation. Trained on a neonatal cohort with diverse pathologies, MRIQT surpasses recent GAN and CNN baselines in PSNR 15.3% with 1.78% over the state of the art, while physicians rated 85% of its outputs as good quality with clear pathology present. MRIQT enables high-fidelity, diffusion-based enhancement of portable ultra-low-field (uLF) MRI for deliable neonatal brain assessment.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Our approach works by learning an encoder that maps natural images uniformly onto a spherical latent space, and a decoder that maps random latent vectors back to the image space. Trained solely through image reconstruction losses, the model generates an image by simply decoding a random point on the sphere. Our architecture naturally supports conditional generation, and looping the encoder/decoder a few times can further enhance image quality. Across several datasets, the sphere encoder approach yields performance competitive with state of the art diffusions, but with a small fraction of the inference cost.

Image-based spatial transcriptomics technologies now provide high-resolution measurements of cell images and gene expression profiles, but existing methods typically analyze these modalities in isolation or at limited resolution. We address the problem by introducing SPATIA, a multi-level generative and predictive model that learns unified, spatially aware representations by fusing morphology, gene expression, and spatial context from the cell to the tissue level. SPATIA also incorporates a novel spatially conditioned generative framework for predicting cell morphologies under perturbations. Specifically, we propose a confidence-aware flow matching objective that reweights weak optimal-transport pairs based on uncertainty. We further apply morphology-profile alignment to encourage biologically meaningful image generation, enabling the modeling of microenvironment-dependent phenotypic transitions. We assembled a multi-scale dataset consisting of 25.9 million cell-gene pairs across 17 tissues. We benchmark SPATIA against 18 models across 12 tasks, spanning categories such as phenotype generation, annotation, clustering, gene imputation, and cross-modal prediction. SPATIA achieves improved performance over state-of-the-art models, improving generative fidelity by 8% and predictive accuracy by up to 3%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Text-Guided Convolutional Adapter for the Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14514v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Nexus Adapters, novel text-guided efficient adapters to the diffusion-based framework for the Structure Preserving Conditional Generation (SPCG). Recently, structure-preserving methods have achieved promising results in conditional image generation by using a base model for prompt conditioning and an adapter for structure input, such as sketches or depth maps. These approaches are highly inefficient and sometimes require equal parameters in the adapter compared to the base architecture. It is not always possible to train the model since the diffusion model is itself costly, and doubling the parameter is highly inefficient. In these approaches, the adapter is not aware of the input prompt; therefore, it is optimal only for the structural input but not for the input prompt. To overcome the above challenges, we proposed two efficient adapters, Nexus Prime and Slim, which are guided by prompts and structural inputs. Each Nexus Block incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to enable rich multimodal conditioning. Therefore, the proposed adapter has a better understanding of the input prompt while preserving the structure. We conducted extensive experiments on the proposed models and demonstrated that the Nexus Prime adapter significantly enhances performance, requiring only 8M additional parameters compared to the baseline, T2I-Adapter. Furthermore, we also introduced a lightweight Nexus Slim adapter with 18M fewer parameters than the T2I-Adapter, which still achieved state-of-the-art results.

However, developing a scalable generative backbone for medical imaging requires architectural efficiency, sufficient multi-organ data, and principled evaluation, yet current approaches leave these aspects unresolved. Therefore, we introduce MedVAR, the first autoregressive-based foundation model that adopts the next-scale prediction paradigm to enable fast and scale-up-friendly medical image synthesis. MedVAR generates images in a coarse-to-fine manner and produces structured multi-scale representations suitable for downstream use. To support hierarchical generation, we curate a harmonized dataset of around 440,000 CT and MRI images spanning six anatomical regions. Comprehensive experiments across fidelity, diversity, and scalability show that MedVAR achieves state-of-the-art generative performance and offers a promising architectural direction for future medical generative foundation models.</p></details> | 23 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Controlling Your Image via Simplified Vector Graphics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14443v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image generation have achieved remarkable visual quality, while a fundamental challenge remains: Can image generation be controlled at the element level, enabling intuitive modifications such as adjusting shapes, altering colors, or adding and removing objects? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing layer-wise controllable generation through simplified vector graphics (VGs). Our approach first efficiently parses images into hierarchical VG representations that are semantic-aligned and structurally coherent. Building on this representation, we design a novel image synthesis framework guided by VGs, allowing users to freely modify elements and seamlessly translate these edits into photorealistic outputs. By leveraging the structural and semantic features of VGs in conjunction with noise prediction, our method provides precise control over geometry, color, and object semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in diverse applications, including image editing, object-level manipulation, and fine-grained content creation, establishing a new paradigm for controllable image generation.

| **[Image Can Bring Your Memory Back: A Novel Multi-Modal Guided Attack against Image Generation Model Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07139v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in image generation models (IGMs), particularly diffusion-based architectures such as Stable Diffusion (SD), have markedly enhanced the quality and diversity of AI-generated visual content. However, their generative capability has also raised significant ethical, legal, and societal concerns, including the potential to produce harmful, misleading, or copyright-infringing content. To mitigate these concerns, machine unlearning (MU) emerges as a promising solution by selectively removing undesirable concepts from pretrained models. Nevertheless, the robustness and effectiveness of existing unlearning techniques remain largely unexplored, particularly in the presence of multi-modal adversarial inputs. To bridge this gap, we propose Recall, a novel adversarial framework explicitly designed to compromise the robustness of unlearned IGMs. Unlike existing approaches that predominantly rely on adversarial text prompts, Recall exploits the intrinsic multi-modal conditioning capabilities of diffusion models by efficiently optimizing adversarial image prompts with guidance from a single semantically relevant reference image. Extensive experiments across ten state-of-the-art unlearning methods and diverse tasks show that Recall consistently outperforms existing baselines in terms of adversarial effectiveness, computational efficiency, and semantic fidelity with the original textual prompt. These findings reveal critical vulnerabilities in current unlearning mechanisms and underscore the need for more robust solutions to ensure the safety and reliability of generative models.

Existing diffusion-based editing methods often struggle to maintain consistency across multiple conditions due to limited interaction between reference inputs. To address this, we introduce Sequence-Extended Latent Fusion (SELF), a unified input representation that dynamically serializes multiple reference images into a coherent latent sequence. During a dedicated training stage, all reference images are jointly constrained to fit within a fixed-length sequence under a global pixel-budget constraint. Building upon SELF, we propose a two-stage training framework comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). In the SFT stage, we jointly train on single-image editing and multi-image composition tasks to establish a robust generative prior. We adopt a progressive sequence length training strategy, in which all input images are initially resized to a total pixel budget of $1024^2$, and are then gradually increased to $1536^2$ and $2048^2$ to improve visual fidelity and cross-reference consistency. This gradual relaxation of compression enables the model to incrementally capture finer visual details while maintaining stable alignment across references. For the RL stage, we introduce Multi-Source GRPO (MSGRPO), to our knowledge the first reinforcement learning framework tailored for multi-reference image generation. MSGRPO optimizes the model to reconcile conflicting visual constraints, significantly enhancing compositional consistency. We will open-source the code, models, training data, and reward data for community research purposes.</p></details> |  |

However, existing visual tokenizers typically struggle to satisfy these conflicting objectives within a single framework. In this paper, we introduce UniWeTok, a unified discrete tokenizer designed to bridge this gap using a massive binary codebook ($\mathit{2^{128}}$). For training framework, we introduce Pre-Post Distillation and a Generative-Aware Prior to enhance the semantic extraction and generative prior of the discrete tokens. In terms of model architecture, we propose a convolution-attention hybrid architecture with the SigLu activation function. SigLu activation not only bounds the encoder output and stabilizes the semantic distillation process but also effectively addresses the optimization conflict between token entropy loss and commitment loss. We further propose a three-stage training framework designed to enhance UniWeTok's adaptability cross various image resolutions and perception-sensitive scenarios, such as those involving human faces and textual content. On ImageNet, UniWeTok achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance (FID: UniWeTok 1.38 vs. REPA 1.42) while requiring a remarkably low training compute (Training Tokens: UniWeTok 33B vs. REPA 262B). On general-domain, UniWeTok demonstrates highly competitive capabilities across a broad range of tasks, including multimodal understanding, image generation (DPG Score: UniWeTok 86.63 vs. FLUX.1 [Dev] 83.84), and editing (GEdit Overall Score: UniWeTok 5.09 vs. OmniGen 5.06). We release code and models to facilitate community exploration of unified tokenizer and MLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 9 figures, 33 tables</p></details> |

With high-entropy binary latents, BitDance lets each token represent up to $2^{256}$ states, yielding a compact yet highly expressive discrete representation. Sampling from such a huge token space is difficult with standard classification. To resolve this, BitDance uses a binary diffusion head: instead of predicting an index with softmax, it employs continuous-space diffusion to generate the binary tokens. Furthermore, we propose next-patch diffusion, a new decoding method that predicts multiple tokens in parallel with high accuracy, greatly speeding up inference. On ImageNet 256x256, BitDance achieves an FID of 1.24, the best among AR models. With next-patch diffusion, BitDance beats state-of-the-art parallel AR models that use 1.4B parameters, while using 5.4x fewer parameters (260M) and achieving 8.7x speedup. For text-to-image generation, BitDance trains on large-scale multimodal tokens and generates high-resolution, photorealistic images efficiently, showing strong performance and favorable scaling. When generating 1024x1024 images, BitDance achieves a speedup of over 30x compared to prior AR models. We release code and models to facilitate further research on AR foundation models.

| **[Towards Sequence Modeling Alignment between Tokenizer and Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05289v3)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive image generation aims to predict the next token based on previous ones. However, this process is challenged by the bidirectional dependencies inherent in conventional image tokenizations, which creates a fundamental misalignment with the unidirectional nature of autoregressive models. To resolve this, we introduce AliTok, a novel Aligned Tokenizer that alters the dependency structure of the token sequence. AliTok employs a bidirectional encoder constrained by a causal decoder, a design that compels the encoder to produce a token sequence with both semantic richness and forward-dependency. Furthermore, by incorporating prefix tokens and employing a two-stage tokenizer training process to enhance reconstruction performance, AliTok achieves high fidelity and predictability simultaneously. Building upon AliTok, a standard decoder-only autoregressive model with just 177M parameters achieves a gFID of 1.44 and an IS of 319.5 on ImageNet-256. Scaling to 662M, our model reaches a gFID of 1.28, surpassing the SOTA diffusion method with 10x faster sampling. On ImageNet-512, our 318M model also achieves a SOTA gFID of 1.39.

| **[Consistent text-to-image generation via scene de-contextualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14553v2)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Consistent text-to-image (T2I) generation seeks to produce identity-preserving images of the same subject across diverse scenes, yet it often fails due to a phenomenon called identity (ID) shift. Previous methods have tackled this issue, but typically rely on the unrealistic assumption of knowing all target scenes in advance. This paper reveals that a key source of ID shift is the native correlation between subject and scene context, called scene contextualization, which arises naturally as T2I models fit the training distribution of vast natural images. We formally prove the near-universality of this scene-ID correlation and derive theoretical bounds on its strength. On this basis, we propose a novel, efficient, training-free prompt embedding editing approach, called Scene De-Contextualization (SDeC), that imposes an inversion process of T2I's built-in scene contextualization. Specifically, it identifies and suppresses the latent scene-ID correlation within the ID prompt's embedding by quantifying the SVD directional stability to adaptively re-weight the corresponding eigenvalues. Critically, SDeC allows for per-scene use (one scene per prompt) without requiring prior access to all target scenes. This makes it a highly flexible and general solution well-suited to real-world applications where such prior knowledge is often unavailable or varies over time. Experiments demonstrate that SDeC significantly enhances identity preservation while maintaining scene diversity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, existing tuning-free methods typically employ Spatially Uniform Visual Injection, causing identity features to contaminate non-facial regions (e.g., backgrounds and lighting) and degrading text adherence. To address this without expensive fine-tuning, we propose SpatialID, a training-free spatially-adaptive identity modulation framework. SpatialID fundamentally decouples identity injection into face-relevant and context-free regions using a Spatial Mask Extractor derived from cross-attention responses. Furthermore, we introduce a Temporal-Spatial Scheduling strategy that dynamically adjusts spatial constraints - transitioning from Gaussian priors to attention-based masks and adaptive relaxation - to align with the diffusion generation dynamics. Extensive experiments on IBench demonstrate that SpatialID achieves state-of-the-art performance in text adherence (CLIP-T: 0.281), visual consistency (CLIP-I: 0.827), and image quality (IQ: 0.523), significantly eliminating background contamination while maintaining robust identity preservation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent Denoising Makes Good Tokenizers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15856v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite their fundamental role, it remains unclear what properties could make tokenizers more effective for generative modeling. We observe that modern generative models share a conceptually similar training objective -- reconstructing clean signals from corrupted inputs, such as signals degraded by Gaussian noise or masking -- a process we term denoising. Motivated by this insight, we propose aligning tokenizer embeddings directly with the downstream denoising objective, encouraging latent embeddings that remain reconstructable even under significant corruption. To achieve this, we introduce the Latent Denoising Tokenizer (l-DeTok), a simple yet highly effective tokenizer trained to reconstruct clean images from latent embeddings corrupted via interpolative noise or random masking. Extensive experiments on class-conditioned (ImageNet 256x256 and 512x512) and text-conditioned (MSCOCO) image generation benchmarks demonstrate that our l-DeTok consistently improves generation quality across six representative generative models compared to prior tokenizers. Our findings highlight denoising as a fundamental design principle for tokenizer development, and we hope it could motivate new perspectives for future tokenizer design.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at: https://github.com/Jiawei-Yang/DeTok</p></details> |

Although faster generation methods such as flow matching are gradually replacing diffusion methods, researchers are pursuing even faster generation suitable for interactive robot control. MeanFlow, as a one-step variant of flow matching, has shown strong potential in image generation, but its precision in action generation does not meet the stringent requirements of robotic manipulation. We therefore propose \textbf{HybridFlow}, a \textbf{3-stage method} with \textbf{2-NFE}: Global Jump in MeanFlow mode, ReNoise for distribution alignment, and Local Refine in ReFlow mode. This method balances inference speed and generation quality by leveraging the rapid advantage of MeanFlow one-step generation while ensuring action precision with minimal generation steps. Through real-world experiments, HybridFlow outperforms the 16-step Diffusion Policy by \textbf{15--25\%} in success rate while reducing inference time from 152ms to 19ms (\textbf{8$\times$ speedup}, \textbf{$\sim$52Hz}); it also achieves 70.0\% success on unseen-color OOD grasping and 66.3\% on deformable object folding. We envision HybridFlow as a practical low-latency method to enhance real-world interaction capabilities of robotic manipulation policies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diff-Aid: Inference-time Adaptive Interaction Denoising for Rectified Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13585v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved remarkable advancement, yet faithfully following complex textual descriptions remains challenging due to insufficient interactions between textual and visual features. Prior approaches enhance such interactions via architectural design or handcrafted textual condition weighting, but lack flexibility and overlook the dynamic interactions across different blocks and denoising stages. To provide a more flexible and efficient solution to this problem, we propose Diff-Aid, a lightweight inference-time method that adaptively adjusts per-token text and image interactions across transformer blocks and denoising timesteps. Beyond improving generation quality, Diff-Aid yields interpretable modulation patterns that reveal how different blocks, timesteps, and textual tokens contribute to semantic alignment during denoising. As a plug-and-play module, Diff-Aid can be seamlessly integrated into downstream applications for further improvement, including style LoRAs, controllable generation, and zero-shot editing. Experiments on strong baselines (SD 3.5 and FLUX) demonstrate consistent improvements in prompt adherence, visual quality, and human preference across various metrics. Our code and models will be released.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Autoregressive Image Generation with Randomized Parallel Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10568v3)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ARPG, a novel visual autoregressive model that enables randomized parallel generation, addressing the inherent limitations of conventional raster-order approaches, which hinder inference efficiency and zero-shot generalization due to their sequential, predefined token generation order. Our key insight is that effective random-order modeling necessitates explicit guidance for determining the position of the next predicted token. To this end, we propose a novel decoupled decoding framework that decouples positional guidance from content representation, encoding them separately as queries and key-value pairs. By directly incorporating this guidance into the causal attention mechanism, our approach enables fully random-order training and generation, eliminating the need for bidirectional attention. Consequently, ARPG readily generalizes to zero-shot inference tasks such as image inpainting, outpainting, and resolution expansion. Furthermore, it supports parallel inference by concurrently processing multiple queries using a shared KV cache. On the ImageNet-1K 256 benchmark, our approach attains an FID of 1.83 with only 32 sampling steps, achieving over a 30 times speedup in inference and a 75 percent reduction in memory consumption compared to representative recent autoregressive models at a similar scale.</p></details> |  |
